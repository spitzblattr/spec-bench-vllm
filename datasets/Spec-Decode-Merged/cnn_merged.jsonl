In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted \"God is great\" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. \"Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,\" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. \"They will be like wounded animals.\" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians.

Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. \"As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,\" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. \"There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,\" he told the Society of Editors meeting. According to Evans, there had been \"no decrease\" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War. He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. \"A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,\" he said.

Julio Cruz is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Juventus. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender  Walter Samuel to leave goalkeeper Julio Cesar helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Argentine striker Julio Cruz broke Juve's offside trap and latched onto Brazilian midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Gianluigi Buffon. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Empoli. First half goals from French winger Ludovic Giuly and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Romans in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory.

Dida's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in UEFA suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always unlikely. UEFA's control and disciplinary body found Celtic guilty of charges of \"lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters\", while Dida was found to have breached UEFA's \"principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\". Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. \"It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive,\" said Milan lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. \"It seems to us a very, very unbalanced sentence. It turns Dida into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view.\" Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month.

Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Andres Granier's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north. The Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its \"critical\" level and gushed into the city's center, according to AP. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Felipe Calderon visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina.

Dida has had one game of his two-match ban suspended for a year following an appeal to UEFA. Brazilian Dida was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by European football's ruling body following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic in Scotland on October 3. The 34-year-old Brazilian was initially banned for two games for his theatrics following a Celtic fan's encroachment onto the pitch during the 2-1 defeat at Celtic Park. \"Following Monday's appeals hearing, Dida is suspended for two matches, but one of the matches will now be deferred for a probationary period of one year,\" said a stement on UEFA's Web site. Dida sits out the home tie against Shakhtar on Wednesday after an inquiry based on Article 5, paragraph 1 of the UEFA disciplinary regulations (Principles of conduct), under which \"member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\". However, Dida will only serve the second match of his ban if he commits a similar offense -- a theatrical over-reaction --during the next 12 months, freeing him for the trip to Ukraine. UEFA said that their Appeals Body \"took note that Dida expressed his sincere regrets as regards his conduct during the match.\" AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was satisfied with UEFA's decision. \"I believe it is fair -- I was against the two-game suspension but one seems OK. \"Dida has made a mistake but his error did not hinder anyone, not Celtic, nor any player,\" said Galliani.

Augustin Binya, right, lunges towards Celtic midfielder Scott Brown during Benfica's 1-0 defeat in Glasgow. The Cameroon international was sent off for the challenge in his side's 1-0 defeat in the Champions League match in Glasgow last Wednesday. Scotland international Brown avoided injury, but claimed Binya had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that Europe's governing body take further action. Binya, 24, apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee Martin Hansson of Sweden as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match. But UEFA's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on Friday morning, having deliberated on the case on Thursday. In a statement on uefa.com, Binya's challenge was described as one which \"seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player\". Benfica can appeal against the ban, which rules Binya out of the Portuguese club's remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk. If unsuccessful, he will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the Champions League or UEFA Cup. The suspension will also carry over to future seasons if, as seems likely, Benfica finish bottom of Group D and bow out of Europe for this campaign.

He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 956, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal."}

President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to \"contain himself.\" And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president \"could do better.\" Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. \"It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"That's a very bad deal. \" Netanyahu said Iran is a country of \"congenital cheating\" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. \"I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful,\" Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu \"would contain himself.\" The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are \"on the cusp of something that can be workable.\" \"It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes,\" Feinstein said. \"But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world.\" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the \"breakout\" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the \"almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal.\" \"We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb,\" he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on \"Face the Nation\" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a \"new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama.\" And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. \"Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better,\" Graham said."}

What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. \"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,\" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: \"Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.\" \"Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza\" tweeted Aღanda. \"Just mock them for their ignorance.\" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. \"Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!\" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  \"Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.\" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. \"Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?\" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads \"bigots.\" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. \"Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?\" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. \"Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,\" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. \"What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,\" tweeted Savannah. \"Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere.\" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is \"to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,\" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. \"That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,\" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. \"You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be.\" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  \"just an ordinary woman from Indonesia\" who, like many others, was \"forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true.\" \"She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family,\" Jumiati wrote. \"She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment.\" According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. \"If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life,\" he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed."}

The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for \"partnership certificates\" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. \"It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing,\" Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. \"What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society,\"  Matsunaka said . \"It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing.\" Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, told CNN the ordinance was a \"big first step for the protection of human rights.\" He called the decision \"happy\" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it \"should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding (LGBT individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young.\" Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya's lead. However, former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement's momentum for granted. \"To realize equal rights for gay couples, a national law has to be made,\" he said. While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan, its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage. Many hide their sexuality from their employers, co-workers, families and friends. But the tide may be turning. A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4% oppose gay marriage, but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70%. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which commissioned the poll, welcomed the Shibuya decision, calling it \"a bold and important step forward.\" Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan's constitution, but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation, according to Mari Miura, a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. \"The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage, so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional,\" Miura told Bloomberg Business. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party \"don't like the idea of same-sex marriage, but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum.\" Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition, with one, known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education, telling the Japan Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the \"familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history.\" While Shibuya's registration system will be a first for Japan, Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community. In 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced, and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to LGBT individuals.

Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility \"out of an abundance of caution\" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. \"Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,\" the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters.

And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. Under the rain of coalition bombs, the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country, still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemen's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes. He fired his former Army chief of staff, Hussein Khairan, on Sunday. The firing had no practical effect, since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels' acting defense minister. Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia, which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him. Fighting has ended dozens of lives each day. On Monday, more than 50 people died in the port city of Aden alone, where Houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to Hadi on the ground, Agence France-Press reported. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. \"Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,\" said Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East. \"Medical supplies need to be here yesterday,\" said ICRC spokeswoman Marie-Claire Feghali from Sanaa. \"We need to save the lives that can be saved.\" Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies, the other with workers. But flying in will be hard, since most airlines have canceled their flights, and airstrikes have taken out many airfields. On Monday, the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in Djibouti, Feghali said. The ICRC is hoping to fly out in a day or two. Following the ICRC's call, on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia's behest. Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing key elements. It didn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to intervene with force. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border. Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail. Hadi's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP, but with the Houthi takeover, that arrangement has evaporated, and the terror group operates generally unchecked."}

Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan. But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist. \"After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists,\" David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told CNN in a statement. The FBI had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf. Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono, in the southern province of Maguindanao. The mission went disastrously awry. Forty-four members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit were killed in the assault, targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government. According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last month, the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS. In the immediate aftermath of the assault, the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire, before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a \"blocking force\" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with MILF fighters. According to the IPAC report, the SAF \"blocking\" company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived, . Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died. The clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the MILF, authorities said. A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest. Bowdich expressed the FBI's \"sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive.\" While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines. The IPAC report argued that the \"single-minded focus\" of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF, which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress. \"The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy,\" read the report, which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not \"the master bomber that his reputation suggested.\" Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies, killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations, for fear of word leaking to their target. The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan's who described the Malaysian as \"a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon.\" READ MORE: Dozens of Philippine police killed in raid on 'high value' bomb makers .

Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of \"preserving social stability.\" Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of \"taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money\" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be \"open\" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign,  targeting both \"tigers\" and \"flies\" --  high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. \"The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,\" longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. The former Chongqing Communist Party chief's supporters, however, have long called him a political victim --  the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political watchers see similarities between the Bo and Zhou cases. \"The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles,\" said Lam, who has predicted a suspended death sentence for Zhou."}

Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul."}

And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. \"For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick,\" Stewart said.  \"You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens.\" A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is \"extremely rare.\"  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired \"third-party specialists\" to help in the hunt for Felix. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search,\" Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. \"We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\" Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. \"You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage,\" Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. \"We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will,\" she said."}

She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes. Farther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing. It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns. Rochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said. On Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media. Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A  large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  \"It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants,\" said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out. \"We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them.\" People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured,  Widick said. Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour. People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said. In Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of Olson's friends' homes. A safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before. He'd have a job ahead of him. \"I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, \"but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe,\" she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable. The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said. Only foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. \"You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be,\" he said. Lindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area. VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. \"I've got the clothes on my back,\" he said. But his family wasn't at home when it hit. \"My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived.\" It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. \"I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado.\" He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes. The service warned of a \"particularly dangerous situation.\" People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday.

The Indiana woman's story became known around the world last year when she was able to realize her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up the opening game of its schedule to accommodate her desire to play. Hill died early Friday. At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost \"an unselfish angel.\" \"It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,\" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. \"But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many.\" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill: . \"I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others.\" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. The organization called her a \"worldwide inspiration.\" \"Lauren captured the hearts of people worldwide with her tenacity and determination to play in her first collegiate basketball game with her Mount St. Joseph University team,\" the group said on Facebook. People we've lost in 2015 . Mount St. Joseph University President Tony Artez said Hill's \"love and laughter will remain in our hearts.\" \"We are forever grateful to have had Lauren grace our campus with her smile and determined spirit,\" Artez said in a statement. \"She has left a powerful legacy. She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift.\" Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. \"Lauren's message was constantly positive,\" he told CNN. \"We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive.\" As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the \"true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership.\" \"The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many,\" Twitter user Just_AP wrote. \"Lauren Hill did that.\" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's \"enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story.\" \"Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on,\" he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. \"I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,\" she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time. She had already committed to play for Mount St. Joseph when she was diagnosed. In October, the school received permission from the NCAA to move up its first scheduled game so Hill could play. In front of a sellout crowd, many wearing T-shirts bearing her name and slogan, \"Never Give Up,\" watched the ballplayer score the first two points and the final layup of the game. \"Today has been the best day I've ever had,\" Hill told the crowd after the game. \"I don't know what to say but thank you.\" CNN's Jill Martin, Emanuella Grinberg and Faith Karimi contributed to this report."}

Booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers, Ryan Gosling's first feature as director has been divisive, to put it mildly. But there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole: its setting, a besmirched and decaying Detroit. Wavering on the brink of annihilation, yet providing kindling for its own rebirth, the city is captured in all its waning splendor, the perfect backdrop for Gosling's post-industrial gothic. Speaking about the film in London, Gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact, without Detroit's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all. Gosling said that \"Lost River\" began as a collection of speculative shots of the Brewster-Douglass Projects, the first black social housing development in America and a place Motown legends The Supremes and boxer Joe Louis once called home. \"I heard [the authorities] were going to tear them down,\" Gosling said. \"I had to shoot them before they did.\" Taking time out between acting jobs, he ventured into the projects. \"I started shooting more and more,\" he explained, \"and then I realized that I was making a film. Then I started writing [the script] during the process of filming.\" Gosling's affection for the Motor City is longstanding, the actor growing up \"not too far away\" in Cornwall, Ontario. \"It seemed like everything cool came from Detroit... the whole American Dream,\" he reminisces. \"The Model-T, Motown, the refrigerator...\" Now though he references \"40 miles of dead neighborhoods,\" the city declaring bankruptcy. \"Houses are burning and things are being torn down,\" he says, \"and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes. For them it has become a nightmare and I wanted to make a film about that.\" The title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced, its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions. Speaking in broader terms, Gosling argues \"there are Lost Rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having.\" On screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted. The director plainly states that as a location it \"was pretty dangerous.\" He describes \"an energy there that was threatening... We had a very charmed experience [filming]. It worked its way into the fabric of the movie --- a tone of impending threat that was just there.\" However there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos, on camera and off. For the film's young protagonist, every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed. Similarly, Gosling references the Heidelberg Project during the discussion, a community organization in the city's McDougall-Hunt neighborhood, reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists. He recalls seeing \"one house covered with teddy bears, another covered in clocks... people taking spaces and personalizing them.\" The city's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw. \"Something really interesting is happening in Detroit at the moment -- a rebirth. People redefining what they are,\" according to Gosling. \"There's a resilience there and an energy, and it's exciting.\" As much as the visual content of \"Lost River\" revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world's perception of Detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city. Gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing Detroit, and is precisely what the film is trying to convey. \"We want people to know that dereliction is happening there, but that it's not only what is happening there,\" he argues. \"It doesn't define Detroit, it's just part of what it's dealing with right now.\" \"Lost River\" receives a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and UK on April 10."}

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report."}

What exactly is \"service of process\"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go \"off the grid\". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is \"nail and mail\" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of \"service\" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, \"traditional\" doesn't necessarily mean \"good.\"  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be \"liked\" by all your gawking \"friends,\" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we \"live\" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email."}

When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland.

She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park.

{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 872, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Emy Afalava is a loyal American and decorated veteran.  He was born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900. He has been subject to American law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen. The Constitution would agree.  The Fourteenth Amendment declares that \"All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Yet, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen.  How can it be, in the 21st century, that Americans born on U.S. soil are denied the rights of citizenship? That injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of American Samoa to join the United States.  It is a wrong that Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision could come any day. Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens.  The rule is colorblind, yet the only exception that the Supreme Court has ever declared was not. The infamous Dred Scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free African-Americans had \"no rights that the white man was bound to respect.\"  Though they were Americans, they were not citizens under the Constitution. A Civil War later, the 14th Amendment reversed the ruling in the Dred Scott case. Today, the Dred Scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. But racial discrimination didn't end there. In 1904, a Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez sailed for New York.  Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen.  But officials at Ellis Island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland.  She sued, with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling. Yet the Supreme Court that eventually heard Gonzalez's case was still racist.  In preceding years, for example, it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the Chinese race. And, in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as Puerto Rico, the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class U.S. territories.  Justice Edward Douglas White's opinion stated that U.S. sovereignty extended over them, but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other Americans.  He did so, he privately revealed, because \"he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions.\" In the Gonzalez case, the justices agreed unanimously that Puerto Ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws.  But they declined to decide whether or not Gonzalez was a citizen.  Though preoccupied by fears that islanders were \"savages\" and racially unfit for citizenship, they were unwilling to violate the Constitution. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to \"precedents in our history of which we are least proud.\" Those precedents, he warned the Court, had been \"repudiated by the American people in the Civil War, by three amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by this court, and by ... advancing civilization.\" Surely, 147 years after the Dred Scott case was overturned, the time has come to put an end to this farce. In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Today, Emy Afalava and his fellow American Samoans are the last Americans still waiting to become citizens."}

Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples: . Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, \"It took so long. It moved so slowly.\" His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. \"I thought I lost you.\" Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific . What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. \"I thought, 'I am going to get out,\" he said. \"Get out, get out, get out.\" Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went \"backwards all night long.\" At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, \"I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it.\" He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu \"weak, hungry and dehydrated\" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea \"because they had become badly decomposed.\" Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed \"severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition,\" according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. \"For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family,\" his mother said by phone, \"to be more understanding and loving.\" Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. \"I was saved by holding onto the roof,\" the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. \"But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, \"I thought today was the last day of my life.\""}

Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from \"substantially burdening\" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are \"exceedingly rare,\" and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. \"There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers,\" wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon: . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected,\" Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means \"the union of the plants,\" cited that federal law in suing the federal government. \"The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca,\" the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. \"The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA,\" the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely \"retaliation against the kosher inmates\" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited \"the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida.\" Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a \"dangerous weapon\" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as \"a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings,\" they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. \"The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000,\" Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. \"Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing,\" he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid \"the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA,\" according to a League of California Cities report in 2002. CNN's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report."}

A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1973, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "Boston (CNN)Adrianne Haslet-Davis and her husband, Adam Davis, were standing near the finish line on the day of the Boston Marathon bombing. Her feet were sore from wearing 4.5-inch heels. Still, they walked to Boylston Street to watch the runners. \"We were so in love and happy together,\" she told a federal jury Wednesday. It was the second day the Boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named Tsarnaev exploded near the finish line. The jury must decide whether bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. Haslet-Davis and Davis, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the explosion near the Forum restaurant. She recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that April day in 2013. She knew right away it was a terrorist attack. Screams and heavy smoke filled the air. She couldn't hear her own screams. She thought she was dead. When her husband, who also was injured, lifted her leg, he too let out a scream. She said she thought he was in shock. She rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass, shredding her arms. She dragged herself to the Forum. \"I saw all five of my toes, but I saw a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I didn't see my ankle.\" A ballroom dancer, Haslet-Davis' left leg would later be amputated below the knee. Inside the Forum, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey. \"I just wanted the pain to go away. I only begged for the whiskey when I thought I was going to die.\" When someone removed Adam's shoe, an artery was spurting blood. His face got whiter and whiter, she said. His eye rolled back. She thought he was dead. At a hospital, she called her parents on her cellphone. She told them she was in a terrorist attack. \"I don't think I have a left foot anymore,\" she told her father. \"I'm in really bad shape and I really need to talk to you because this might be it.\" Her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over. \"I don't care if it's illegal. I need to talk to you because these might be our last words. I said I was in a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon and Adam is dead and this might be it for me.\" Haslet-Davis told the jury that, at the Forum, her husband kept telling her he was sorry. \"That was all he could say. That he loved me. He was so sorry.\" Her husband, she said, has since \"bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the VA hospital.\" After her testimony, Haslet-Davis walked slowly off the stand. She appeared to glare at Tsarnaev, who did not look at her. Earlier this week, prosecutors showed jurors an image of Tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell. It was dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a gesture that Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said showed a young man who was \"unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\" On Wednesday, Tsarnaev's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, sought to discredit the use of the image. She suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context. On cross-examination of a deputy U.S. marshal, Conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken. In it, Tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair. Moments before, he has two fingers up, forming what Conrad called a \"V sign,\" before raising his middle finger. Gary Olivera, a deputy U.S. Marshal for 14 years, admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and Tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror. \"A lot of times people do that to get our attention,\" Olivera said. Also Wednesday, Jinyan Zhao told the jury about her niece, Lingzi Lu, a \"beautiful nerd\" and graduate student at Boston University who was killed in the bombing. Lingzi Lu was originally from China but was buried in Boston. \"How she died, and why she died, it just felt like she is part of Boston, part of city,\" her aunt said. \"The thinking is she should just be here.\" The family, Zhao said, put a music box and some books in her casket. Her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand. Later, her mother described her beautiful hand. Zhao recalled what Lu's mother said to her: \" 'No matter what I don't want to believe it is her hand.' \" The brother and stepfather of Sean Collier also took the stand Wednesday. Collier was the MIT police officer who was shot in his patrol car, another victim of the Tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture. Sean Collier always wanted to be a cop, said his brother. He was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong. Either you did it or you didn't. \"We thought it was typical little boy stuff, but he never grew out of it,\" Andrew Collier told the jury. \"Sean was always the one to spill the beans,\" said Joe Rodgers, 59, who married Collier's mother, Kelly, in 1993. \"He was a cop from an early age.\" On a Thursday night in April 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head. His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. The officer who found Collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple, neck and head. He was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him. Collier would become the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. The night still feels like a dream for Rodgers. \"He had a hole in the middle of his head,\" Rodgers said. \"He was shot to pieces. He was just laying there. My wife was touching him, and his blood was coming up in her hands.\" Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S. Prosecutors said the brothers killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an \"officer down\" at MIT. Less than two weeks after Tsarneav was found guilty on every count, the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds. Earlier, MIT Police Chief John DiFava told the jury that he hired Collier, who fit in \"perfectly\" because of his policing style and engaging personality.

Since Sean's death, she's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children.\" Kelly became pregnant with Sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two, Rodgers said. His birth lifted her out of depression. \"He was special,\" he said, adding that Sean is now buried alongside the baby. Rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later. \"There's something missing,\" he said. \"Thanksgiving and Christmas will never be the same.\" Collier's brother Andrew said, \"Even when we're having fun, there's always a cloud over us. I miss Sean. I miss everything about him.\" The prosecution is expected to rest Friday, according to an official with insight into the prosecutor's plans.

But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown."}

Humans never have lived on a planet that's 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark. \"This is gambling with the planet,\" said Gernot Wagner, the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book \"Climate Shock.\" Think super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions. Yet for all of its importance, I don't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. I've heard it referred to as the \"north star\" for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world's attention. It's so significant that it's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year. I'm calling that effort \"2 degrees,\" and I need your help to make it work. Until 5 p.m. ET Monday, you can vote on the first story I'll report for the series. Vote using the Facebook poll below (or go here if you don't see it.) Tell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees . All of those story ideas came from you, by the way. They focus on what a 2-degree world might look like. CNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically. I don't have all the answers right now. We'll continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below you'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own. If you'd like to follow this project as it evolves, I'd encourage you to sign up for the \"2 degrees\" newsletter. And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They'll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number. One guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale. Nordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled \"Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem.\" The estimate was \"crude, but it was a reasonable first start,\" he told me. \"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years,\" he wrote in \"The Climate Casino.\" A growing body of research now supports the idea. Science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want. \"You need a judgment call for these things,\" said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. \"And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy.\" Germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission, the G8, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord, which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much. The United States was among the signatories. I'm going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council,  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank. • Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size. • Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.• A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at \"increasingly high risk of extinction\" at or near the 2-degree mark.• The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.• Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.• The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. So ... not good. And numbers don't convey the emotional toll. \"I'm from New Mexico,\" said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. \"I love it there, and I know it's going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won't be as good. The hiking won't be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It's one of my things I love most. And that's obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it's in peril. That's just for starters.\" No one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory. Plus, everyone hates a fraction. Targeting 1 degree of warming is \"ridiculous because you can't do it,\" said Nordhaus, the economist. \"Three sounds too high. And you can't have a fraction because it's too complicated. \"So two is kind of an obvious number.\" The climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution. And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we're already putting into the atmosphere, even with \"very ambitious mitigation action\" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is \"locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system,\" that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt. Yes, but it won't be easy. \"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree,\" said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum. Here's the best guess for what that \"amazing speed\" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. \"It depends on how much risk you want to accept,\" she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York, want to accept less risk than that. \"Our position is 100% clean energy,\" said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz. If we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate, we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury. Scarier still, we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100. Some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it's too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that \"north star\" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem. If you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse. The IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by \"major extinctions around the globe\" and a \"reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide.\" Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we're looking a \"catastro-f***\" that would be almost \"infinitely costly,\" said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. \"It's akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet.\" This much should be clear: Something has to change. If we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that's still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal. Please be in touch! I need your help to make this work. Email questions to: climate (at) cnn (dot) com.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1947, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. \"That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,\" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. \"I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,\" attorney Mary Koch said this week, \"I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents \"an inflection point,\" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a \"continuation in a process toward justice.\" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a \"duty to protect the justice process.\" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to \"seek justice for optics\" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: \"Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end.\" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. \"We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,\" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI \"will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks.\" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess \"policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens.\" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. \"Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,\" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. \"We welcome outside review,\" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. \"We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened.\" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he \"fled unprovoked.\" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. \"We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,\" he said. \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a \"rough ride\" or \"nickel ride,\" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is \"potential\" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. \"That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,\" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again \"to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. \"It's complex,\" Davis said of the probe. \"It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1825, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)I was a copygirl in my fourth month at the Chicago Daily News, my second assigned to the city desk.  It had become my custom at 4 o'clock, when the city desk secretary left for the day, to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day. It was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago, on Thursday, April 12, 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks.  The second city editor, Guy Housley, was to my left.  To my right, perhaps 6 feet away, the telegraph editor, George Dodge. At 4:50, the old-fashioned upright \"candlestick\" telephone on his desk rang -- the direct line The Associated Press used to alert editors to major news events.  He answered, replaced the bell-like receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular, \"Roosevelt is dead.\" The silence of shock. Until Dodge jumped up so quickly, his swivel chair crashed into the glass-fronted bookcase behind him -- a symphonic orchestra cymbals sound -- and ran to what was called the Tube Room, with its row of Associated Press Teletype machines. Housley said, \"Clear the decks for action.\" The words had barely cleared his lips when City Editor Clem Lane half-ran back into the city room.  Hal O'Flaherty, director of the Daily News Foreign Service, was only a step or two behind.  The door of the managing editor's office that opened into the city room flew open, and Managing Editor Everett Norlander joined them around the copy desk, where Dodge was editing the bulletin. Lane wheeled toward the rewrite desk.  \"Cleveland!  Get downstairs.  Get the reaction.\" The main entrance to the Chicago Daily News building also served as the main entrance to the Northwestern Railroad terminal, with its commuter trains to the North Shore communities.  A veritable sea of lemmings would be coming up that marble incline for the next hour.  Not that Charlie Cleveland could linger. The Daily News, an afternoon newspaper, was strictly limited in the hours it could publish.  Only an hour or so remained for EXTRAs. I knew clips would be needed and ran to the library, the old \"morgue.\"  They'd heard and had a splay of white envelopes on President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- big and bulging -- spread out.  They had one, as I recall -- a small one -- on Harry S. Truman.  I grabbed it and ran back down the corridor. Bob Lewin, who usually handled labor stories, had been told \"to do something on the new president.\"  He opened the Truman envelope, spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the \"books\" in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen: five sheets of copy paper stapled together, with four sheets of carbon paper between.  To be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies: the top one for the editor, a carbon copy for the reporter's reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks . Lewin's eyes moved over the clippings, evaluating, rejecting, selecting, deciding what to use.  At last, he started typing.  Because of the time pressure, the story would be done in \"short takes\": two, maybe three paragraphs at a time. He wrote: . \"The new President -- the 33d in the history of the United States -- is Harry S. Truman. \"He was automatically elevated to the presidency on the death of President Roosevelt. \"Truman will be 61 on May 8.\" Lewin ripped the book out of the typewriter roller.  I left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to Lane. Back by Lewin, I read over his shoulder: . \"Born in Lamar, Mo., Truman's political rise was spectacular. \"He was relatively little known outside of his home state when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1934.  He had the backing of the late Tom \"Boss\" Prendergast, of the Kansas City machine. This time, Lewin gave me a nod.  I pulled out the book, the typewriter roller ratcheting protest. After two more takes, Lane said, \"Okay, that's it.\" Cleveland was back.  The cricket-like click click click of typewriter keys at the rewrite desk drew me, and I stood by to take his story to Lane: . \"Word of President Roosevelt's death struck Chicago late this afternoon with numbing suddenness. \"Within a few minutes after the bulletins came to The Daily News, the office switchboards were swamped with calls for verification. \"So great were the number of calls, that the lines became clogged and many queries could not be handled. \"Many of the callers spoke as if disbelieving the report -- as if it were some wildly spread rumor. \"The same kind of uncertainty was noticed in the faces of the crowds thronging homeward.   Word passed from one to another: . \"'Did you hear that?  Roosevelt is dead?  Is it true'?\" Cleveland's story delivered, I returned to the city desk to help with the calls.  Many, as he had mentioned, from people wanting to know whether it was true but some from reporters and beat men who'd been heading home, reporting the reaction where they were. A copyboy rushed around the room, dropping off copies of the first EXTRA -- the simple news in a 76-point-type headline: ROOSEVELT DEAD . Statements began coming in from local officials and civic leaders, a few phoned in but most from the City News Bureau, which served the Chicago newspapers with local news as the wire services did with national news.  I sorted through the multiple copies, separating them into ever-growing stacks. The second EXTRA was dropped off.  ROOSEVELT DEAD   With the subhead: Dies at 63 of Hemorrhage in Georgia . The last EXTRA had a three-column photo of Roosevelt, edged in black, a two-column of Truman and a story on the president's death and funeral plans. As the editors talked, I heard one ask, \"What kind of president do you think he'll make?\"  And O'Flaherty, director of the Daily News Foreign Service, said, \"If there's anything to the American system, the man will rise to the office.\" I've thought of that through the years as Truman has risen in the opinion of presidential historians.  The atom bomb.  The Marshall Plan.  The Berlin Airlift.  The Truman Doctrine.  Recognition of the state of Israel.  Desegregation of the armed services.  Ordering U.S. forces to oppose the invading forces when North Korea crossed the 38th Parallel and invaded South Korea, then organizing a United Nations army.  Firing Douglas MacArthur. I continued to sort the statements from officials.  Lane asked me to take one set down to Lloyd Lewis. The chief editorial writer had a corner office at the far end of the long office corridor.  I found him sitting in the dark, looking out the window at the Chicago skyline.  Sensing my presence, he said, \"I wonder what the world will be like without him.\" \"I don't know, sir.\"  In the dusk, the quiet, I suspect he didn't expect an answer, but I thought about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served in the White House for an unprecedented 12 years.  \"He's the only president I can remember.\" He turned, saw me in the doorway, a teenager in penny loafers, a cardigan sweater and a pleated plaid skirt, and said with a nod, \"Of course.\" I gave him the statements and updated him on the latest news.  \"The funeral train will bring his body up from Georgia ... to Washington, I mean.\" The next morning, I turned to the editorial page to see what he'd written. Lewis took his cue from Roosevelt's address to a joint session of the Congress following his trip to Yalta.  The headline: . \"It has been a long journey.  I trust you will agree it has been a fruitful one.\" Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted FDR's age in the Chicago Daily News subhead. He was 63."}

The defense and prosecution made closing arguments in the case on Monday. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahideen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted each other in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of 8-year-old bomb victim Martin Richard, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahideen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev, 21 years old, stands accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began on March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The prosecution on Monday played a graphic video of the scene of the bombing that showed a chaotic, bloody scene with injured people everywhere. A child's piercing cries are heard. It's the son of Rebekah Gregory, who lost her leg. Then, another photo is displayed. This time jurors see Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of little Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Bill Richard, Martin's father, who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"It was Tamerlan,\" defense attorney Clarke repeated during her closing argument Monday. \"In the past few weeks we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" she said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" But he was only following his brother, she insisted. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. The older brother, a 26-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has said. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-yeaer-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims: . Richard's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open and she bled out.\" Krystle Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officier for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto,\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston Marathon Terror Attack Fast Facts ."}

Authorities still don't know the fate of many of the passengers, including children, who were on the large ship bound from Libya to Europe that capsized Saturday night in the frigid waters of the Mediterranean Sea. That sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages. \"Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,\" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. \"They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else.\" A rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from Libya, and the number of potential victims is not clear. A Bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board. Previous estimates put the number around 700. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, said around 50 people had been saved. But the Italian Coast Guard said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" Federica Mogherini told CNN's \"The World Right Now with Hala Gorani.\" The EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days, along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said last week. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea -- 23,500 have landed in Italy and more than 12,000 in Greece, according to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. While those numbers sound high, they were even higher the previous year. In 2014, approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the Mediterranean, with most having to be rescued by the Italian Navy, Coast Guard or merchant ships, the UNCHR said. It is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea. On Monday, yet another boat sank off the Greek island of Rhodes, killing at least three people, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said. Of the 83 people reported on board, at least 57 survived. Those confirmed dead were a man, a woman and a child. The capsizing of the ship that departed from Libya marked the worst such disaster so far. As rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night, authorities say, migrants moved to one side, hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya, sending many passengers plunging into the sea. According to one Bangladeshi survivor, large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank. Smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel, the survivor told Italian authorities. \"Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,\" Muscat said. While the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters. It's \"genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,\" Muscat told CNN. \"A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,\" said Loris De Filippi, the president of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders. He compared the high number of deaths to \"figures from a war zone.\" De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. \"Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,\" he said. \"This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped.\" Save the Children similarly called on European officials to do more. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" the group's CEO Justin Forsyth said in a statement. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss. Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean come from sub-Saharan Africa, often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages. \"There is a well-oiled machine with the human traffickers, first by land and then by sea, and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to Europe at all costs,\" said Rome-based journalist Barbie Nadeau. The situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend isn't unusual, based on accounts of previous voyages. On old fishing boats, \"people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship,\" Nadeau said. \"Those are the cheaper tickets. People that want to be out on the upper deck, which is the prime space, pay a little more for that service.\" Traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ($6,450 to $8,600) per person for the dangerous voyage, she said. Italy's proximity to the North African coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent's migration crisis. \"We're swamped,\" Sandro Gozi, the Italian minister for European affairs, told French daily Le Monde. \"There's not even enough space in Sicily's cemeteries to bury the dead.\" An Italian search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum, was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year. But it ended in October because of budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean. The European Union's border control agency, Frontex, started its own mission in November, known as Triton, with a budget of less than a third of that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships. As anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent, European nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep. \"We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen,\" Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting \"a total absence\" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe. The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, said Sunday it was consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy to be adopted in mid-May. \"These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act,\" it said. But international groups say European governments are failing to do enough. Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, De Filippi said, because \"as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Hada Messia, Josh Levs and Catherine E.

How could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested? And what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital? Gray wavered in and out of a coma and died Sunday, one week after his arrest. It's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury. But Gray is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody. Here are several other cases: . Date of arrest: March 31, 2015 . Date of death: March 31, 2015 . What happened: . Police in Vineland, New Jersey, responded to a call of a disorderly person, and White was arrested and handcuffed. Police dispatch recordings include an officer saying White \"tried to grab my gun.\" One witness, Agustin Ayala, told the Vineland Daily Journal that White was resisting arrest. But two others told WCAU that police attacked White while he was already handcuffed. \"They punched him, stomped him, kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car,\" Ricardo Garcia told the station. \"The dog bit him on his face and around his body. There's no call for that. Once a man is handcuffed and unconscious, you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station.\" Witness Luis Martinez gave a similar account. \"The other cop let the dog out, and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time,\" Martinez told WCAU. \"He was on the floor, like he was knocked out.\" As White was taken to a hospital, he became unresponsive, NJ.com reported. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. The aftermath: . The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office has been investigating White's death, and officials have been waiting for the results of White's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death, NJ.com said. Two Vineland officers have been placed on administrative leave. And after Vineland police received criticism on its Facebook page about White's case, the department started hiding unfavorable comments, the Press of Atlantic City reported. An activist filed an Open Public Records Act request, saying the department's official Facebook page was a matter of public record. Vineland police later restored the critical comments on its page. Date of arrest: March 2, 2014 . Date of death: March 2, 2014 . What happened: . Sheriff's deputies in New Iberia, Louisiana, claimed White shot and killed himself in the back of a squad car -- even though White had been frisked and handcuffed. \"Short of him being Houdini or David Copperfield, it's not possible,\" White family attorney Carol Powell-Lexing said. The incident began when authorities were responding to a fight in a gas station parking lot. About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy saw White and stopped him, state police said. According to the service report from the Sheriff's Office, Cpl. Justin Ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight. He was told only that they were black, \"and one of the males mentioned having a gun,\" the report said. White consented to a pat-down, and Ortis found marijuana in his pocket. Attorney Benjamin Crump said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious. \"If you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana, wouldn't you feel a gun?\" he said. State police said once White arrived at the police station, he refused to get out of the patrol car. \"As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round, striking himself in the back,\" state police said. White was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The aftermath: . An autopsy concluded White's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest, not in the back, like police had said. The autopsy report also said White was \"reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over.\" State police have handed over their investigation to prosecutors, who said a decision won't be made until a federal civil rights investigation wraps up. Date of police encounter: July 5, 2011 . Date of death: July 10, 2011 . What happened: . Officers in Fullerton, California, were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars. Video of the incident showed Thomas, who was schizophrenic, slow to cooperate. Fullerton police Officer Manuel Ramos  then tells him: \"You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up.\" Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help. \"OK, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!\" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax. Toward the end of the beating, the video shows, Thomas cries out for his father: \"Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, Dad.\" By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood. The aftermath: . The Orange County coroner ruled Thomas' death a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Thomas' mother, Cathy Thomas, received a $1 million settlement from the city of Fullerton. Officer Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli was charged of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both pleaded not guilty. In 2014, a jury acquitted both Ramos and Cicinelli. Date of arrest: September 6, 2013 . Date of death: September 7, 2013 . What happened: . Azucena was arrested after running a red light and leading Los Angeles police on a chase. Over the next half hour, Azucena repeatedly said he had asthma and couldn't breathe, the Los Angeles Times reported. Officers continued ignoring him. \"Help me, help me, help me,\" he said, according to a report by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. \"I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Help me, please.\" \"You can breathe just fine,\" one sergeant told him, according to the Times. \"You can talk, so you can breathe.\" He didn't breathe for much longer. Azucena was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station's holding cell for booking and left him face-down on the floor, the Times reported. By the time paramedics arrived, Azucena's heart had stopped. The aftermath: . A coroner concluded that asthma probably killed Azucena and that his death was an accident. Last month, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously agreed to a $1.35 million settlement for Azucena's mother, the Times said. The investigation into the officers' actions is ongoing. Date of arrest: November 19, 2013 . Date of death: November 19, 2013 . What happened: . An officer in Durham, North Carolina, was taking Huerta to the police station for a second-degree trespassing violation. The Durham Police Department said the teen died from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of the squad car. Durham police Chief Jose Lopez said gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation \"found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer (Samuel) Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands.\" But Huerta's family, like Victor White's family in Louisiana, suspect foul play by police. The aftermath: . Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Durham to decry Huerta's death. Some carried banners that read, \"Fue Matado Por La Policia\" or \"Murdered By Police.\" A vigil for Huerta turned violent, with six people arrested. The police chief said that as a Hispanic, he had trouble believing the allegations among the Hispanic community that Durham police unfairly target Latinos. CNN's Eliott C.

But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston trial: What defense?"}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1965, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)The arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality. But it's unclear how Gray, who was arrested on a weapons charge April 12, suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later. Here are the big questions surrounding this controversial case: . What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore known for drugs. He \"gave up without the use of force,\"  Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said last week. An officer apparently took his Taser out and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it, Rodriguez said. And none of the six officers involved in the arrest described using force against the 25-year-old. Gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk, said Rodriguez, who described Gray as upset. \"And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,\" according to Rodriguez. Police have said Gray was not buckled in with a seat belt during the ride to a booking center. What we don't know: It's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest, and it's also unknown what, if anything, happened inside the van. What we know: Segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after Gray has been arrested and show officers dragging Gray, who is handcuffed, to a van. He can be heard screaming. \"He was dragged a bit,\" said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, \"but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van. And we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive.\" One woman who recorded a video of the arrest said she knew Gray. \"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" the woman said. \"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling.\" Surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking, police said. That was at 8:54 a.m. At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance for Gray. Police say Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. Rawlings-Blake and  Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis have said the arresting officers should have asked for medical attention immediately after Gray asked for it. What we don't know: It's unknown why Gray screamed, and the cell phone video doesn't capture the entire incident, start to end. And it's unclear why police didn't call for an ambulance sooner. What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers were suspended. Their names were released last week. The suspensions are standard procedure after an \"in-custody death,\" said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk. It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved, he said. They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012. Three of the six responding officers were on bicycles when they initially approached Gray, according to Kowalczyk. Another officer joined the arrest after it was initiated, while one more drove the police van, the police spokesman said. What we don't know: The officers say they didn't use force against Gray, but that's not certain. In fact, details about what each of the officers specifically did have not been released. What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields. In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver. Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved. Gray was paroled on June 30, 2011. On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison, Shields said, reasoning that  whatever Gray allegedly did, it \"was something minor.\" Gray did return to prison in May 2013 for drug possession, serving a month behind bars before his release in June. What we don't know: It's not known whether Gray's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest, or his death. What we know: Protesters have taken to the streets of Baltimore daily since two days after Gray's death, rallying around his family.  On the first night, they marched to a local police station chanting \"No justice! No peace!\" On another occasion they marched to City Hall. The demonstrations have been peaceful on most nights, but on Monday rioters damaged buildings and destroyed police vehicles. Looters stole goods from several stores. Some groups of people intervened, keeping additional looters out of trashed businesses. The demonstrators are pushing to get answers about Gray's death and for \"justice,\" as they define it. Similar protests were held in Ferguson, Missouri, following Michael Brown's death and in New York, after the death of Eric Garner. Other small protests have sprung up in other cities in the past week. \"Mr. Gray's family deserves justice,\" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week. \"And our community deserves an opportunity to heal, to get better, and to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again. The mayor said that any confirmed information will be promptly relayed to the public. \"I want people to understand that I have no interest in hiding information, holding back information,\" Rawlings-Blake said. Some protesters have called for the officers to be arrested and charged. One organizer called for Police Commissioner Anthony Batts to resign. What we don't know: There's no guarantee protesters will get the kind of definitive answers they want about how and why Gray died. What we know: Baltimore police are looking into Gray's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by Friday. The probe, like the suspensions of the six police officers, is standard whenever someone dies while in custody. The police's findings will go to the state's attorney's office, where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed. Batts said recently that a medical examiner had some initial findings, but needed to get back the results of toxicology reports, which could take weeks. Rawlings-Blake asked for an outside investigation, given the city's dark history of police misconduct. The U.S. Justice Department, which announced a collaborative reform initiative with Baltimore police in October in light of its past problems, is looking into the Gray case, a spokesman said last week. The point of that federal investigation will be to gauge whether a prosecutable civil rights violation may have occurred. What we don't know: What information that investigators, both local and federal, will turn up and when. It is also unclear if the medical examiner called in spinal experts to view the evidence, a possibility Batts raised at a news conference. What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. The Gray family attorney called the allegation a \"sideshow.\" Gray was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" attorney William Murphy told CNN. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said. The court documents also say that Gray \"fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" \"The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,\" the documents say. \"The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring-assisted, one-hand-operated knife.\" Maryland law makes it illegal to \"wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind\" -- including switchblades -- \"concealed on or about the person.\" What we don't know: It's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime, said Rawlings-Blake. \"It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,\" she said. CNN's  AnneClaire Stapleton, Stephanie Gallman, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Dana Ford and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report."}

Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. \"This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,\" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" the officer writes that Slager said. \"He took my Taser.\" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,\" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. \"I ... thought about erasing the video,\" Santana told MSNBC's \"All in With Chris Hayes\" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. \"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger.\" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events . Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,\" he told Holt. \"But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston . The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father,\" she said. \"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son.\" Who was Walter Scott?

And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. \"It's been a really rough day,\" Susan Reiter told CNN. \"Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive.\" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. \"Huge disaster,\" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. \"Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.\" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that \"a huge avalanche swept over basecamp\" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. \"On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,\" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. \"This also makes it more difficult to search for people.\" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. \"The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,\" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. \"Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal.\" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an \"adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer.\" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. \"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,\" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,\" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, \"whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation.\" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. \"On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,\" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, \"which is very dangerous anyway,\" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, \"the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves.\" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. \"It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,\" he said. \"I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. \"It's been a bad few years on Everest,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength.\" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, \"Into Thin Air.\" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. \"This is our job,\" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost \"friends in brothers\" in the 2014 avalanche. \"So there is always a risk of death.\" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of \"The Seven Summits\" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 \"because it didn't feel right\" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? \"You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,\" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. \"But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back.\" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors . CNN's Katia Hetter, Jessica King and Carma Hassan contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1903, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. \"I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,\" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the \"golden boy,\" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. \"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,\" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, \"I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting.\" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. \"If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,\" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. \"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,\" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with \"Nfl.\" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became \"angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize.\" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, \"Yo, what's up now,\" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

The girl, Katie Donovan, read that the boy, Dalton Prager, was very sick.  \"If you ever need a friend to talk to, you can reach out to me,\" she wrote. \"Sorry, but do I know you?\" he responded. No, you don't, Katie wrote back, and told Dalton a bit about herself. Like him, she was 18, and \"my breathing is pretty crappy and I see you are in the hospital. I'm sorry. I know it sucks!...But you just gotta stay strong.\" Messages between the two flew back and forth. They realized they were falling in love. For most other couples, the next step would be to meet in person. But for Katie and Dalton, that was complicated -- and dangerous. Cystic fibrosis patients shouldn't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs. Dr. Michael Anstead at the University of Kentucky, Katie's pulmonologist since she was a little girl, had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other CF patients were a bad idea. In their online conversations, one of the first things Dalton told Katie about himself was that he had Burkholderia cepacia, a horribly dangerous infection for people with CF. \"I was like, 'Hi, I'm Dalton from Missouri and I have Burkholderia cepacia,' because it's such a big deal in the CF community,\" he remembers. \"I left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her.\" Katie listened to her heart, even if it might hurt her lungs. She asked Dalton to come visit her in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. \"I told Dalton I'd rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years,\" Katie says. \"That was definitely something I had to think about, but when you have those feelings, you just know.\" So on August 28, 2009, Dalton drove more than six hours from St. Charles, Missouri, to Katie's hometown in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where they'd arranged to meet at the Dairy Queen. At 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- Katie got out of her car and saw Dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses. \"My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello,\" she remembers. \"I'm usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right.\" Katie took Dalton and his mother, Renee, who'd made the trip with him, to have dinner with her and her parents, Debbie and John Donovan. Later the young couple drove around Flemingsburg, and Dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday, which was two days before. Their health quickly deteriorated, and within months, the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time. Too ill to work, Dalton quit his job at his family's auto repair shop, and Katie quit hers as a store clerk. In August, 2014, the couple entered the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center together to wait for new lungs. Dalton's came first, and on November 17, he had his transplant. Despite his Burkholderia cepacia, which makes transplants more complicated, it was a success. \"I was so thrilled. I was so happy for him,\" Katie says. The month after Dalton's surgery, UPMC discharged Katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while. When she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital, but  UPMC informed her she'd used up her supply of Medicare days and wouldn't accept her. Medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- wouldn't pay for another hospitalization until Katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days. But Katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days, much less sixty. So Katie relied on Medicaid, public insurance that was supplied by her home state of Kentucky. She was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, where she was cared for by Anstead, her beloved pulmonologist. But then, another hurdle. Anstead explained that most lung transplant centers, including the two in Kentucky, don't do transplants on patients with Burkholderia cepacia, referring them to larger centers like UPMC that have more experience with such complicated cases. Katie and Dalton, now 24 and 23, were desperate. Her doctors predicted she wouldn't live a year without new lungs. Going on her husband's private insurance wasn't an option, since Dalton is on his father's policy. In February, Anstead wrote a letter to Medicaid, pleading with them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care at UPMC, even though it was out of state. Kentucky Medicaid denied his plea, and that's when the squabbling began. In a statement to CNN, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services pointed the finger at UPMC, saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. \"Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,\" wrote the spokeswoman, Gwenda Bond. \"Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.\" UPMC counters that Kentucky Medicaid told them that if they want to care for Katie, they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. While UPMC spokeswoman Wendy Zellner didn't elaborate, a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state Medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low. Asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid is \"an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state Medicaid programs,\" Zellner wrote. \"UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation.\" Today, Katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed, hoping that the three parties -- Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs. \"I feel like they're putting a dollar sign on my life,\" she says. \"I don't want to die because of money. That's stupid. Nobody should have to do that.\" If Katie doesn't get her transplant, not only will she die, but she'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection, which could be deadly for him as he's on drugs to suppress his immune system. As a result of inquiries from CNN, on Wednesday Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services arranged for a caseworker to call Katie at the hospital. But it didn't go very well. Katie says the caller, who identified herself as Pat Pierorazio, was \"rude, mean, and angry.\" \"She said someone had told her to call me, and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me,\" she says. Katie says the Medicare representative told her she would look into her situation. In a statement, Albright with CMS wrote to CNN: \"We are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs. CMS is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible.\" Caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance, Katie tries to stay strong, just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first Facebook conversation. Skyping with Dalton helps, and raising money on their Facebook page keeps her mind busy. And she's always thinking about their \"after transplant bucket list,\" which they keep in a safe in their house so it won't be destroyed by fire or flood. On the list: Drive through every state. Learn another language and visit a country where they speak it. Write a book together about their love story. They have simpler dreams as well. Like going grocery shopping together, or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television. And this is their biggest goal: . \"I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug. That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary,\" she says. Wednesday afternoon, there were signs of hope. Zeller, the UPMC spokeswoman, sent an email to CNN. \"Ky Medicaid has reached out to us to talk. So stay tuned,\" she wrote. Katie and Dalton were glad to hear it. \"I don't care what I have to do to get her lungs,\" Dalton said. \"I will just keep trying until there's nothing left to try.\""}

The video is being dissected frame by frame by authorities and media outlets, all in an effort to reconstruct what exactly happened between North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager, a five-year employee of that force, and Walter Scott, 50. Slager, 33, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder after firing eight shots at Scott, killing him. Slager is also now \"terminated\" from the force, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said Wednesday. Added police Chief Eddie Driggers on Wednesday: \"I watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw and I have not watched it since.\" Both Scott and Slager had once served in the U.S. Coast Guard, with Scott's service occurring 1984-86 and Slager's 2003-09. Scott was a father of four. Slager is a father to two stepchildren, and his wife is eight months' pregnant. Here's what we know of the fatal shooting: . Slager pulled Scott over at 9:33 a.m. Saturday for a broken taillight, according to authorities. Chief Driggers described the incident as \"traffic stop of an individual who had a minor infraction on his vehicle, a brake light being out.\" A foot chase then occurred, a police report said. The video, taken by a passer-by, doesn't show any vehicle. Rather, Slager and Scott are on a path or roadway in a parklike setting bordered partly by a chain-link fence. The video was shot over and through the fence. \"The officer said that Walter ran from the vehicle during the traffic stop,\" Scott family attorney L. Chris Stewart said. According to the police report, Scott did not comply with the officer's demands. Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, said his brother had trouble with child support and had an outstanding warrant against him, but that his sibling wasn't prone to violence. \"That very well could have been the reason (for running from police), not to be arrested for the warrant that was on him for child support,\" Anthony Scott said. The video begins by showing a second or two of an apparent struggle between the officer and suspect. The officer contended he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take that weapon, authorities said. But when Anthony Scott saw the video, he was convinced the officer lied, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" The video shows Walter Scott running away, with his back to the officer. As he does so, two objects fall. One falls behind the officer. And the other falls between the two men. To Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer to escape more of the Taser. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot. No one would have thought that,\" Scott said. As Walter Scott runs away, the officer pulls his service pistol and fires eight times, the video shows. As the shots are being fired, Scott keeps running away from the officer, the video shows. Scott then falls. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether it is the Taser. It's also unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser, or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Immediately after Scott was shot, according to the video, someone yells, \"Put your hands behind your back!\" Scott, motionless and face-down on the ground, is handcuffed. It was Slager who apparently called police dispatch. \"226 to dispatch, shots fired, subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,\" Slager told the dispatcher, according to a transcript provide by Broadcastify.com. The dispatcher notes that the subject is down at 9:38 a.m., according to the transcript. About 90 seconds after saying that Scott \"grabbed\" his Taser, the officer describes Scott as unresponsive and having wounds to the chest, right thigh and buttocks, according to the transcript. The location of the shooting is behind a pawn shop, the officer tells the dispatcher. A police report identified that shop as Mega Pawn. According to CNN affiliate WCIV-TV in Charleston, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. However, Aylor later told CNN that he was no longer representing the officer. \"Today, I withdrew my representation of Michael Slager. This is a terrible tragedy that has impacted our community,\" Aylor said in a statement. Later, Anthony Scott's mother calls him and says his brother was Tasered at a traffic stop. Anthony Scott goes to the scene and finds it curious to see police tape around his brother's vehicle and the officer's vehicle. He asks officers what happened. No one replies. Then Anthony Scott's nephew tells him that \"my brother is gone,\" Anthony Scott said. \"And at that, I lost it,\" Anthony Scott said. An officer also apprises him later of what happened. Anthony Scott is shown the video for the first time on Sunday. \"My reaction to it was that we have to get ahold of the video and that this was key evidence, key evidence in the case,\" Anthony Scott said. \"We had to get it. The country had to see this.\" He felt \"a little bit of anger and happy at the same time,\" the brother said. \"Based on what the video was showing, it was discrediting what the officer had initially stated,\" Anthony Scott said. The nation did indeed see the video -- and was stunned by its revelations. Authorities saw it, too. Slager was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, WCIV reported. \"I have two stepchildren and one on the way,\" Slager told a magistrate through video conferencing. If found guilty of murder, Slager could face up to life in prison or death. The city of North Charleston will continue to cover the insurance for the pregnancy of Slager's wife, the mayor said. An autopsy on Scott, performed Sunday, \"revealed that Mr. Scott sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and the manner of death was ruled 'Homicide,' \" Charleston County Coroner Rae H. Wooten said Wednesday. Anthony Scott said Wednesday that his brother was \"shot in the back four times.\" The autopsy findings support family's claims that the police used excessive use -- even if the video never existed, Anthony Scott said. \"Eventually we would have gotten to this point, but not this fast,\" Anthony Scott said. \"There is absolutely no way to cover that up,\" he added about the gunshot wounds to the back. North Charleston police aren't involved in the investigation into the shooting and have turned the matter over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The FBI is also investigating. Anthony Scott and family attorney Stewart believe the object that Officer Slager relocated at the crime scene is the Taser, they said. Stewart also accused the officer of trying to plant evidence by moving the Taser and placing it close to Walter Scott's body. A slow-motion analysis of the tape, along with highlights of key moments, supports the family's step-by-step interpretation of the officer's actions, including the handling of the Taser, the attorney alleged. \"He drops the Taser, kills Mr. Scott, walks all the way back, picks something up off the ground from where he was taking the shots, comes back to the body, waits a second, drops it on the ground, and then pretends to be recovering it and putting it back on his holster,\" Stewart said, referring to the Taser. \"Why we believe that is because it fits in line with his initial report of what happened out there. I mean he just committed a murder. He needed something, a justifiable reason to use lethal force, and that's the only thing he could think of,\" Stewart said. Neither Officer Slager or his attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday. Authorities aren't commenting on the details of the case while it's under investigation.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1961, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Dan Swangard knows what death looks like. As a physician, he has seen patients die in hospitals, hooked to morphine drips and overcome with anxiety. He has watched dying drag on for weeks or months as terrified relatives stand by helplessly. Recently, however, his thoughts about how seriously ill people die have become personal. Swangard was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of metastatic cancer. To remove the cancer, surgeons took out parts of his pancreas and liver, as well as his entire spleen and gallbladder. The operation was successful but Swangard, 48, knows there's a strong chance the disease will return. And if he gets to a point where there's nothing more medicine can do, he wants to be able to control when and how his life ends. \"It's very real for me,\" said Swangard, who lives in Bolinas, Calif. \"This could be my own issue a year from now.\" That's one of the reasons Swangard joined a California lawsuit last month seeking to let doctors prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who want to hasten death. If he were given only months to live, Swangard said, he can't say for certain whether he would take them. \"But I want to be able to make that choice,\" he said. The right-to-die movement has gained renewed momentum in California and around the nation following the highly publicized death of an East Bay woman with brain cancer. Brittany Maynard, 29, moved to Oregon to take advantage of its \"Death with Dignity\" law and died in November after taking a fatal dose of barbiturates prescribed by her doctor. The California lawsuit asks the court to protect physicians from liability if they prescribe lethal medications to patients who are both terminally ill and mentally competent to decide their fate. The lawsuit argues that while it is against the law in California for anyone to assist in another's suicide, these cases are not suicides. Rather, the suit argues, they are choices by a dying person on how his or her life should end and decisions about one's own body protected under the state constitution. Separately, two California state senators have proposed a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to certain terminally ill adults. Three states -- Oregon, Washington and Vermont -- already have laws allowing physician-assisted deaths. Courts in New Mexico and Montana also have ruled that aid in dying is legal, and a suit was also recently filed in New York. Legislation is pending in several other states. Kathryn Tucker, an attorney on several of the court cases, is also spearheading the California lawsuit. This time, she and her legal team decided to include among the plaintiffs two doctors with life-threatening illnesses, Swangard and a retired San Francisco obstetrician. Physicians \"have a very deep and broad understanding about what the journey to death can be like,\" said Tucker, executive director of the Disability Rights Legal Center. \"The curtain is pulled back. For lay people, death is much more mysterious.\" Historically, doctors have been some of the most vocal critics of assisted suicide, also called aid-in-dying. The American Medical Association still says that \"physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.\" Similarly, though it hasn't taken a position on currently proposed legislation, the California Medical Association has said that helping patients die conflicts with doctors' commitment to do no harm. \"It is the physicians' job to take care of the patient and that is amplified when that patient is most sick,\" said spokeswoman Molly Weedn. But a recent survey of 21,000 doctors in the U.S. and Europe shows views may be shifting. According to Medscape, the organization that did the survey, 54 percent of American doctors support assisted suicide, up from 46 percent four years earlier. Swangard is among those who believe that taking care of patients means letting them choose how their lives should end. That's not the same as killing patients or facilitating suicide, he said. Swangard completed his medical residency in San Francisco in the middle of the AIDS crisis; young men were dying all around him. Throughout his career as an internal medicine doctor, a hospice volunteer and now an anesthesiologist, he has become frustrated with how the medical system handles death. Doctors spend so much time trying to extend life that few focus on what patients want in their last days, he said. \"I don't think we know how to die,\" he said. \"We fight tooth and nail to keep that from happening.\" Swangard's own illness was discovered in early 2013 during a long overdue check-up. He hadn't been worried about his health -- he was obsessed with fitness, swimming regularly and seeing a trainer twice a week. But when the doctor pressed on Swangard's stomach, he felt a mango-sized mass. He had a visceral feeling, he said, \"something bad was happening.\" Within a week, a surgeon found a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas and metastasis in the liver. It was the same cancer that took Steve Jobs' life -- one that doesn't generally respond to chemotherapy or radiation. \"My fears became real,\" he said. The doctors told him they believed they got all the cancerous cells. But Swangard was tormented by questions: Am I going to be alive in a year? Is my cancer going to come back? \"I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't exercising, I was marinating in my own sadness and fear of what this all meant,\" he said. \"I thought, 'This is going to kill me.'\" Since his diagnosis, Swangard said he has had a greater understanding of his patients' struggles. Occasionally, he holds their hands and tells them he has been where they are. Earlier this year, a physician friend asked him if he'd be willing to join the California case. Swangard didn't hesitate. He didn't go into medicine to help dying people linger and wants to help change that approach — for his patients and for himself. When he dies, Swangard said, he wants to be surrounded by people he loves. He doesn't want to be in a drug-induced haze, nor consumed by worry about what's next. He wants to be able to say goodbye. \"It is a little bit of a blessing to know how I might die,\" he said. \"I don't think a lot of patients have insight into what to expect.\" These days, he wears a Buddhist prayer bracelet, a reminder to focus on the present. He cut his work hours, swims as often as he can and meditates regularly. At home, he stares out at the ocean, often watching dolphins pass by. He makes every effort to stay calm and healthy. He is in remission but he knows that what happens with the cancer is largely outside his control. An MRI last year showed a small lesion in his liver, which doctors are watching closely. \"It's this big unknown,\" he said. Dr. Robert Liner, a fellow plaintiff who only recently met Swangard, lives with the same uncertainty. On his 69th birthday in May 2013, the retired obstetrician had a bad cough. He felt tired and short of breath. His wife took him to the hospital, where doctors discovered malignant masses on his kidneys — advanced-stage lymphoma. After radiation and chemotherapy, the tumors shrank. He also is in remission. But if the cancer comes back, he said, \"the prospects are not going to be good.\" He often thinks of a former patient, a 25-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer. She wanted to die while she still was able to communicate. Liner wasn't able to help ease her death because the law wouldn't let him. \"I felt like I'd failed her,\" he said. Years before his diagnosis, Liner, now 70, became involved with Compassion & Choices, an organization that promotes aid-in-dying. He has a shelf of books in his San Francisco home devoted to the subject: Being Mortal, Dying Right, Knocking on Heaven's Door. He keeps a stack of notecards with quotes about the end of life, which he often recites in speeches to church groups or senior centers. One reads, \"The best preparation for death is a life well-lived.\" He believes having medication to hasten death helps terminally ill people live fully in their last weeks or months without being immobilized by fear. \"If you are riddled with anxiety, you are not free to concentrate on what's most meaningful to you,\" he said. Like Swangard, Liner doesn't know if he would take the medication. He recently married the woman he calls his \"beloved\" and said he has lots of plans for his retirement years, including writing a screenplay and improving his piano playing. \"My wife says I'd be hanging on to life by my fingernails,\" he said. But that decision should be his to make, with his family and his doctor, he said. \"I want the comfort of knowing it's up to me when enough is enough,\" he said.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1957, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)The investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's motive, but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Germany, said Monday. Investigators have not found any writings or conversations where Lubitz shared his motives or confessed to any plans, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. However, medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy. This was before he ever got his pilot's license, Kumpa said. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. It is believed that Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane Tuesday into the French Alps, killing all 150 on board. The prosecutor's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming Lubitz unfit to fly, though there were no physical illnesses found. In short, investigators in Germany and France are not yet ruling anything out. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. He had stated working as a commercial pilot in 2013, Lufthansa said. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. It's unknown if Lubitz mentioned his problems on a form that asks yes-or-no questions about physical and mental illness, suicide attempts and medications. European pilots must fill out the form to be recertified. Federal aviation authorities, not the airline, issue the form. The form is privileged information and Lufthansa never sees a pilot's completed form, said an airline spokesperson. The airline would only get a \"clear to fly\" notice from the aviation doctors alerting the airline that a pilot has completed recertification. Lubitz had visited an eye doctor because of vision problems, a European government official familiar with the investigation told CNN. The pilot complained he was not seeing as he should, but the doctor told him the cause was psychosomatic, the official said. In part because of this, the doctor deemed Lubitz unfit for flying. Lubitz told a different doctor --  a neuropsychologist -- that he was too stressed with work, the European official said. The dates of these visits are unclear, but they could have been earlier this year. The official said he is not aware of any suicidal tendencies reported by Lubitz to the doctors, but that investigators believe he was suicidal. Airline officials have said that if Lubitz went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. The note, which was \"slashed,\" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, Kumpa said Friday. Britain's most senior psychiatrist, Sir Simon Wessely, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that when a pilot is \"acutely depressed or suffering from really any physical illness\" that impairs abilities, they cannot fly an aircraft safely. \"We don't let pilots fly with depression ... because they're impaired in concentration, memory and attention, which isn't good for a pilot,\" said Wessely, who is president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army. One of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge from the crash so far comes from the cockpit voice recorder. The sounds recorded on the recorder, known as a \"black box,\" firms up a theory by investigators that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. \"For God's sake, open the door!\" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. CNN cannot independently verify the information, which Bild says is based on 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder. According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz told him he could go anytime. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. Once that's finished, Lubitz again told the captain he \"can go anytime.\" There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, \"You can take over.\" At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the \"sink rate,\" Bild reported. Next comes the banging. Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says, \"Terrain -- pull up!\" \"Open the damn door!\" the pilot says. It's 10:38 a.m., and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. Screams can be heard one final time. France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency was \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak to Bild. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere \"voyeurism.\" Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. About 150 German investigators -- some specializing in homicide cases and others in identifying remains -- are in the French Alps at the site of the crash, Dusseldorf police said Monday. Meanwhile, police continue to examine evidence collected from the apartment of Lubitz and from his parents' home, police said. French investigators at the crash site said they are optimistic they will be able to identify most of the passengers but added that \"it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash.\" Of the 150 passengers, 78 had been identified through DNA, Lt. Col.  Jean-Marc Menichini told CNN. Weather conditions slowed the rescue work Monday, Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie unit said. A new path under construction to the crash site will reduce the time it takes to reach the area, he said. Le Vernet Mayor Francois Balique told CNN the path was within 100 meters of being finished. He commissioned a backhoe to build the path, he said. \"I felt the family members wanted this and they asked me to get them as close as possible, as if every meter mattered to them,\" he said. The path will allow all-terrain vehicles to reach the site with fewer risks than with helicopter transfers. Family members of those aboard Flight 9525, meanwhile, are making the grim pilgrimage to the crash site. A total of 325 people have so far traveled to the site, Germanwings Chief Operating Officer Oliver Wagner said Monday at a news conference. He detailed what the airline is doing to support relatives of the victims. CNN's Pamela Brown, Pamela Boykoff, Antonia Mortensen, Sandrine Amiel, Frederik Pleitgen, Karl Penhaul and Margot Haddad contributed to this report."}

His Tuscan Sun Festival opens Saturday in Cortona, Italy. An all-new Singapore Sun Festival opens October 18. And a secret known to missionaries everywhere is clearly in sway at the Festival del Sole in Napa Valley, which has just concluded its second year: Bonding with the locals. With quick fervor, local leaders, the hospitality industry and those all-important vintners of Napa have embraced their festival. When symphony conductor Stéphane Denève mentioned last year that he'd like to get married there, Tatiana and Gerret Copeland of the Bouchaine wine estate threw the ceremony for them in the vineyards.   See images from a maestro's marriage in the vineyards of Napa during this year's Festival del Sole » . \"It's a mission in my life to have more and more people enjoy and love the arts,\" Wissman says in an interview sandwiched between Denève's presentation of the Grieg piano concerto and Prokofiev's \"Romeo and Juliet\" suite with the Russian National Orchestra.  Watch highlights and comments from Barrett Wissman and the artists of Festival del Sole » . \"One of the reasons that we have these festivals -- engage local communities and have music, literature, art, film, cuisine, wine, all these subjects -- is we attract different people who like each one. And then get them to like something else. Today, our goal in education in the arts is to get everybody involved.\" Wissman is uniquely positioned to \"get everybody involved.\" More than a priest or even a bishop in this arts-mission field, he's a cardinal in the industry, the chairman of IMG Artists, a major player in world artists' representation. IMG's roster includes violinists Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman, mezzo-soprano Fredericka von Stade, flutist James Galway, guitarist Christopher Parkening, the Joffrey Ballet and composer Jay Greenberg, among many others. Wissman has just announced a new managing director for IMG in North and South America, Elizabeth Sobol. She is, herself, a co-producer of a new festival in Boca Raton, Florida, and architect of a highly publicized new joint venture for IMG with Gorfaine-Schwartz, the agency representing trumpeter-composer Chris Botti, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, singer-songwriter James Taylor and Hollywood film composer John Williams. No matter how far-flung the festivals and events, Wissman stays near his roots. \"I'm a pianist,\" he says, \"a concert pianist. I still play, I play from time to time in the festivals. So I'm a musician, I come from the arts.\" In the case of Napa's Festival del Sole, Wissman has a co-founder, San Francisco-based attorney Richard Walker, who has a specialization in artists' management.  Watch an audio slide show in which Richard Walker talks about the atmosphere of the festival » . Having worked with Mikhail Pletnev's Russian National Orchestra, Walker says, since its inception in 1990 as the first symphonic entity founded after the Soviet Union's collapse, he emphasizes the stylistic range demanded in festival work. And Walker echoes Wissman's interest in making these festivals oases in the itinerant lives of world-traveling artists. \"The events that surround the musical performances,\" Walker says, \"are attended by the artists, themselves -- a time of camaraderie for them because they see each other and spend time enjoying each other's company.\" As if on cue, two world-class pianists, Polish-Hungarian Piotr Anderszewski and French-born Jean-Yves Thibaudet, are seated at the same table at a gala post-concert dinner held by Far Niente wine estate on a cloudless night in a circular arbor crowded with honeysuckle. Thibaudet jumps up at one point to accompany violinist Bell in Manuel Ponce's \"Estrellita,\" watched by composer Marco Tutino and cellist Nina Kotova. Read about Joshua Bell's recent win of the $75,000 Fisher Prize . \"We are located in a wonderful hotel,\" says conductor Denève, the newlywed whose base of operations is Glasgow where he is music director of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. \"Wonderful swimming pool, actually it's a great way to socialize and get to know more and more the fellow artists because usually you are engaged and just have one or two nights.\" Thibaudet places a similar premium on these festivals' sense of community for artists. \"When we have concerts,\" he says, \"we just come into town, we play and we leave.  Usually there won't be any other soloists, there's only you. So we never get to meet each other during the year.\" And it appears that the Napa community couldn't be happier than to find these major concert and recording artists \"working the valley.\" In a kind of vine-roots, if not grassroots, effort, the wineries have jumped with endearing eagerness into what Walker terms a \"friendly competition\" for whose after-concert gala can be the most opulent. They lay on rich dinners set at starlit tables, some by glowing pools, others on cricket-chirpy hilltops and still others under chandeliers hung high in some of the most honored wine-making facilities in the country. One of the venues for the festival this year has been the Medieval-looking Castello di Amorosa, another the renovated Lincoln Theatre in Yountville. Wineries participating in special events around an intensely proud sponsorship of the festival have included Far Niente, the Copelands' Bouchaine Vineyards, Darioush Winery, Clos Pegase, Robert Mondavi Winery, Peju Province Winery, Pine Ridge Winery  and St. Supéry Vineyards and Winery. Many of these are festival-funding partners, joined by Domaine Chandon, Blackbird Vineyards, Dalla Valle Vineyards, Plumpjack Winery, Folio Winemakers' Studio, Gargiulo Vineyards, Swanson Vineyards and COPIA, a nonprofit center of wine-making culture in the valley. The vintners, themselves, seem to enjoy the chance to mingle in the common interest of the festival and in the company of these artists they seem to be tying onto their hearts like vine tendrils in their fields. Margrit Mondavi is a welcome guest one evening at Far Niente, as are Tatiana and Gerret Copeland of the Bouchaine house. Florence's Maria Manetti Farrow, whose ranging Villa Mille Rose is an influential olive oil estate, seems to be everyone's fondest table mate and every artist's favorite dinner companion. Resort partners include Auberge du Soleil, Calistoga Ranch, Solage Calistoga, the Carneros Inn and Silverado Resort. Walker, in fact, estimates that the Napa festival -- which with Cortona and Singapore is produced by the nonprofit Del Sole Foundation for the Arts and Humanities -- could cost as much as $10 million to stage, if the many in-kind services provided by hoteliers, wineries and others were totaled in cash. The \"rehearsals\" for all this, if you will, took place in Cortona, where Wissman and Charles Letourneau, executive producer, have staged several years of festival events in what Wissman likes to call \"a magical, Fellini-esque feel.\" When he looked for a spot in the United States to base a sister festival, \"Napa was the perfect place,\" close to the metropolitan pace of San Francisco but removed enough to shelter artists and audiences in peace. Wissman looks across a long, candlelit table amid shadowy great barrels of Bouchaine wine. French conductor Denève has Tatiana Copeland's dinner guests in stitches with his tale of how he proposed to his new wife on the glass floor high atop the Canada's National Tower in Toronto -- \"My God, it was frightening!\" \"One has to lead,\" says Wissman, Cortona's Saturday opening already occupying his thoughts.  \"When doing something important. No matter what your job is, no matter what your work is, you have to lead.\" E-mail to a friend . Official sponsors of the 2007 Festival de Sole include Auberge Resorts, Bouchaine Vineyards, Boucheron, Grove Street Winery/Peter Paul Wines, Napa Valley Vintners and XOJet.\n\n**News 2**:\n(REAL SIMPLE) -- With soaring gas prices and travel costs, the cheapest route to whisk yourself away this summer is through a good book.

He was 76. John Updike won many literary awards. His books, such as \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" were also best-sellers. Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer. He lived in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. \"He was one of our greatest writers, and he will be sorely missed,\" said Nicholas Latimer, vice president of publicity at Updike's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Updike was a rarity among American writers: a much-esteemed, prize-winning author whose books -- including \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960), \"Couples\" (1968), \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984) and \"Terrorist\" (2006) -- were also best-sellers. Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice: for \"Rabbit Is Rich\" (1981) and its successor, \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1991). iReport: Share your tributes to John Updike . The \"Rabbit\" series, about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike's hometown of Shillington, Pennsylvania, spanned four novels, a novella and four decades. In the books -- which also included 1971's \"Rabbit Redux\" and a 2001 novella, \"Rabbit Remembered\" -- onetime basketball star Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom negotiates marriage, divorce, wealth and health problems, never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life. \"Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection, but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood, and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking,\" wrote Time's Lev Grossman in naming \"Rabbit, Run\" to Time's \"All-Time 100 Novels\" list. Updike was incredibly prolific, penning essays, reviews, short stories, poetry and memoirs. His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker, including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams' final game, \"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu.\" \"No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John,\" said David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, in a statement. \"Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine, loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young. \"We adored him,\"  Remnick continued. \"He was, for so long, the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him.\" The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years, including 327 book reviews, 170 short stories and 154 poems. He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts. \"John Updike's place among America's literary greats is forever secure, as is his special place in every Red Sox fan's heart for his magnificent 'Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,' \" Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement. \"We honor his memory and his contributions, and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own.\" Updike never won a Nobel Prize, but one of his characters, Henry Bech, received one in \"Bech at Bay\" (1998). His works, particularly given their sexual content, could be as divisive as they were poetic. Many critics accused him of misogyny, and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream. \"It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book,\" the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001. But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers, the cover of Time magazine (for 1968's \"Couples\") and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain's Literary Review. He was criticized by Norman Mailer, hailed by fellow author (and Updike obsessive) Nicholson Baker in \"U and I\" and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a \"Simpsons\" episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book. \"[I] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield,\" Updike said, noting that the hardest part of his performance was \"producing a chuckle.\" John Hoyer Updike was born March 18, 1932, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Shillington. From an early age he took to reading and writing, and earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where he headed the Harvard Lampoon. Upon graduation, he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England. By the time he was 23, he had been offered a position at The New Yorker, which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years. Updike's first novel, \"The Poorhouse Fair,\" came out in 1959. The next year, in \"Rabbit, Run,\" he introduced Angstrom, who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction. When introduced, Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife, the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life. Over the course of the \"Rabbit\" books, the character would routinely infuriate his spouse, mistresses and offspring, try to make things right, and never quite succeed. His attitude didn't help. \"Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who has the brains. God maybe,\" the character said in \"Rabbit, Run.\" \"Rabbit, Run\" was successful, as were Updike's other '60s books, including \"The Centaur\" (1963), which featured a teacher much like Updike's father, and the short story collection \"The Music School\" (1966). But it was \"Couples\" that made Updike a household name. The book, about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts, became a No. 1 best-seller. Updike's interests ranged widely. He wrote about an African state in \"The Coup\" (1978). He discussed the relationship between science and religion in \"Roger's Version\" (1986). He revisited \"Hamlet\" in \"Gertrude and Claudius\" (2000). And he created a group of promiscuous witches in \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984), which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil. Though Updike's work routinely sold well, he was painfully aware of the decline of what's come to be called \"literary fiction.\" In a 2000 interview with Salon, he lamented its difficulties. \"When I was a boy, the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher's shelf. I mean, Steinbeck, Hemingway, some Faulkner. Faulkner actually had, considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are, quite a middle-class readership,\" he said. \"But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent. You don't feel that now.\" And yet, Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word, and the pleasure brought by jotting, tuning, refining -- creating -- a new story, even as the years drifted by. \"An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while,\" he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year. \"The pleasures, for him, of book-making ... remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best.\" Updike's most recent novel, \"The Widows of Eastwick,\" came out in 2008. A collection of stories, \"My Father's Tears and Other Stories,\" is due out later this year."}

In 2004, David Goldman dropped off his wife, Bruna, and then-4-year-old son, Sean, at the airport for a two-week vacation in Brazil. Shortly after she arrived in her native country, Bruna told David she wanted a divorce and planned to stay in Brazil with their son.

Goldman thought he was getting his son back, but a Brazilian family court judge granted custody of Sean to Bruna's new husband. Goldman talked with CNN's Larry King about the international legal battle he is waging to gain custody of his son. King also talked to Helvecio Ribeiro, Bruna Goldman's uncle. The following is an edited version of the interviews. Larry King: What caused the breakup of the marriage? David Goldman: I don't know. Apparently, she decided she wanted to live in Brazil, where she said she had more friends and more family and where she was known. King: Did you feel happily married? Goldman: Yes, I thought we were happily married. King: So this was a call out of the blue? Goldman: I was completely blindsided and crushed. King: What did you do then? Goldman: Well, I (got) a phone call. My mom tracked it down as being Father's Day, about three days after they arrived. The first call was they got there safe, everything was OK. Then, I got a phone call and a very serious voice -- a voice they didn't recognize, really, as being, you know, it was out of her normal tone. Bruna says, \"David, we need to talk. You're a great guy. You're a wonderful father, but our love affair is ended, is over. I've decided I want to live in Brazil and you need to come down to Brazil immediately and sign 10 pages of papers with my attorney.\" There was a list of demands on these papers. One was giving her full custody. Another was to never go to the courts to file any claims of kidnapping or criminal charges. King: Did you get to talk to your son? Goldman: I got to talk to my son. In fact, I got to speak with all of them in the beginning, while they were still trying to get me to go down there and be trapped in this custody battle. At that point, I wasn't the enemy until I didn't meet her demands and I did go to the courts. King: Well, when you went (to Brazil), who did you see? What did you do? Goldman: I went to the courts. I went to every ruling on every court proceeding and with the guise that they would honor the Hague Treaty and return (my) son. And every time, it just got worse and worse. In the first instance, they kept Sean for over a year before they made this ruling. And then they said, 'Well, you know, yes, he was taken unlawfully and he should have been returned, but now he's settled with the mother. These are Brazilian judges who have admitted that he's been held unlawfully and wrongfully. King: How did you hear she died? Goldman: I have friends who, kind of, have an ear to the ground in Brazil, and there were some articles that came out in some local Brazilian newspapers and they did some on the Internet and said she'd passed away. King: Did you try then to get the child back legally? Goldman: Yes. As soon as I was notified, I called both counsel in Brazil and in the U.S., and they said it should be over. You know, we have stacks of court records and all these treaties and it's always been about Bruna and David, Bruna and David. There's no more Bruna. By all matters of law, international and national and Brazilian law, no one has a legal claim of custody but the living, biological parent. Go down to Brazil and bring your son home. King: What happened in court? Goldman: In this past court, we finally got a visitation ruling. But when I went down the first time to bring my son home, we find out that this man doesn't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. And with that, they gave him a provisionary guardianship -- a provisionary. King: Obviously, he wanted the boy? Goldman: Obviously. King: When you were (with him? Goldman: Oh, he was -- I just saw him this last February for the first time. King:  At eight years old, did he ask you why he's not with you? Goldman: He asked why I haven't come to see him in all this time. And that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. And I didn't want to tell him that the situation that I'm not allowed -- that they weren't allowing me, they're holding him. So I just told him that I had been there many times with his grandmother, with his grandfather, with his cousins, with family friends to see him, sometimes staying for up to two weeks and the courts -- it was difficult. King: How long did you have with him? Goldman: I saw him for two days a total of about six hours. King: How did you say goodbye? Goldman: It was very, very difficult. I just kept telling him the whole time how much I love him, how much I miss him. King: Did you tell him you were going to try to get him back? Goldman: No. I told him I'm going to always try to be with him. I don't want him to be put in any type of awkward situation or uncomfortable situation. I just told him I love him, I miss him and everyone at home loves him. And he remembers things at home. We spoke English. King: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has raised the Goldman case with the Brazilian government. Anything you'd say to her? Goldman: I'm just -- I'm so grateful and thankful that -- that she's helping me and she knows what's right and sees what's right and she cares about children and parents' rights to be with their own flesh and blood. - - - - - - - - - - - - . King followed the Goldman interview by talking to Helvecio Ribeiro, Bruna Goldman's uncle. King: Why do you think that David should not have his son? Why shouldn't he have his -- it's his son. Ribeiro: That's right. And I don't question the biological right. The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you're not there. And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so. I'm not sure if you know that, but he hasn't paid one single dime of child support so far. And he has been making allegations all over the place about us not allowing him to visit his child. They are completely untrue. King: Do you question whether David loves his child? Ribeiro: Oh, absolutely. I think that it's really easy to say that you love someone, but you have to act and show that. Mr. Goldman never had any interest on actually going down to Brazil, even to visit. I mean the child is not guilty of his parents' mistakes. I mean divorces happen all the time. And the parents should be responsible and work their way toward finding an agreement in which, you know, both parents are part of the children's lives. And he failed to do that because it was not in his best interests. King: How close is he [Sean's stepfather] with Sean? Ribeiro: Very close. Sean knows exactly that he is not his biological father, but he also calls him Daddy. Sean knows that, you know, Mr. Goldman is his biological father. Even though it was not mentioned during this interview, Sean normally talks to Mr. Goldman or at least used to talk to Mr. Goldman and also her -- his grandmother here in the United States. So he knows exactly the difference. He knows exactly who is who.\n\n**News 2**:\nCHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Key Illinois Democratic legislators are circulating a letter urging support for the impeachment of Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was arrested this week on federal corruption charges relating in part to the selection of President-elect Barack Obama's successor as a U.S. senator. Barack Obama says he has never spoken with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich about the vacant Senate seat. State Rep. John Fritchey, head of the House Civil Judiciary Committee, sent the letter Thursday asking Democratic colleagues to say by Friday whether they support a move for impeachment and would like to be added as a co-sponsor of legislation. Blagojevich also is a Democrat. \"Faced with a significant budget shortfall, a national recession, and a vacant United States Senate seat, we cannot afford to allow Illinois to operate without effective leadership in the [Illinois] executive branch,\" said the letter, also signed by Reps. Thomas Holbrook, David Miller and James Brosnahan. \"Simply put, it is imperative to replace Gov. Blagojevich as soon as is practicable.\" The letter said the impeachment filing was being prepared, and the lawmakers said they expected the process -- the state House would bring charges against Blagojevich and he would be tried by the state Senate -- would take \"a matter of weeks rather than months.\" The lawmakers' move coincided with increasing calls for Blagojevich's resignation. President-elect Barack Obama called again Thursday for Blagojevich to step down, saying the embattled governor can no longer effectively serve the people of Illinois.  Watch as Obama says Senate seat belongs to the people » . \"I hope that the governor himself comes to the conclusion that he can no longer effectively serve and that he does resign,\" Obama said, speaking before announcing his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Obama said he was as \"appalled and disappointed as anyone\" by the allegations against the Democratic governor, and said he was confident his staff was not involved in the alleged scandal. Federal officials said Blagojevich was looking to sell or trade Obama's open seat in the U.S. Senate. Obama said he had never spoken to the governor on the subject, adding he was confident that \"no representatives of mine would have any part of any deals related to this seat.\" He had asked his staff to gather the facts of any contacts with the governor's office about the vacancy, he said. \"This Senate seat does not belong to any politician to trade. It belongs to the people of Illinois, and they deserve the best possible representation,\" he said. \"They also deserve to know that any vacancy will be filled in an appropriate way so that whoever is sent to Washington is going to be fighting for the people of Illinois.\" Earlier Thursday, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said she is prepared to go to the Illinois Supreme Court to have Blagojevich declared unfit to serve if he does not resign.  Explainer: Federal complaint against Blagojevich » . \"Obviously the easiest way for us to move on in the state of Illinois is for Gov. Blagojevich to do the right thing for the people and to resign,\" she told CNN's \"American Morning.\" She added, \"If he fails to, the two other options are obviously the Legislature moving forward on impeachment, or I have the opportunity to actually go to our Illinois Supreme Court and ask them to declare, basically, that our governor is unable to serve,\" she said. In that case, Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, would become acting governor, she said. Madigan said she won't wait long to take action. \"We would like a signal from the Legislature if they're going to move forward on impeachment proceedings. ... I think there are obviously numerous members of the Legislature calling for impeachment proceedings,\" she said, noting that the Legislature, which is adjourned, will meet Monday to discuss the possibility of holding a special election for Obama's successor. Fritchey, in the letter to Democratic lawmakers, commended Madigan's willingness to go to the Supreme Court, but said \"both the duration as well as the outcome of such a proceeding are inherently uncertain and speculative.\"  Watch what was in the complaint against Blagojevich » . \"We would also note the comments of the attorney general indicating her support of impeachment proceedings as an appropriate course of action at this time,\" the letter said. Quinn said at a news conference earlier Thursday that the governor had lost the confidence of the people. \"I think the governor has one duty right now and that's the duty to resign,\" he said. Should he became governor, Quinn indicated he might lean toward appointing a successor to Obama's seat, saying an election would be expensive and time-consuming. \"Time is of the essence for all of us in America right now, to make sure we get our economy on the straight path to recovery,\" he said. Blagojevich -- who is free on his own recognizance -- returned to work Wednesday, his 52nd birthday. He has not commented on the charges, but his lawyer, Sheldon Sorosky, told reporters Tuesday night that his client \"feels he didn't do anything wrong.\" Sorosky said, \"He hopes the people of Illinois have faith in him, because he will be vindicated.\" White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said Thursday that President Bush believes the governor's arrest marks a \"very serious situation,\" and he believes the charges are \"astounding.\" Some details of the alleged scandal became clearer Wednesday, as a law enforcement official close to the investigation identified Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. as the person referred to in the federal criminal complaint as Senate Candidate 5. Of the six candidates mentioned in the complaint, Candidate 5 is the only one whom Blagojevich said engaged in discussion through an emissary about possibly raising money for the governor in exchange for the Senate position. Jackson firmly denied wrongdoing at a Wednesday news conference. \"I reject and denounce 'pay to play' politics and have no involvement whatsoever in any wrongdoing,\" he said. \"I did not initiate or authorize anyone at any time to promise anything to Gov. Blagojevich on my behalf. I never sent a message or an emissary to the governor to make an offer, to plead my case or to propose a deal about a U.S. Senate seat. Period.\" The law enforcement official said there was no evidence -- other than the governor's taped remarks -- that Jackson or others on his behalf ever approached the governor in an improper way. The official also emphasized that no conversations with Jackson were picked up on bugs or wiretaps, and there is no evidence that he was aware of anything improper. According to the complaint, Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris -- who was also arrested Tuesday on federal corruption charges -- were \"conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits\" for Blagojevich by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama. Federal investigators also allege the two were trying to have Chicago Tribune editorial board members fired by leveraging state assistance to the parent company of the newspaper, the Tribune Company, in its sale of Wrigley Field.  Explainer: Illinois governor is in hot water » . The governor and his chief of staff are also accused of sullying other areas of state business: trying to rescind $8 million of state funds to Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital because the hospital's chief executive officer had not contributed $50,000 to Blagojevich, and expecting a highway contractor to raise $500,000 in contributions in exchange for money for a tollway project. \"Because of the unimaginable allegations that were in the federal complaint, it really calls into question absolutely everything that the governor has authority to do,\" Madigan said Thursday on CNN's \"Situation Room.\" She said she had spoken to the governor only once this year, and perhaps not at all last year.  Watch whom Blagojevich has considered » . \"That sounds incredible, because I do serve as attorney general, so I'm the lawyer for the state, but we've been well aware for years that there are problems with this governor and so I haven't had anything to do with him,\" she said. She did not elaborate. Quinn said earlier this week that he had not spoken to the governor since summer 2007. Blagojevich and Harris are each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery, authorities said. iReport.com: Do you trust your leaders? The count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the count of solicitation of bribery carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.

He was 76. John Updike won many literary awards. His books, such as \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" were also best-sellers. Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer. He lived in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. \"He was one of our greatest writers, and he will be sorely missed,\" said Nicholas Latimer, vice president of publicity at Updike's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Updike was a rarity among American writers: a much-esteemed, prize-winning author whose books -- including \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960), \"Couples\" (1968), \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984) and \"Terrorist\" (2006) -- were also best-sellers. Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice: for \"Rabbit Is Rich\" (1981) and its successor, \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1991). iReport: Share your tributes to John Updike . The \"Rabbit\" series, about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike's hometown of Shillington, Pennsylvania, spanned four novels, a novella and four decades. In the books -- which also included 1971's \"Rabbit Redux\" and a 2001 novella, \"Rabbit Remembered\" -- onetime basketball star Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom negotiates marriage, divorce, wealth and health problems, never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life. \"Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection, but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood, and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking,\" wrote Time's Lev Grossman in naming \"Rabbit, Run\" to Time's \"All-Time 100 Novels\" list. Updike was incredibly prolific, penning essays, reviews, short stories, poetry and memoirs. His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker, including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams' final game, \"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu.\" \"No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John,\" said David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, in a statement. \"Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine, loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young. \"We adored him,\"  Remnick continued. \"He was, for so long, the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him.\" The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years, including 327 book reviews, 170 short stories and 154 poems. He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts. \"John Updike's place among America's literary greats is forever secure, as is his special place in every Red Sox fan's heart for his magnificent 'Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,' \" Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement. \"We honor his memory and his contributions, and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own.\" Updike never won a Nobel Prize, but one of his characters, Henry Bech, received one in \"Bech at Bay\" (1998). His works, particularly given their sexual content, could be as divisive as they were poetic. Many critics accused him of misogyny, and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream. \"It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book,\" the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001. But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers, the cover of Time magazine (for 1968's \"Couples\") and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain's Literary Review. He was criticized by Norman Mailer, hailed by fellow author (and Updike obsessive) Nicholson Baker in \"U and I\" and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a \"Simpsons\" episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book. \"[I] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield,\" Updike said, noting that the hardest part of his performance was \"producing a chuckle.\" John Hoyer Updike was born March 18, 1932, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Shillington. From an early age he took to reading and writing, and earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where he headed the Harvard Lampoon. Upon graduation, he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England. By the time he was 23, he had been offered a position at The New Yorker, which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years. Updike's first novel, \"The Poorhouse Fair,\" came out in 1959. The next year, in \"Rabbit, Run,\" he introduced Angstrom, who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction. When introduced, Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife, the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life. Over the course of the \"Rabbit\" books, the character would routinely infuriate his spouse, mistresses and offspring, try to make things right, and never quite succeed. His attitude didn't help. \"Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who has the brains. God maybe,\" the character said in \"Rabbit, Run.\" \"Rabbit, Run\" was successful, as were Updike's other '60s books, including \"The Centaur\" (1963), which featured a teacher much like Updike's father, and the short story collection \"The Music School\" (1966). But it was \"Couples\" that made Updike a household name. The book, about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts, became a No. 1 best-seller. Updike's interests ranged widely. He wrote about an African state in \"The Coup\" (1978). He discussed the relationship between science and religion in \"Roger's Version\" (1986). He revisited \"Hamlet\" in \"Gertrude and Claudius\" (2000). And he created a group of promiscuous witches in \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984), which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil. Though Updike's work routinely sold well, he was painfully aware of the decline of what's come to be called \"literary fiction.\" In a 2000 interview with Salon, he lamented its difficulties. \"When I was a boy, the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher's shelf. I mean, Steinbeck, Hemingway, some Faulkner. Faulkner actually had, considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are, quite a middle-class readership,\" he said. \"But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent. You don't feel that now.\" And yet, Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word, and the pleasure brought by jotting, tuning, refining -- creating -- a new story, even as the years drifted by. \"An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while,\" he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year. \"The pleasures, for him, of book-making ... remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best.\" Updike's most recent novel, \"The Widows of Eastwick,\" came out in 2008. A collection of stories, \"My Father's Tears and Other Stories,\" is due out later this year.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- Roll out the pink carpet, grab a feather boa and throw open those Malibu Dream House doors. It's Barbie's 50th, and the iconic doll, unveiled today in her latest swimsuit, has plenty to celebrate. The classic 1959 Barbie strikes a pose in front of an early Malibu Barbie Camper. Only this American institution could have inspired Barbara Karleskint, 48, to spend nearly $700 so she and one of her dolls could wear matching red chiffon gowns and capes at an annual collectors gathering. \"Look, we're not as bad as the Star Trek convention people,\" Karleskint, who lives outside of Orlando, Florida, said with a laugh. Collecting Barbies \"brings me joy; that's all I can say. And life's not worth living unless you have some joy.\" With 8 million active collectors dotting the globe, according to Mattel, Karleskint is hardly alone. Since Mattel introduced Barbie in 1959, she has become a household name -- owned by 90 percent of American girls ages 3 to 10 and sold in 150 countries, said Lauren Dougherty, a Mattel spokeswoman. Barbie attracts 50 million visitors to her Web site each month, she added. See Barbie dolls from all over the world » . Along the way, she spawned a cosmetics line, apparel stores throughout Asia and an entertainment franchise that has sold more than 65 million DVDs.  Watch old toys get new life » . Last week, a six-story flagship store opened in Shanghai, China. And a real-life Malibu Dream House, a temporary home tricked out for Barbie's birthday -- including a chandelier made of her hair -- is currently on display in California. Not bad for a doll that, according to author Robin Gerber, was initially inspired by \"a sexually-themed gag toy for men.\" The now-legendary doll was conceived by Ruth Handler, a daughter of Polish immigrants, said Gerber, author of the newly published \"Barbie and Ruth: The Story of the World's Most Famous Doll and the Woman Who Created Her.\" She and her husband, Elliott, owned Mattel until a scandal involving accusations of cooked books drove them out in 1975, Gerber said. Handler, who died in 2002, used to watch her own daughter, Barbara, play with paper dolls. Then, on a trip to Europe, Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character, named Lilli, who used sex to get what she wanted. \"My guess is she didn't know what it was when she bought it,\" because at that point, four years after the Lilli doll's release, it had landed in European toy stores, the author explained. Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work. \"Who would have thought,\" Gerber said. Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character \"who was essentially a prostitute.\" Though the men at Mattel, a company that had never sold dolls before, were skeptical at best, Handler proved to be \"a corporate genius,\" Gerber said. In the three years after Barbie's release, Mattel's worth grew to $200 million, doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business. Handler's daughter, now Barbara Segal, 67, is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype. \"It's been quite an interesting ride,\" she said from her Los Angeles, California, area home. \"I can't believe this doll's created all of this.\" Barbie's collector line (not what's seen on Wal-Mart shelves) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie. Many say Barbie is an antidote to adult woes, allowing them to recapture their youth and revisit simpler times. iReport.com: See, share Barbie collections . The woman behind Sandi Holder's Doll Attic in Union City, California, strolled through her 3,000-square-foot warehouse and one-of-a-kind Barbie museum, home to thousands of dolls, and spoke of the visitors who flock through her doors each year.  Tour an iReporter's Barbie dream house » . She says the doll can evoke powerful emotions and has seen visitors weep for a lost sibling or childhood friend. But Holder, 51, who gave up a nursing career to pursue her Barbie dream more than 20 years ago, said that while trips to the museum can be emotional, they're also full of laughter and stories. \"No one leaves without sharing a fond portion of their childhood with me,\" said Holder, who once snagged a record for selling a doll at auction for $27,600. Barbie, however, doesn't conjure up smiles for everyone. Though the 11.5-inch doll can't be single-handedly blamed for the eating disorders and body-image issues that plague young women, Ellyn Kaschak, a psychology professor at San Jose Sate University in California, said Barbie, especially given her prevalence, is part of the problem. \"I don't think the concerns are overblown at all,\" said Kaschak, one of the founders in the 1970s of the feminist psychology field. \"Blow her up to normal [human] size, and she'd fall over,\" she said of Barbie's unattainable figure. Still standing, however, is Cindy Jackson, a 53-year-old woman inspired by Barbie to do much more than collect dolls and splurge on matching outfits. Over the course of more than two decades, Jackson has gone under the knife for 13 full-scale operations, including multiple procedures each time, and hundreds of less intrusive cosmetic tune-ups in order to achieve the \"all-American beauty\" look she said Barbie represents. She grew up in rural Ohio, \"plain and unpopular,\" she said. \"Every real woman around me was a farmer's wife, a factory worker, a mother or a school teacher. ... For me, it was soul-destroying. There was no glamour whatsoever.\" And then she met her first Barbie, a vintage doll sporting a bubble cut, \"a sidelong glance\" and dressed as Jackie Kennedy, she remembered. \"It was powerful,\" Jackson said from her London, England, home. \"I'd never seen a real woman who looked like that, and I thought, 'That's what I want to look like.' \" Concern about Barbie's looks and her values, including materialism -- she has worn about 1 billion outfits, Mattel's Dougherty said -- has at times gained ire from more than feminists and psychologists. The recent release of Tattoo Barbie, for instance, has gotten under the skin of some parents.  Watch video about the controversy » . But such criticism misses the point of what Barbie is all about, according to diehard fans. iReport.com: Barbie's body is not the issue . \"It's not about wanting to look like her. It's about imagining what could be,\" said Nancy Parsons, of western Pennsylvania, who is chairwoman of the Barbie 50th Anniversary Gala, this year's collectors convention planned for July. \"People who say it's a bad influence -- they don't know the imagination that goes into playing with dolls. ... My sister always pretended she was a nurse, and [now] she's a nurse.\" All told, Barbie has held down 108 careers, Mattel says. She's been a police officer, a doctor, a veterinarian, an astronaut and a presidential candidate. Women, by the way, are not the only ones drawn to Barbie. Up to 20 percent of annual convention attendees, who fly in from all over the world, are men, this year's chairwoman, Parsons, said. In her own collector's club there are two of them: \"One's a hair dresser, and one's an auto mechanic,\" she said. Scott Warren, 45, of Orlando, Florida, will attend his seventh consecutive annual convention this summer. The \"novice fashion fan,\" as he described himself, has been collecting Barbies for about 14 years and counts among his favorites his Versace Barbie, Ralph Lauren Barbie and Diane von Fürstenberg Barbie. \"I know there's no way I can afford a designer's original, but I think it's cool that my Barbies can,\" he said.

Barbie has had a long partnership with top designers, 50 of whom jumped at the chance to participate in the Barbie Runway Show in New York last month, bringing life-sized Barbie fashions to the catwalk. \"A lot of them say she was their first client, the first model they dressed,\" said Mattel's Dougherty. \"We thought it was the perfect place to kick off her celebration.\""}

Martin \"Al\" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919. WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- \"I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe\" As World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. \"The boys are just starting to sing,\" Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. \"They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far.\" Stephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends. But Culhane, known as \"Al,\" and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War. They would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history. Culhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time \"chum\" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war. Three weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again. Already the flu occupies his thoughts.  Learn more about the current swine flu » . \"Received a nice letter from Phil Byrne he reports he is getting along fine, is feeling better than he has ever before.\" Byrne, a friend from Chicago, was one of the early survivors of the Spanish flu. Other members of the Byrne family took ill a few months later, according to the letters. In the same letter he mentions how the Army was trying to protect the troops at Camp Forrest: . \"Since noon today our camp has been under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza. We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company.\" That same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, \"Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition.\" At first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: \"I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies.\" Just six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: \"Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family.\" What Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from \"my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather.\" His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died. In the United States the mortality rate was lower, but still a devastating 3 percent. It was a crisis for the Army. Military bases, with thousands of men from all over the country in tightly packed barracks, were fertile breeding grounds for the flu, especially one as easily spread as this one. And unlike most flu strains that mostly strike the elderly, the very young or the sick, Spanish flu hit healthy, young adults like Army draftees. Just three days after telling his friend about being sick, Culhane wrote that he was feeling better. \"I am still in quarantine but will be released today. I am feeling great and the two day's rest has done me a world of good. I have done nothing at all but sit in the shade, read and write letters.\" His recovery from the Spanish flu was swift, but the very next day, October 7, 1918, he wrote to give \"all the details of the death of a very good friend, my Bunkie, Thomas Birdie. His body will go north today, I think,\" Culhane wrote, asking Pinter to attend the wake. \"At his side, say a few prayers for the repose of his soul.\" When not writing about the flu, Culhane dropped none-too-subtle hints about wanting care packages full of cookies from home. And he regularly questioned why other friends didn't write. He also worried that he was \"neglecting the ladies.\" He pelts his friend Clif with questions about Ursula (\"Her Majesty,\" he jokingly refers to her), Ella (the young woman to whom he promised a prized golf club) Ida (\"I had a long letter from Ida Flynn. Boy! I will have a job on my hands when I get home\") and the Marys (Mary Rose, Mary English, Mary Anne). While Culhane writes about and to a lot of young ladies, there is no sign in the letters which one, if any, held a special place in his heart. Still he worried about one young man named \"Hank\" who remained in Chicago. \"Keep the ladies amused by all means, but I look to you to protect my interests. Hank is too darn nice a chap to be safe around the ladies. However, if he seems to get extra strong I will write a note and have him made Admiral of the Arctic Circle.\" After recovering from the flu, Culhane bemoans the fact that war was about to end. \"It is almost over now and thirty days will see at least a cessation of hostilities. Xmas will see peace. I will never see France and as long as that is impossible I might as well be out of the Army as soon as it is over.\" Nine days later, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the war ended. And just four days after the fighting in Europe ended, the letters from Camp Forrest stopped. Al Culhane was sick again. This time he was taken to U.S. General Hospital #14 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. And he couldn't keep the latest illness a secret from his family back home in Chicago. A Catholic chaplain wrote the family that he was sick and not able to write himself. When he was well enough, he wrote Pinter, \"I don't know just what I have but it felt like old fashioned grip or perhaps 'The Flu.'\". It took about two weeks before he was out of the Fort Oglethorpe hospital and back at Camp Forrest. He had twice survived the deadliest flu in history and lived to write home about it. After his second recovery his concerns turned to getting back to Chicago by Christmas. \"Clif I have seen my discharge all written out and from that moment on my usefulness as a soldier ceased.\" But again illness got in the way. This time it was a completely different one: \"Measles has broken out in our company and we are quarantined. Did you ever hear of harder luck in all your life?\" Culhane didn't make it back to Chicago for Christmas. But he eventually did return home alive and well. He never did make it to France, but traveled the United States extensively with his wife, Evelyn, a woman never mentioned in his letters home, but someone he'd known since they went through First Holy Communion together. As for Clif Pinter, who saved the letters, he and Al Culhane remained \"old chums\" for life. After Pinter's death, his son passed the letters on to Al's daughter, Dorothy Clarke, who passed them onto Al's grandchildren, including Lawrence Aloysius Shaughnessy, who works for CNN's Pentagon unit and occasionally writes stories about soldiers for CNN.com."}

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said swine flu is no more danerous than the regular flu virus. \"What the epidemiologists are seeing now with this particular strain of U.N. is that the severity of the disease, the severity of the flu -- how sick you get -- is not stronger than regular seasonal flu,\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Monday as the worldwide number of confirmed cases of swine flu -- technically known as 2009 H1N1 virus -- topped 1,080. The flu has been blamed for 26 deaths: 25 in Mexico and one in the United States, according to the World Health Organization. Still, Napolitano noted, the seasonal flu results in \"hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations\" and roughly 35,000 fatalities each year in the United States. There are still concerns that the virus could return in the fall, in the typical flu season, as a stronger strain. \"We are cautiously optimistic that this particular strain will not be more severe than a normal seasonal flu outbreak,\" Napolitano said.  Watch Napolitano assess the swine flu risk » . Napolitano acknowledged claims by health officials in Mexico, the epicenter of the H1N1 outbreak, who believe their cases have peaked and said, \"I have no reason to think that is inaccurate.\" The WHO said there were no immediate plans to raise its alert to the highest level, Phase 6. That designation would mean \"that we are seeing continued spread of the virus to countries outside of one region,\" Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda said. \"If you are seeing community outbreaks occur in multiple regions of the world, it really tells us if the virus has established itself and that we can expect to see disease in most countries in the world.\" In the United States, the CDC on Monday reported confirmed 279 cases across 36 states -- 60 more than were confirmed the day before. Several states, including New York and Massachusetts, confirmed dozens more cases Monday that were not immediately added to the CDC tally.  See where the H1N1 virus has spread across the world » . Earlier, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the CDC \"erroneously\" doubled the cases in his state. Jindal confirmed his state's total is seven, and the CDC dropped its nationwide count from 286 to 279. Many of the cases are among children; the median age is 16, said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the CDC. The youngest confirmed case is a 3-month-old, he said. There are also more than 700 probable cases across 44 states, Besser said. \"This likely represents an underestimation of the total number of cases across the country,\" he said, because not everyone with flu-like symptoms goes to the doctor and gets tested. The numbers are expected to increase. Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's interim deputy director for public health, said Sunday, \"We believe we're just on the upswing here.\" But in Mexico, where the first cases were reported, illnesses may have peaked for now. Mexico City will reopen government offices and restaurants Wednesday, and museums, libraries and churches Thursday as officials cited improvements in the battle against swine flu. Officials said university and secondary students can return to class Thursday while younger students will wait until May 11. In another sign of improving conditions with the H1N1 virus, federal officials lowered the nation's health alert level Monday from red, or \"high,\" to orange, or \"elevated.\" \"The measures we have taken, and above all the public's reaction, have led to an improvement,\" Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said at a news conference. \"But I insist that the virus is still present, that we need to remain on alert, and the resumption of activities will be little by little, not all at once.\" The Mexican and Chinese government sent chartered flights to each other's countries Tuesday to pick up their respective nationals stranded or quarantined because of the global swine flu outbreak. An Aeromexico flight was making several stops throughout China to collect nearly 70 citizens who were being held in quarantine across the communist nation as part of its strict swine flu-control measures. The flight will make stops in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Guangzhou. Meanwhile, a U.S. Embassy official said four Americans are or were quarantined in China: two in Beijing; two in the southern Guangdong province. The official could not say whether the two in Guangdong had been released, nor did she provide additional details. In the U.S., residents gripped by concerns about the swine flu, also had a hopeful sign Monday. The St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, New York -- which had the first confirmed U.S. cases of swine flu -- reopened Monday. More than 100 St. Francis students had come down with flu symptoms two weeks ago. Some were tested and found to have the H1N1 virus.  Learn more about the H1N1 influenza virus » . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was on hand to welcome them back  to a school that had undergone an intense scrub-down. \"The school has been completely sanitized,\" St. Francis Principal Leonard Conway said in a letter to students and their parents. The U.S. Department of Education said that 533 schools were shut Monday, about 100 more than Friday and about half of 1 percent of all schools in the United States. The closures affect about 330,000 students in 24 states. New cases of swine flu were leaving soldiers isolated in California. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marine Base at Twentynine Palms, north of Palm Springs, California, said two new cases of the flu were confirmed by the CDC. The two Marines show no symptoms but are being kept in isolation, spokeswoman Jennie Haskamp said. Previously, one other case was confirmed at the base. The U.S. Defense Department also reported that a crew member stationed aboard the USS Dubuque in San Diego, California, was confirmed to have swine flu and is currently ashore. The department said there were 13 other \"probable\" cases among Dubuque personnel. And California officials were looking into a suspected case at Centinela State Prison in Imperial County. Authorities suspended visitation and other \"non-essential activities\" at the prison pending confirmation. Even as health officials worldwide worked to battle the outbreak, intense efforts were under way to develop a vaccine -- with lessons from history in mind. \"In 1918, the Spanish flu showed a surge in the spring and then disappeared in the summer months, only to return in the autumn of 1918 with a vengeance,\" WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said Sunday. \"And we know that that eventually killed 40 million to 50 million people.\" Health officials are not making such dire predictions in this case. And they can't know for certain whether the swine flu will make a big return later in the year. Still, they're taking no chances. In that effort, health officials have a tool unlike anything they've had before. \"This is the best surveillance we've ever had,\" Fukuda said Monday. \"You know, we're really monitoring and able to see a situation unfold in a way we have never been able to do in history before.\" In Hong Kong, about 200 hotel guests and 100 staff members at the Metropark Hotel remain under quarantine until Friday after health officials determined that a guest there had contracted the H1N1 virus.  Watch how a British citizen has been quarantined in Hong Kong » . \"We go down to the lobby for food and then back to the room to eat your food,\" said Leslie Carr, a British man who is one of the 300 stuck at the hotel. \"Not many people are downstairs hanging around to talk or discuss anything.\" Hong Kong, in particular, is extra careful after a SARS outbreak in 2003 killed almost 300 people. \"In view of the lack of data ... we have to be very cautious,\" said Yuen Kwok-Yung of Hong Kong University. \"I believe that as time goes by, we can change our strategy.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul in Mexico City, John Vause in Beijing, Diana Magnay in Geneva and Pauline Choo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\nATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- OutKast's Big Boi is a junkie, has been for years. Big Boi: \"You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair.\" The multiplatinum rap star got his first shoe fix back when he was better known as Antwan Patton, a busboy at Steak and Ale. He saved up his paychecks and rushed to a dealer to cop the only thing that could cure his jones -- a pair of British Knights tennis shoes. \"I've actually been into sneakers since I was a little kid,\" Big Boi, 34, said backstage before his concert this month at the Sneaker Pimps exhibition in Atlanta. \"You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair.\" Sneaker culture has thrived for decades, but shoe companies have increasingly capitalized on the demand for one-of-a-kind kicks. Collectors, known as sneakerheads, have lined up to pay hundreds, even thousands, of dollars to ensure few people are wearing the same shoes.  See some of the rarest shoes » . \"Coming up, my mom got five kids so there wasn't a whole lot of stylish tennis shoes around the house, so I used to want a lot of sneakers,\" Big Boi said, explaining that he started making up for lost time -- and shoes -- long before OutKast's 1994 debut, \"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik.\" Juan Castaneda, 27, also grew up in a family of modest means and longed to don the fresh kicks he saw his peers wearing. \"When I got money to buy them, I started catching up,\" said Castaneda, who works at a nursing home in Hendersonville, North Carolina. He estimates he owns about 200 pairs of sneakers, including a pair of Nike Air Jordan XIs with patent-leather trim called \"Space Jams.\" They cost him $500. It's supply and demand at its simplest, said Elliott Curtis, a former Carnegie Mellon University basketball player who for two semesters taught Sneakerology 101, billed as the first accredited class on sneaker culture. Shoe companies create a limited number (say, a few hundred pairs) of shoes -- even if it's just an old model with new colors or materials -- and demand automatically spikes. \"It's like a status symbol. If Nike is selling a shoe for $2,000, they're not expecting to sell that many,\" the recent graduate said, adding that sneakerheads are drawn to scarcity. \"If they've got money, they can buy coolness,\" Curtis said. Curtis goes to garage sales and mom-and-pop stores seeking rare and retro sneakers for his 75-pair collection, but he concedes he's waited in line for limited editions and paid as much as $250 for a pair. Sporting an ultra-rare set of blue-and-red \"Bugs Bunny\" Nike Air Jordan VIIIs, Big Boi said he today boasts at least 400 pairs of sneakers, but he rarely pays for them because shoe companies send him pairs. His most expensive, a pair of crocodile-skin Nike Air Force 1s, sell on various auction sites for up to $1,800. Big Boi has never worn them, but he plans on taking them out of their Nike lockbox this summer so he can wear them in a video for his upcoming solo album. To Peter Fahey, the mastermind behind Sneaker Pimps shoe shows, Big Boi's enthusiasm is typical. Sneaker culture got its start in New York in the 1970s, mostly among playground streetballers and practitioners of an emerging genre of music called hip-hop. Over the next three decades, rappers and basketball players -- most notably, Run DMC and Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan -- would play integral roles in boosting the popularity of rare kicks. \"Run DMC were probably at the height of the whole movement. It was the first time music and sneakers crossed like this,\" Fahey said of the group's 1986 hit, \"My Adidas.\" Today, Adidas, Nike and Puma compete with luxury brands such as Chanel, Prada and Gucci. The major sports shoe companies also allow customers to design their own shoes. Upstarts such as San Francisco's JB Classics and Japan's Madfoot and KKOK have snatched up market share as well. Shoe companies realize hip-hop's influence and work hard to get \"a fresh pair of steps\" on a rapper's feet. Earlier this year, Converse released a line of its iconic All-Stars in tandem with Chicago rhymesmith Lupe Fiasco. Nike has issued two versions of the Air Yeezy, inspired by rapper-producer Kanye West. Louis Vuitton also has teamed up with West. Some lines, such as the Yeezys, quickly become collectors' items. Die-hard sneakerheads keep them in their original boxes like \"Star Wars\" action figures and ferret them away in closets, their soles never to be scuffed by a sidewalk. Bryan Lyle, 22, of Stockbridge, Georgia, said he recently camped out three nights at an Atlanta boutique to get one of the shop's eight pairs of Air Yeezys. Lyle paid $300, a small fortune for shoes, but Castaneda said the price more than doubled within days. He got a pair of Yeezys from an eBay merchant in Hong Kong. The damage? $700. Melissa Bailey of Hendersonville, North Carolina, takes photos at the Sneaker Pimps show. Castaneda's girlfriend, Melissa Bailey, 26, said Castaneda actually bought three pairs. He found two online and paid someone to camp out for the others. Castaneda's modus operandi is to buy three pairs of his favorite shoes -- one to wear, one to store for later and one to sell or trade, she said. \"He will not walk through grass. He will not walk through dirt,\" Bailey said. For the last six years, Fahey has had a front-row seat for the evolution of sneaker culture. He held the first Sneaker Pimps show in Sydney, Australia, in 2003, but only 200 people showed up, belying the trend's rising popularity. Soon, however, tens of thousands would attend shows in more than 60 cities. A 2006 show in Jakarta, Indonesia, drew about 13,000 sneakerheads. The shows now feature between 1,000 and 1,500 shoes. Some are rare. Others are signed by celebrities. Hip-hop acts are a staple, as is artwork -- on both kicks and canvas. At this month's show, hundreds of sneaker enthusiasts filed through Atlanta's Tabernacle with the decorum of museum patrons, stopping to admire the shoes displayed on swaths of chain-link fence. There were novice sneakerheads, such as Chris Shepherd, 20, and Charnelle Cook, 20, an Atlanta couple who marveled over the DC Comics and Transformers sneakers. Asked about her multicolored hightops, Cook said, \"I couldn't tell you what these are called. All I know is they're Reeboks, and they're fly.\" There were seasoned collectors, such as Kyle Self, 35, of Decatur, Georgia, who said he had about 25 pairs, some of them still in their boxes. Included in the group are three pairs of $400 low-top Pradas, which he called his \"everyday sneakers.\" There were even female collectors, such as artist Estasha Goodwin, 23, who modeled a pair of shimmering gold, winged -- yes, winged -- hightops made by Adidas and designer Jeremy Scott. She complained that shoe companies too often focus on the male market and ignored female aficionados. \"When they do cater to us, it's always bubblegum pink. They don't even make them in our sizes,\" she said. \"I know women who know more about sneakers than any dude out here today.\" Incidentally, her favorite of the 15 pairs she owns were made for men -- the Nike \"Ace of Spades\" Dunks, inspired by the Detroit Tigers' high-kicking pitcher, Dontrelle Willis, who is prominently featured on the black-and-aqua shoe's hightop. Asked why she shelled out $250 for them, she gave a familiar response: \"It's a feeling you get when you know you're the only one that has something. Even if you're not, it's the way you walk it.\""}
{"tokens_range": "4k", "total_prompt_tokens": 3779, "how_many_news": 2, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNET) -- If you want to consider a difficult computational problem, try thinking of the algorithms required to animate more than 10,000 helium balloons, each with its own string, but each also interdependent on the rest, which are collectively hoisting aloft a small house. The production team at Pixar faced many new technological challenges on \"Up,\" its tenth feature film. That was the challenge the production team at Pixar faced when it set out to begin work on \"Up,\" its tenth feature film, five years in the works, which hits theaters on Friday. There was absolutely no way the team was going to hand-animate the balloons. Not with their numbers in five-figures, and especially not when you consider that within the cluster, every interaction between two balloons has a ripple effect: If one bumped another, the second would move, likely bumping a third, and so on. And every bit of this would need to be seen on screen. In \"Up,\" the story revolves around the main character, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen, who, frustrated with his mundane life, ties the thousands of balloons to his house and sets off for adventures in South America. A small boy ends up marooned on board, and hilarity ensues. The cluster of balloons is so central to the film's branding--it's called \"Up,\" after all--that to promote the film, Pixar teamed up with two of the world's cluster ballooning experts for a nationwide tour involving a real-life flying armchair and dozens of huge, colorful balloons. \"You have a movie that's about a house that flies, which is a pretty far-fetched idea,\" said Steve May, the supervising technical director on \"Up.\" \"We all know, from kids' parties, how a bunch of balloons behave, so if we could animate balloons in a realistic way, the believability that the house could fly would sell.\" For May, \"Up\" producer Jonas Rivera, director Pete Docter, and the many others involved in making the film, believability was key, even within the context of a story about a flying house. And while a major part of instilling that believability must come from a well-conceived and executed story and script, the animation is no less responsible for winning over potentially skeptical audiences. Balloons, the mother of animation invention May said that the animation department at Pixar never even considered hand-animating the balloons. But even standard computer animation wouldn't be up to the task, because of the N-squared complexity involved in the thousands of interdependent balloons. Instead, the studio's computer whizzes figured out a way to turn the problem over to a programmed physical simulator, which, employing Newtonian physics, was able to address the animation problem. \"These are relatively simple physical equations, so you program them into the computer and therefore kind of let the computer animate things for you, using those physics,\" said May. \"So in every frame of the animation, (the computer can) literally compute the forces acting on those balloons, (so) that they're buoyant, that their strings are attached, that wind is blowing through them. And based on those forces, we can compute how the balloon should move.\" This process is known as procedural animation, and is described by an algorithm or set of equations, and is in stark contrast to what is known as key frame animation, in which the animators explicitly define the movement of an object or objects in every frame. Procedural animation has been around for some time, but May suggested that even the most difficult uses of it in the past don't come close to what Pixar had to achieve in \"Up.\" Pixar fans may remember the scenes in \"Cars\" of a stadium full of 300,000 car \"fans\" cheering on a high-speed race below, each of which was independently animated. That, too, was done with procedural animation, May said, since creating so many cars individually would have been a non-starter. But even that complex computation problem didn't approach the balloon cluster issue in \"Up\": the \"Cars\" scene involved no interdependent physics. Getting the simulator humming properly is no easy task, as one might imagine. May said it involves setting rules for how individual objects should behave, giving the computer these initial conditions, and then \"let it run.\" Oddly, because the simulator does indeed run with those conditions and rules and the peculiarities of physics, the animators found themselves without precise control of what would happen with the balloons--or other objects in the film animated using these techniques. \"If the (balloon cluster) is moving too slow, we increase the amount of wind, and then run the simulator again,\" May said. \"Then maybe we turn the wind down. It's a little fun science experiment where sometimes, hopefully by the end, we're getting what we want.\" Losing control of balloons Sometimes, given the vagaries of physics and chaos theory, unexpected things happen. The computer team inputs the rules and because some of the initial conditions are random, \"you get semi-random results.\" One of May's favorite examples is that early in the film, when the house first is hoisted aloft by the balloons, a small group of the balloons actually broke off of the main cluster. May said that this breakaway group of balloons is actually visible--albeit very briefly--in \"Up.\" Eagle-eyed moviegoers can see the escaped balloons in the upper right-hand side of the screen, he said. \"We didn't mean for that to happen,\" he said, \"but (we said) 'It's cool, let's keep it.'\" Even being able to make such choices wasn't possible at the beginning of the film's production, however. May said Pixar's physical simulator, an open-source program called ODE, couldn't initially handle the complexity of modeling the behavior of more than 10,000 balloons. \"We could handle about 500 (balloons), and we knew we needed tens of thousands,\" he said. \"We knew we needed to develop a new simulator software pipeline...to handle an order of magnitude more complex simulation.\" Of course, at Pixar, adjusting to evolving computer needs on the fly is nothing new. In fact, May said the studio has done so in one form or another on many of its films. For example, he said that when the studio made \"Monsters, Inc.,\" it had to figure out how to animate the movie's monsters' fur. Similarly, when Pixar made \"Finding Nemo,\" the animators had to figure out how to simulate underwater scenes. \"We had to learn about (how light refracts under water), and murk and how particulates float under water,\" May said. And in \"Up,\" too, there were additional animation challenges. Among them were figuring out how to animate and render the feathers on Kevin, a bird that is a major character in the film, and how to make the cloth on (main character) Carl's clothes seem believable. Carl's threads were \"the hardest clothing we've ever had to animate here,\" said May, \"in part because Carl's a (small) man in an oversized suit. That was another case of (using) the physical simulation, and of setting up rules for how cloth should behave. And the looser the clothing, the more it can behave badly.\" Even Carl himself presented some animation difficulties, May said, because the character's head is shaped like a cube. Like many other elements in \"Up,\" the cube-shape of Carl's face wasn't a random whim of the director. Rather, it is a story element: May explained that Carl's character is based on someone who, as a young man, was vivacious and adventurous. But as he grew older, his small house became more and more surrounded by buildings, and \"it's like his world has compressed him into a square.\" Thus, a cube-like face. But May said animating his facial expressions, which must fit into this cube shape, was complicated. Smiles, for example, had to come up and wrap around his cheek. Still, for the award-winning filmmakers at Pixar, the goal is to make even the hardest animation problems look simple on the silver screen. As producer Jonas Rivera put it, \"The audience looks at (the balloon cluster) and says, 'Oh, that's pretty.' But they have no idea how much work went into it. We worked on that for over a year. (Then) the kid takes off his hat and runs his fingers through his hair. My mother will never know that took 15 people six weeks.\" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations. The presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks. The candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by TIME at Columbia University in New York. A coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS's Judy Woodruff. Asked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are \"fading\" in the minds of many Americans, McCain said: . \"We needed at that time [September 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the United States of America.\" McCain criticized the Bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the American public to live their lives as usual and \"go shopping.\" \"I would have called them to serve,\" said McCain.  The GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want \"change\" in federal government. \"They understand the challenges that we have in this world. They see the Russian invasion of the little country called Georgia. They see the problems in Afghanistan growing larger. They see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them.\"  Watch McCain talk about service » . McCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive \"sufficient recognition\" from Washington. But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. Asked about compensation for service McCain said: . \"I'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... Finding new ways to serve. That's what this next few years should be all about.\" McCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama's community service in Illinois. \"Look, Gov. Palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. That's what she was responding to. Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community. And Sen. Obama's record there is outstanding.\" McCain also said that politics is \"tough business,\" and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America. Obama said his views don't necessarily differ from McCain's on national service. He said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well. \"Part of what makes America work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves.\" Obama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service. \"One of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. And so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.\" Obama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers. \"The fact is that we have to have government.  When a hurricane strikes, as it did with Katrina, we have to have a FEMA that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job.\"   Watch Obama talk about service » . \"Now, that does not crowd out the Red Cross. That doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. What it means is that each area has a role to play.\" The forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. Nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to \"celebrate the power and potential of citizen service\" and lay out a plan to address \"America's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service,\" according to the organizers' Web site. Each presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a \"cause greater than oneself.\" Obama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college. In a speech in December, the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president. \"This will be the cause of my presidency,\" he said. Today's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns. McCain's campaign recently attacked Obama for \"lipstick\" remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday. \"John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,' \" he said. \"That's not change. That's just calling ... the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing.\"  Watch how tensions are rising on the trail » . The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's. Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in \"lies\" and \"swift boat politics.\" \"I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics,\" he said in Norfolk, Virginia. \"Enough is enough.\"  Watch Obama deliver his harsh words » . The phrase \"swift boat\" comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false. But the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on Thursday. They appeared together in New York to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the World Trade Center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives plowed into them on September 11, 2001. The two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials. Earlier in the day, McCain attended a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field there on September 11, 2001. Many believe that the hijackers intended to crash Flight 93 into the U.S. Capitol in Washington. \"Hundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom,\" McCain said. \"They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph. \"I've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for America's sake,\" he said. The Obama campaign released a statement earlier Thursday for its candidate in which he said, \"We will never forget those who died. \"On 9/11, Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country,\" Obama said. \"Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.\" Meanwhile, a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival, Obama, would be better on the issue. The poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points. Opinion Research Corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from September 5-7 for the poll. Time's Michael Duffy contributed to this report."}

One by one, a two-star general delivered flags flown over the Pentagon in their honor. He looked them in their eyes and snapped his right hand in salute. Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles salutes Berga survivor Edward Slotkin, 84, at an event in Orlando Saturday. \"National treasures,\" Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles said Saturday evening. It marked the first time in history the U.S. Army recognized 350 soldiers held as slaves inside Nazi Germany. The men were beaten, starved and forced to work in tunnels at Berga an der Elster where the Nazi government had a hidden V-2 rocket factory. Berga was a subcamp of the notorious concentration camp Buchenwald. \"These men were abused and put under some of the most horrific conditions,\" the general told a private gathering of Berga survivors. \"It wasn't a prison camp. It was a slave labor camp.\" No ranking Army official had ever uttered the words \"slave labor camp\" in reference to the men's captivity at Berga. Boles knew the gravity of his statement -- that he was setting the historical record straight after 64 years.  Watch general set record straight after six decades » . \"That's why I'm here. That's why the Army sent me here: To look them in the eye and tell them that.\" It's a rare moment to witness history, even more rare when it pertains to America's greatest generation six decades later. But that's what happened at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando, first in a private meeting and then in the larger ceremony to honor them. \"It's humbling,\" Boles said. It was a bittersweet moment. More than 100 of the Berga soldiers died at the slave camp or on a forced death march of more than 200 miles in April 1945. About 80 of the 350 soldiers had been singled out for being Jewish by the Nazis. Dozens more survived captivity but died as the years passed. There are 22 known Berga survivors still alive, but only a handful made the trip here. \"He used that term slave labor camp. That was never used by anyone before,\" said survivor Samuel Fahrer. \"It was a long time coming.\"  See photos inside the camp » . The six Berga survivors present -- Fahrer, 86; Morton Brooks, 83; Sidney Lipson, 85; Peter Iosso, 83; Wallace Carden, 84; and Edward Slotkin, 84 -- looked on stoically as Boles spoke privately with them. The men's faces hid decades of pain from what they endured in the waning months of World War II in 1945. They'd given up decades ago that the Army would recognize them. \"It means a great deal -- that it's being recognized and understood,\" Brooks told the general.   See excerpts from diary inside Berga » . Boles recited a soldier's war ethos: I will always place the mission first; I will never quit; I will never accept defeat and I will never leave a fallen comrade. He looked at each of the weathered war heroes and said, \"Just as they never left their fallen comrades, we will never leave them.\" \"You were good soldiers and you were there for your nation.\" Boles added, \"They're looking around and they're thanking me for coming. And I'm the one thanking them because I get to bask in the character of these great heroes.\" If there was a skeptic coming into the evening, it was Fahrer, a U.S. medic held at Berga. He had dedicated much of his life in the years after the war seeking recognition for the men. He had been outraged that the government in 1948 commuted the death sentences of two Berga commanders, Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz. Fahrer sought for their death sentences to be reinstated.  See document from War Department letting commanders off » . A native of Long Island, New York, the typically talkative Fahrer was rendered nearly speechless as the general spoke. \"After 60 years, I gave up hope a long time ago, and I'm glad you're here with us tonight,\" Fahrer told Boles. Boles said he couldn't speak to why the Berga commanders got off so easy, but he said he knew \"it caused a great deal of pain for these men.\" In modern times, he said, if U.S. soldiers were held at a slave camp in Iraq or Afghanistan, he'd expect justice for those responsible. \"I think full justice is the right word.\" The general even addressed documents that many of the Berga survivors signed before they were sent back home to the States. \"The interests of American prisoners in the event of future wars, moreover, demand that the secrets of this war be vigorously safeguarded,\" it says. The survivors believed the document meant they were never to speak about their Berga experience. \"That was not our intent at all, but we screwed that up,\" Boles said. \"What the intent of the documents was, for those who had been POWs, not to talk about escapes, people who had assisted them, people who had helped them. Our inability to explain that correctly was, therefore, misunderstood by them.\" He added, \"What they went through didn't need to be kept a secret.\" The night would get more special as this evening progressed. The Berga soldiers were honored in front of a gathering of World War II POWs. About 100 veterans and their families packed a banquet hall. Boles told the group what he said in private -- that the men are \"national treasures.\" \"You may wonder if it mattered, if your service and sacrifice made a difference, if it stood the test of time,\" he said. \"You may rest easy. I have seen your service live.\" The room grew quiet. The general, in dress blues, strode to the six Berga survivors and presented each one with the flags flown over the Pentagon. \"Your nation remembers and it salutes each of you,\" Boles said. Each of the elders saluted the general back. The room was then told to stand on orders of the president of the United States. The entire room came to a hushed silence and rose to its feet. Fahrer, the medic who had fought so hard for justice for his Berga comrades, was asked to step forward. And there before the crowd on this historic evening, he was presented with one of the nation's highest honors, the Bronze Star. \"To all who shall see these presents, greeting: this is to certify that the President of the United States of America authorized by executive order, 24 August 1962, has awarded the Bronze Star Medal to Private Samuel Fahrer, Army of the United States, for meritorious achievement while serving with Medical Detachment, 110th Infantry Regiment in the European Theater of Operations on 19 December 1944, in military operations against an armed enemy of the United States.\" He had earned the medal 65 years ago, but due to clerical errors it had never been given to him. Fahrer beamed with pride. He had shed few tears since his time at Berga. But on this night, even Fahrer had trouble containing his emotions. \"I'm not the crying type, but it got me right here,\" he said, his hand over his heart as he searched for words. At long last, the Berga men finally had some comfort. \"It's satisfying that after all this time amends could be made,\" Brooks said. \"When there's talk of the Holocaust, we understand it.\" The general commended CNN for its reporting on the issue in recent months, saying those reports helped change the men's legacy. Boles applauded Reps. Joe Baca, D-California, and Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama, who urged the Army to act to honor the Berga soldiers. At one point Saturday evening, Berga survivor Sidney Lipson pulled me to the side. \"Why did you care so much that we be recognized?\" \"Because you deserved it,\" I replied. He clutched his encased flag, pulled it to his heart and smiled. \"Thank you.\" Note from CNN's Wayne Drash: For Berga survivors who were not able to attend the Orlando event, the Army is working to coordinate events in the men's communities. I also want to thank CNN's audience who lobbied Congress and the Army to give these soldiers recognition.\n\n**News 2**:\n(Oprah.com) -- It came as no surprise to a woman we'll call Joan when, after 16 years of marriage, she and her husband started discussing the possibility of divorce. Deep down she'd never believed her marriage, or any marriage, could be genuinely happy. Still, the reality was crushing. \"I was desperate,\" she says. \"I thought, 'I'd do anything to feel better.'\" How about singing every day, making lists of things that made her happy, and getting a \"joy buddy\"? Those are among the suggestions given in Awakening Joy, a class taught by James Baraz, a meditation instructor and founding teacher of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California. A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives. Like some participants, Joan, who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock, initially balked at the idea of singing. \"I thought James wanted me to join a choir,\" she says, \"but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work.\" So she started trilling along with the \"Hairspray\" soundtrack while driving. \"It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most.\" \"The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,\" says Baraz. \"In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good.\" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy. Robert Holden, Ph.D., author of \"Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast\" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. \"Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for. If you focus on happiness, that's what you become more aware of.\" Once participants have made up their minds to be happier, Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind. Among them: . • Writing what the word joy means to you . • Doing some form of physical movement -- such as yoga, dance, or walking -- a few times a week . • Making a \"nourishment list\" of activities you enjoy, checking off those you do regularly and circling the ones that could be done more often . • Checking in with your \"joy buddy,\" a kind of running partner in the pursuit of happiness. \"That's important,\" says Holden. \"One of the major blocks to happiness is a sense of isolation. If you're alive, you need help.\" There are also guided meditations, including instructions on how to be mindful --being present for whatever you're doing and, as Baraz says, \"simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different.\" For Joan, that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process. \"Awakening Joy isn't about being a happy little do bee,\" she says. \"You're taught that when feelings arise, no matter what they are, you stay with them. When my husband said we should contact a mediator, I cried years of tears. But by accepting those painful feelings, I had a watershed moment: I realized that I really wanted this marriage.\" Rather than assuming divorce was inevitable, Joan started to see other possibilities. \"From that day to this, it's been a whole different experience,\" she says. \"My husband and I are still together, and in a way that I honestly didn't think was possible.\" For Baraz, the best testimonials come from former skeptics; he admits that he himself wouldn't be the best case study. \"I've always been a relatively joyful, celebratory kind of person,\" he says. He found his spiritual path in Buddhism, but when his studies became very serious, so did he. \"Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One, and he said, 'Go for the highest happiness.' That became the focus of my teaching.\" (Baraz points out that one needn't be a Buddhist, or of any particular faith, to reap the benefits of Awakening Joy. \"Ministers, rabbis, and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles,\" he says.) The idea for the course began eight years ago, when Baraz's wife, Jane, gave him a book called \"How We Choose to Be Happy,\" by Rick Foster and Greg Hicks. \"The instructions made a lot of sense, but they didn't have a spiritual dimension,\" Baraz says. \"So I added that and presented it as a series of talks with my weekly meditation group for about three months to see what would happen.\" The results: \"We got happier and happier!\" Baraz then turned Awakening Joy into a six-month class and found that participants maintained a positive attitude even after it ended (as long as they practiced the exercises; as with diets or working out, continuity is essential). Word of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread: The first round of Awakening Joy meetings consisted of about 40 members. The next numbered 100; the next, 200, and then 500. It went international when its members began e-mailing their monthly homework assignments from the lectures to friends. Baraz was thrilled to receive messages from strangers in Europe, Africa, and New Zealand. \"It works!\" they wrote. Apparently, you didn't have to be there to get the joy. Nor do you have to be the type who can deftly turn a frown upside down. \"I'm the person who walks into a nicely designed room and notices only that the painting was hung too high,\" says Gretchen, age 56. In addition to being a \"serious\" woman from a depressive family, Gretchen also found herself in chronic pain after sustaining a back injury. \"It was horrible,\" she recalls. \"Medication made me sick. I felt guilty about not being able to work, and I thought people were judging me.\" Though a specialist was able to alleviate some of her physical discomfort, Gretchen fell into a deep depression. She heard about Awakening Joy after taking Baraz's meditation classes at Spirit Rock. \"The first thing I was hit by was the instruction to notice what it feels like when you're happy,\" she says. \"I loved the walks I took to help my back, but before, I just plodded down the street, not noticing anything. Now I'm aware of how I feel when I'm walking, which enhances my enjoyment.\" Writing lists of things she's grateful for was also a big help. \"A lot of my seriousness has lifted,\" she says. \"I have a lighter heart. I still have chronic pain, but I know there's a lot to feel good about.\" Baraz is writing a book about Awakening Joy and the people who now routinely roll up the windows in their cars so they can sing as loudly as they want to. \"More than 2,000 people have tested it, so it's not some airy-fairy idea,\" he says. \"I've learned that it's possible to change, no matter what your history or the limiting beliefs you've held on to. If you have the intention to be happy and you do the practices, if you give it your best shot and are very patient, it works.\" We're all so used to thinking that we'll finally be content when we find the perfect partner, lose weight, or get our dream job. Is it really possible to become happier just by deciding you can? \"We use the language of having, getting, and chasing to describe happiness, rather than being,\" says Holden. \"What we've learned about happiness is that it isn't an it or a thing. Research has proven that there is no one set of circumstances that makes someone happy; it's more about having a healthy mental attitude toward whatever you're experiencing. So, you can either chase happiness or you can choose to be happy. It really is that simple.\" By Suzan Colón from \"O, The Oprah Magazine,\" January 2008.  E-mail to a friend .

{"tokens_range": "4k", "total_prompt_tokens": 3740, "how_many_news": 2, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\nLONDON, England (CNN) -- In 1981, Dr Mohga Kamal-Yanni was preparing to leave Egypt for a clinical attachment in England when her father had a heart attack. He fell in the street, and was taken to a public hospital, where Dr Kamal-Yanni kept vigil at his bedside until he regained his strength. A doctor at a hospital in India where health indicators have showed no significant improvement  in seven years. During his stay in the hospital, she was appalled at the low level of healthcare available to him. \"It was awful. There was no medicine,\" she told CNN. As a doctor, Kamal-Yanni was able to watch over her father's progress. Her professional opinion on his recovery was striking. \"My father survived that heart attack for two reasons,\" she said. \"One, because of God's will, and two, because he had a strong will. It was nothing to do with the health service.\" The following year, Kamal-Yanni came to England to do a clinical attachment. She found herself deeply affected by the stark contrast between the healthcare available in Britain, on the publicly funded National Health Service, and the healthcare available at home in Egypt. She found herself slipping into depression. \"I couldn't talk to the patients; I couldn't talk to the doctors. I just couldn't cope with it,\" she revealed to CNN. \"I couldn't understand why every time I saw a monitor next to a patient I was so upset.\" It dawned on her that the gulf in care was troubling her. \"I kept thinking why on earth my dad didn't have that. The only reason was that he happened to be born in Egypt and these people had the luck to be born [in England].\" Kamal-Yanni is now a senior health & HIV policy advisor at third-world charity Oxfam. Her first-hand experience of the divide between the healthcare available in richer countries, and that on offer in poorer ones, has given her the impetus to try and narrow the gap. While Western countries are pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, discovering the potential of nanotechnology and other high-tech solutions to the developed world's diseases, like diabetes, cancer and obesity, poor countries are struggling to combat health problems such as HIV, malaria and TB. Lack of infrastructure . And it's not as simple as shipping medicines and supplies in bulk quantities. Oxfam's \"Paying for People\" report, published in February this year, said that poor countries are suffering because they lack the infrastructure of a health service. The WHO's 2006 \"World Health Report\" also indicates that 4.25 million doctors, nurses and health workers are needed across 57 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has 600,000 health workers: one million more are required. Without these key workers, it is questionable whether healthcare in poor countries can be improved. Nicky Wimble, a spokesperson for Oxfam, told CNN, \"There is money coming in for drugs now, but there's no commitment to long-term aid.\" Governments are unable to give healthcare workers with job security and doctors and nurses, where they do exist, are largely poorly paid: so people choose other careers. \"They're either becoming taxi drivers, or working for private businesses,\" Wimble says. This double brain-drain (one internal, one external as those who do train are tempted away by higher salaries and brighter futures in developed countries) means that even if drugs make it to poorer areas, there can be no one to administer them. \"Drugs are sitting in cupboards,\" Wimble told CNN. \"Or they're available in cities but people in rural areas don't have the bus fares to get to them.\" Vulnerable to disease . Dr Kamal-Yanni backs this up. She told CNN, \"There is no public investment in health systems so people have to pay for it. If you're poor you can't buy your healthcare and if you're a woman who happens to be poor you might as well forget it.\" And in countries where no healthcare system exists, people are extremely vulnerable to diseases, which can spread rampantly and unchecked through communities. Dr Kamal-Yanni paints a worrying picture. \"Particularly in Africa, they're not equipped to face anything -- not HIV, let alone avian flu. If something like avian flu hit Africa with no health system, no health workers and no money, it would spread. We can't contain it in Africa. The world would wake up and realize that, but in the meantime, it would have wiped out goodness knows how many millions of people.\" It's not just in Africa. HIV is a known crisis there, but it is anticipated that more people will be infected in India than anywhere else, as the disease spreads quickly through its billion-strong population. Increasingly, countries like these are having to deal with a boom in incommunicable diseases, like diabetes and cancer. Chronic diseases like diabetes have the additional problem that they require long-term care, and therefore long-term funding. Dr Kamal-Yanni explained the difficulties of that situation. \"You buy the pills today, but maybe tomorrow you don't have enough money so you're never cured and develop complications.\" What lies ahead? Dr Kamal-Yanni sees three possible outcomes for health in poor countries. The first, as she explained, is bleak. She told CNN, \"If things continue as they are, with rising infection, increasing resistance to drugs, HIV and malaria run unchecked, chronic and non-communicable diseases are ignored and no money is spent on a health system, then the gap will just increase and the situation will get worse and worse.\" Dr Kamal-Yanni is hopeful, however, that the situation will improve somewhat. She explained a second scenario, the one she feels is most likely to happen. \"If the international community invests a little bit, things will be slightly better,\" she told CNN. \"More people with HIV will get treatment, as will people with TB and malaria. But non-communicable chronic diseases [like diabetes] will be ignored.\" But large-scale epidemics like avian flu or SARS would still remain a huge threat in this scenario, as would diseases like cancer. \"Who's going to pay for medicine for cancer, which is increasing like anything in developing countries?\" asks Dr Kamal-Yanni. \"Nobody.\" Hope for the future . But there is a third scenario, which holds out more hope for people in developing countries. Dr Kamal-Yanni says, \"If public pressure is high, southern governments, donors and the international community will decide that health is really a priority. We'll put our money where our mouth is and we'll fulfil the commitments that we've made before.\" She says that in the first instance, African countries need to be encouraged to divert 16 percent of their budget to health. (Currently, nearly a third allocate less than five percent.) \"Then they will realize that this is not enough, so they'll put in more,\" she continues. If this money were to be added to the $50 billion promised by G8, the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations, in Gleneagles in 2005, it would have a huge impact on health and education, particularly in Africa. And education is the key, Dr Kamal-Yanni believes. She explained, \"You can't separate health and education because unless you educate doctors and nurses, and midwives and pharmacists, you can't run a health service.\" Working together . It's also important for donors and governments to work together to provide a cohesive service, she says. \"They really need to start coordinating their work so it's not a series of vertical programs that don't relate to each other and waste resources.\" Oxfam's Nicky Wimble agrees. She told CNN, \"Over the last 100 years, countries like France, Britain and America have developed by giving their people free education and healthcare. It's a major way to bring people out of poverty.\" Wimble cites the example of education, where the number of children not in school worldwide has fallen from around 120 million to around 80 million. \"The key is getting governments to commit to it as a part of their aid package, and monitoring the aid package so that the money is tracked to ensure that it gets to where it's intended,\" she said. \"It's working for education, and they think it'll work for healthcare too, but it needs committed investment.\" And in the meantime, people like Mohga Kamal-Yanni will continue their work to pressure governments to encourage positive change. She says, \"That's my motivation to do this work. It's not for me; it's a life thing. My dream in life is for everybody in Africa to have access to a publicly financed, publicly run healthcare service with strong regulation, quality, care and equity.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\n**News 2**:\nLONDON, England (CNN) -- As the saying goes, \"Pain is temporary, film is forever\" and noone in the movie business knows this better than stuntmen. Stunt double Terry Leonard performs a hazardous jump from horseback to a truck as Indiana Jones in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Hollywood's athletes regularly defy death in pursuit of ever more extreme spectacles to keep us on the edge our cinema seats. \"The Screening Room\" takes a look at some of the best stunts ever pulled off -- and a few that didn't end so well. Don't agree with the list? Think we've missed one? Tell us in the SoundOff box below. 1. \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" (Charles Reisner, 1928) Stunt: Building falls down  Stuntman: Buster Keaton . Charlie Chaplin may be better remembered, but no early stuntman was more willing to risk eternal oblivion for a great stunt than Keaton. In perhaps his most perfect stunt, the side of a building crashes down on top of him and Keaton is saved only by an open window that fits neatly around him. The window was built to have clearance of two inches around each shoulder and on the top of his head. As Keaton himself said, \"You don't do these things twice.\" 2. \"Stagecoach\" (John Ford, 1939)   Stunt: High speed stagecoach jump  Stuntman: Yakima Canutt . Ex-rodeo cowboy Yakima Canutt was probably the first celebrity stuntman, best known as a stunt double for John Wayne. In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach. 3. \"Ben Hur\" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt . Canutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on. The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured. 4. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Stephen Spielberg, 1981)   Stunt: Truck drag  Stuntman: Terry Leonard . This intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck. A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver. Harrison Ford, an accomplished stuntman in his own right, performed an earlier portion of the sequence, where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament. 5. \"GoldenEye\" (Martin Campbell, 1995)   Stunt: 750 foot bungee jump  Stuntman: Wayne Michaels . This breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take. Michaels jumped from a specially-constructed platform built to jut out from the dam to prevent him making contact with the front of the dam, which was studded with steel pegs. This, combined with his high falling velocity, could have proved fatal. 6. \"Who am I?\" (Wo shi shei) (Jackie Chan, 1998) Stunt: 21-storey slide  Stuntman: Jackie Chan . It's almost impossible to choose just one of Chan's stunts, but his faintly slapstick 21-storey slide down the side of a skyscraper is pretty impressive -- even more so when you find out he did it without a harness. He never uses stunt doubles or special effects and as a result has broken just about every bone in his body over the years. Now that's commitment. 7. \"Sharky's Machine\" (Burt Reynolds, 1981)   Stunt: Free-fall jump  Stuntman: Dar Robinson . At 220 feet, legendary stuntman Dar Robinson's jump from Atlanta's Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel remains the highest free-fall stunt ever performed from a building for a commercially-released film. Ironically, despite it being a record-breaking fall, moviegoers only see the briefest moment of the actual stunt in the film. The rest of the fall from the skyscraper is disappointingly a dummy. 8. \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (George Roy Hill, 1969) Stunt: Cliff Leap  Stuntmen: Mickey Gilbert/Howard Curtis . Trapped by the Superposse, Butch and Sundance leap from the top of a cliff into the boiling waters of a river below. It's set up nicely with some humorous dialogue: \"I can't swim.\" \"Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill you!\" Robert Redford and Paul Newman did jump off the cliff, but landed on a ledge with a mattress about six feet below. The stuntmen jumped off a construction crane at a studio lot obscured by a painting of the cliffs. 9. \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (James Cameron, 1991)  Stunt: Motorcycle jump  Stuntman: Peter Kent . Stuntman Peter Kent's resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger was the basis of a 14-year association with the ex-action hero. As Schwarzenegger's stunt double he performed the T-101's famous motorbike jump into a massive storm drain. To get the effect, his motorbike was rigged up to a web of one-inch cables, to cut the impact when the bike and rider hit the ground. The cables were later digitally erased. 10. \"Deathproof\" (Quentin Tarantino, 2007) Stunt: Car chase on bonnet  Stuntwoman: Zoë Bell . Bell won an award at the Oscars of the stunt world, the Taurus stunt awards, for this daredevil action piece. She clings precariously to the bonnet of a car going at 85 miles per hour while receiving hits from a second car in a long, climactic chase scene. Bell is a stuntwoman by trade but it's easy to see why Tarantino flouted the unspoken Hollywood convention that stuntmen stay out of the limelight and cast her as the film's lead. And five tragic stunts that didn't come off ... Stunts are a dangerous business, and it doesn't always work out. We pay tribute to five brave stunt men and women who fell in the line of duty. 1. \"Top Gun\" (Tony Scott,1986) Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl died during the making of \"Top Gun\" in 1985 after his plane never recovered from a flat spin and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. 2. \"The Crow\" (Alex Proyas,1994) Martial arts legend Bruce Lee's son Brandon was shot and killed during a stunt shooting sequence, when the cap of a blank accidentally penetrated his abdomen and lodged in his spine. 3. \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\" (Joe Dante/John Landis, 1983) Actor Vic Morrow and child actors Renee Chen and My-ca Dinh Le were instantly killed when a special-effects explosion caused a helicopter to spin out of control and crash down on top of them. 4. \"Cannonball Run\" (Hal Needham, 1981) Stuntwoman Heidi Von Beltz was paralysed from the neck down when her sports car crashed head on into a van during a stunt on the set of the film. 5. \"Armour of God\" (Jackie Chan, 1987) Chan fell 15 feet while jumping from a wall to a tree branch. He landed hard on his head, causing part of his skull to crack and lodge in his brain. He required major surgery and now has a permanent hole in his head which is filled by a plastic plug."}

CEO David O'Reilly says Big Oil is not to blame for skyrocketing gas prices. Chevron Corp. CEO David O'Reilly says world demand for crude oil has been growing, which is affecting gas prices. In an interview Tuesday with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" O'Reilly said high demand and a short supply of crude oil were key factors causing gas prices to spike. Despite reports of record profits among major oil companies, O'Reilly downplayed a recent poll in which Americans said corporate avarice played a role. O'Reilly also discussed President Bush's and GOP presumptive presidential nominee Sen. John McCain's proposal to lift the ban on new offshore drilling as well as presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama's call for taxing companies' windfall profits. The following is an edited version of the show's transcript: . Blitzer: You know you have -- you and ExxonMobil, the Big Oil companies --have a huge public relations problem. In all the recent polls, when the American public is asked, who do you blame for these huge gas prices at the pump, they -- more than any other single source -- they blame Big Oil. They blame you. What's going on?  Watch Blitzer grill O'Reilly » . O'Reilly: Well, I don't think they blame us as much as you think. It looks to me like there's a lot of blame to go around. Blitzer: There's other blame, but more than any other single source, they blame Big Oil. O'Reilly: It depends on the poll you look at. Blitzer: The recent Gallup Poll. O'Reilly: Let me point out what we're trying to do about this because I think the issue here is one of supply. And prices are high today, but it's fundamentally a concern about oil supplies -- 75 percent of the price of gasoline is related to crude oil. We're very dependent on crude oil imports. The total world demand for crude oil has been growing steadily over the last decade. And that is affecting everybody's price. So it is a concern, but we need to work on the supply side, as well as the demand side, to bring change. Blitzer: Because you have had record profits, right? O'Reilly: We're investing those record profits. Blitzer: But billions and billions of dollars in profits, more than ever before. O'Reilly: Yes, but it's a big business. And on a return-on-sales business, we're right in there with the average of American business today. What we're doing is investing that money. For example, last year, we did make a lot of money, $18.7 billion. This year, our capital investment in new supplies is $22.9 billion, almost $23 billion. Blitzer: You know that Barack Obama says if he's president, he wants a windfall profits tax. He wants to take a chunk of your profits right now and give it back to the American people. John McCain opposes that, as you know. So I assume you would like to see John McCain elected president?  Watch McCain explain his stance » . O'Reilly: Well, I would like to see no windfall profit tax. And I will tell you why. First of all, we are already heavily taxed as an industry. Our tax rates last year were at 45 percent, compared with in the 30s for the average of all industry. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we're investing the money. If you take the money away, it will reduce investment, reduce supply and have exactly the opposite effect of helping the problem that you have referred to. And, thirdly, we have done it before. We have had windfall profit taxes. Congress has studied them about 30 years ago. And what happened under those circumstances is supplies dropped domestically, and we became even more dependent on imported oil. You don't want to do that today. Blitzer: Here's how Sen. Obama put it. Listen to this. Obama (in a video clip): Sen. McCain wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to Big Oil and opposes a windfall profits tax on oil companies like Exxon to help families struggling with high energy costs. I think that is exactly why we need to change Washington. Blitzer: So, I guess, given the stark difference when it comes to Big Oil between Obama and McCain -- let me rephrase the question -- do you want McCain to be elected? O'Reilly: I want someone to be elected who will help resolve our energy crisis. And I don't know enough about Sen. Obama's position or Sen. McCain's position to pass judgment on either one of them. What I do know, though, is that if we want to solve this problem of high energy prices, we're going to have to work not only in the demand side, as Congress has done with [Corporate Average Fuel Economy] standards and alternatives, but we're going to have to work on the supply as well. Blitzer: Do you want offshore drilling to be approved on both coasts and in the Gulf, which Sen. McCain now says is a good idea? O'Reilly: I do think that's a good idea. Today, our shores, except for the gulf off Texas and Mississippi and so forth, are off-limits today. So, look, Europeans who are very environmentally conscious -- the British, the Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch -- they can allow sensible offshore production from their oceans. Why can't we?  See where drilling is allowed, banned » . Since we have -- over the last 20 years, domestic production has steadily declined -- and we have been more and more dependent on imports. We definitely need to do something about it. We don't know yet how much oil is under there, but we should at least be given the opportunity to look. Blitzer: We invited our viewers to ask you a question, and some of the I-Reports came in. iReport.com: See what iReporters are saying about gas prices . Unidentified male (in a video clip): If you would had told me a year ago that gas prices were going to reach about $4 a gallon, I wouldn't have doubted you. And if you had told me the year before that that they would reach $3 a gallon, I still wouldn't have doubted you. So what should Americans expect in terms of pricing of gas in the future? Blitzer: What do you think? O'Reilly: Very good question. I mean, $4 gasoline is a reality today because ... Blitzer: In some parts of the country, it's approaching $5. O'Reilly: Well, 75 percent of that is the price of crude oil. And that is the crude oil that we have been talking about here that's driving the current crude oil -- energy market. Blitzer: So, how high is it going to go? O'Reilly: Well, if crude oil prices come down, I think those prices could moderate. But it's a big if. Crude oil prices have to come down. We need to send a very strong signal to the market that we're serious about increasing supplies in this country. Blitzer: Do you think manipulators, stock manipulators, are paying -- are doing things to cause this spiral? O'Reilly: I don't know enough about the financial markets. We're a physical player. But I think most of the price that we see today is because of concern about physical long-term supply. Blitzer: Just because of the huge demand in India and China, also? O'Reilly: Huge demand around the globe, including here in the United States. Blitzer: Here's another question. Unidentified male (in a video clip): Have we reached peak oil supply? And, if not, when do you expect that we will? And, once we do, when do you expect that the prices of gas will go down to a reasonable level? O'Reilly: You know, peak oil is a big question today, and it's a very good question. One of the issues that we face has been addressed -- around people -- has been addressed to the National Petroleum Council study, which was issued last year by the secretary of energy. It is a very important study. What it really says is, there's enough oil and gas in the ground, but the access is what's impeding production. So, we could have a squeeze in the years ahead if we don't get after increasing our supplies, not only here in the U.S., but creating a global environment which permits access around the globe and free trade around the globe as far as oil is concerned.\n\n**News 2**:\nLAVONIA, Georgia (CNN) -- Sonya Savage's back door opens to a cozy wooden porch that serves as a shelter for her 9-year-old son's bicycles and spare parts. Residents of Beaver Creek in Lavonia, Georgia, say they had no idea a neighbor was holding his family captive. A 30-foot tract of red clay and splotchy crab grass separates her mobile home from the home of Raymond Daniel Thurmond, a residence so rank and squalid that it forced a seasoned police investigator to vomit upon entering. Another officer donned a gas mask just to walk inside. Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years. \"My son, he's a little bicycle mechanic. He's always in the backyard, and he don't recall ever seeing nobody over here,\" said Savage, 29, who also has a 4-year-old daughter. \"Usually I've got a yard full of kids, but I've never seen any of those kids come out and play.\" Savage recalls speaking to Thurmond once, after someone stole one of her son's bike tires. Thurmond kindly told Savage he hadn't seen anything suspicious. \"He was nice, polite, seemed like a normal guy,\" she said.  Watch a walk-through of the filth » . Alma Medina, the property manager for the 100-unit Beaver Creek mobile home park, lives three doors from what is now a crime scene. She remembers Thurmond was a polite fellow. He always called her \"Miss Alma\" when he dropped by the office to explain that his rent was late, a routine occurrence that eventually led Medina's maintenance man to a foul discovery. She occasionally saw Thurmond mingling with other tenants, but she never saw his family. The only indication that one existed, Medina said, was that he and his wife both signed a lease August 22, 2005, and noted on their application that they had three sons and a daughter. \"I never saw them outside, never,\" she said.  See what the trailer looked like » . Lavonia, a city of about 2,000 on Interstate 85, about five miles from South Carolina and the sprawling Lake Hartwell, is not the best place to keep secrets. The locals know each other, if only by face, and the police chief personally directs school traffic and walks the entire town daily to check on local businesses. The self-professed \"big-time small town\" has its share of crime, but hasn't seen a murder in six years. Lt. Missy Collins, the investigator who had Thurmond arrested Tuesday after a two-week investigation, said her husband used to work with Thurmond at a pump-manufacturing facility in nearby Toccoa. Chief Bruce Carlisle remembers seeing the burly 6-foot-4 Thurmond around town, at hardware and grocery stores. He generally wore shorts, work boots and a tank top or sleeveless shirt. Carlisle and Thurmond weren't acquainted, but the chief heard he was always cordial. \"You never saw anybody with him,\" the chief said. Authorities never had a problem with Thurmond until August 4, when Collins received a call from a women's shelter. \"They said they had a mother and four kids, and apparently they'd been kept at home, and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldn't let them leave,\" Collins said. Collins interviewed the women and children, who all gave the same story: Thurmond had forced the wife, three sons (9, 13 and 14 years old) and his 12-year-old daughter to remain inside. Police are still investigating how. Medina on Wednesday provided CNN a tour of the trailer that revealed a hasp, used to secure a door with a padlock, that had been fastened to the mobile home's back door. Holes on the inside of the front door and on one of the children's bedroom doors indicate hasps had been placed there as well, Medina said. Collins said police are not sure if padlocks were the only way Thurmond imprisoned his family. There is no indication Thurmond had any accomplices, but he was prone to bouts of rage. Collins said Thurmond had once allegedly raped his wife with the children in the next room.  Watch Collins explain how Thurmond instilled fear » . \"The entire family lived in fear of this man,\" the investigator said. \"Just his presence alone was enough for them to comply.\" They had never left the trailer except for a few hours in April, when Thurmond allowed them to visit his in-laws in North Carolina. Collins said the wife's parents had been sending the family money and threatened to cease sending cash if their daughter and grandchildren didn't visit. The wife's mother answered the phone Wednesday, but said she had been told not to speak to the media. It is unclear by whom. Her parents' names are being withheld to protect the woman's identity. Collins said she is not certain exactly what emboldened the family to flee the filthy trailer, but the mother told police that Thurmond had said he was leaving her for another woman. He'd be back in a few days, he told her, and he'd left some food for them, Collins said. The food was insufficient, Collins said, but she is not sure if it was hunger or ire over the mistress that provided the impetus to leave -- \"only the mother could really tell you why.\" When Collins interviewed the family, all but one of the children were pale and thin, she said. Only one, the 14-year-old, had ever attended school, and though the mother said the other children were home-schooled, the children told Collins that Thurmond wouldn't buy them school supplies. When Collins visited the home, the only educational implement she found was an old dictionary, she said. After interviewing the family, Collins launched a manhunt that ended without incident Tuesday at Thurmond's workplace, a poultry processing plant in neighboring Stephens County. About the time Collins kicked off her hunt for Thurmond, Medina was growing frustrated that he hadn't paid his rent. On August 6, after Thurmond hadn't responded to a notice on his door threatening eviction, Medina sent her maintenance man to the mobile home. He returned disturbed and told Medina he hadn't entered the home, she said. \"I want you to see this with your own eyes,\" she recalled the maintenance worker telling her. \"You better wear some shoes and gloves or something.\" The kitchen floor was rotted. Heavy, brown stains covered both toilets. There were anthills under a mattress in the master bedroom. Roaches freely roamed the inside of the refrigerator, and maggots owned the stove. There were several piles of trash, including one reaching the laundry room ceiling and a mound of Diet Mountain Dew bottles between a recliner and the living room couch. Tufts of human hair were scattered on the kitchen floor among bags of fetid trash.  Watch how the home remained squalid after a week of cleaning » . Collins said she went behind an adjacent mobile home and vomited when she and another officer first opened the door. This was after the windows had been opened to air out the residence. Collins said she had never experienced such a stench -- this from a police investigator who as recently as last week rode in an ambulance with a corpse that had been pulled from a burning building. When Collins went in the bathroom and pulled back the once-clear-but-now-chocolate-brown shower curtain, it revealed so many roaches that the bathtub floor appeared to be moving. On Wednesday, after a week of cleaning that has already yielded two Dumpsters of trash, dozens of roaches still scurried across the floor and walls. A stench still lingered, and a film of bug feces covered the kitchen counters. Medina said she has to gut the entire trailer and replace the floor, walls and ceiling before she can rent it again. Collins said rebuilding the family may take more work. As of Thursday morning, Thurmond still didn't have an attorney and no bail hearing had been set, Collins said. In an interrogation after his arrest, Thurmond seemed \"even-tempered\" and didn't behave like someone being charged with rape and a host of other felonies, Collins said. Though he was not forthcoming and admitted nothing during the interview, Collins said, one aspect of his behavior stoked her suspicion. \"If I had been arrested and hadn't done anything, my first reaction would be, 'Where's my wife and kids?' \" Collins said. \"He didn't even ask until he was behind bars.\""}

Or that crowds make for long food lines or the tickets may be hard to come by. Bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding performed at this year's New Orleans Jazz Fest. Music festivals worldwide attract thousands of fans wanting to hear their favorite artists live or discover under-the-radar musicians. Each major festival has its own special twist, specific to the event and city that hosts it. From the notorious mud baths at Glastonbury, England, to the breath-taking mountains surrounding Fuji Rock in Naeba, Japan, these are events that festival-goers wait for all year.  Experience the New Orleans Jazz Fest » . Our guide prepares music fans worldwide for the best festivals this summer and later in the year. GLASTONBURY, Somerset, England June 24-28 ($255) Glastonbury has been around since dairy farmer Michael Eavis first held a free two-day festival on his farm in 1970, and it's long been the festival in England for seeing the biggest and best bands in the world. It also may be the muddiest -- heavy rain in several years, most notably 1997, turned Glastonbury into a muddy bog. Everyone from Radiohead to Jay-Z has headlined the festival, and with more than 700 acts each year, there is something for everybody. Some of the proceeds from the festival go to Oxfam and Greenpeace. This year's headliners include Franz Ferdinand, Blur, and Bruce Springsteen. ROCK AL PARQUE, Bogota, Colombia June 27-29 (free) The Rock al Parque festival, launched in 1995, has become South America's biggest rockfest in recent years -- some 320,000 people traveled to Simon Bolivar Park in 2006 for a weekend of Colombia's top rock bands and renowned international headliners. Funded by Colombia's culture secretary, the free festival has included some of rock's biggest names, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Manu Chao, and Bloc Party. In the days leading up to Rock al Parque, the festival organizers host a series of panel discussions on music production, management, and the recording industry. ROSKILDE, Denmark July 2-5 ($220) Since 1971, the rock festival in Roskilde has hosted the top names in music, from Bob Marley to Bob Dylan. It is the biggest summer festival in northern Europe, and the \"Arena\" stage boasts a 17,000-capacity tent, the largest in Europe. The festival has a daily newspaper and a 24-hour live radio station and is also home to the annual \"Naked Run,\" where the first naked person to cross the finish line receives a free ticket for next year's festival. Some 80,000 will travel to Roskilde to see headliners including Coldplay, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails. EXIT, Novi Sad, Serbia July 9-12 ($105) Created in 2000 by three university students as a protest against former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, the electro-focused festival in the heart of Serbia was named Europe's best festival in 2007 by fans voting in the UK Festival Awards. Over 200,000 people attended Exit last year, dancing at all-night raves in the gorgeous surroundings of Petrovaradin Fortress, an 18th-century castle near the Danube River. Some of techno's biggest names will be on hand to celebrate Exit's 10-year anniversary, including Moby, Kraftwerk, and The Prodigy. THISDAY, Abuja/Lagos, Nigeria Dates tba . The THISDAY festival in Nigeria -- launched in 2006 by the editor-in-chief of Thisday newspaper, Nduka Obaigbena, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the end of slavery -- is the biggest music and fashion festival in Africa. According to Obaigbena, the festival is meant to highlight the positive progress being made in Africa, and find sustainable solutions for the continent's problems. The theme of last year's festival was \"Africa Rising,\" and it showcased some of the world's best-known artists including Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Usher. Stay tuned for this year's lineup. FUJI ROCK, Naeba, Japan July 24-26 ($410) Japan's biggest outdoor festival takes its name from Mt. Fuji, the site of the first festival in 1997. Fuji Rock has been set amongst the cool forested mountains of the Naeba ski resort for the past ten years -- gondolas and hilly trails transport people from stage to stage, and the streams and forests between them are the reason why Fuji Rock has been called the most beautiful festival in the world. It's not just about the scenery, though -- over 100,000 people will trek through the mountains to see headliners Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, and Weezer. LOLLAPALOOZA, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. August 7-9 ($190) Rocker Perry Farrell began Lollapalooza in 1991 as a farewell tour for his band, Jane's Addiction. The biggest grunge rock festival during the '90s disappeared for awhile around the turn of the century, but it was revived in 2005 as a more traditional \"big weekend\" destination festival in Chicago. The past few years at Grant Park have been marked by hot summers, huge crowds, and even bigger bands. The anticipated crowd of nearly 200,000 is staggering, as are this year's headliners: Kings of Leon, Tool, Depeche Mode, and Beastie Boys, just to name a few. BESTIVAL, Isle of Wight, England September 11-13 ($205) The trendy Bestival, the original boutique weekend festival on the Isle of Wight, is the best way to end the summer festival season in Europe. Bestival boasts a yearly fancy dress competition -- last year's was \"30,000 freaks under the sea,\" and 2009 is the year of \"Outer Space,\" so make sure to dress accordingly. Thousands of Bestival-goers will witness an eclectic lineup including Lily Allen, Massive Attack, and MGMT in the picturesque surroundings of Robin Hill Park. For family fun, look no further than Camp Bestival, a three-day family festival at a castle by the sea in July. PARKLIFE, Australia Late September-Early October . The Parklife series of one-day music festivals kicks off the summer festival season across Australia. The dance-focused fests have featured heavyweights Justice, MIA, and Muscles over the past two years. The day-long festivals are followed by an official \"After Life\" party that runs until the early hours of the morning, so be prepared for a long one if you're one of the estimated 100,000 people attending a Parklife gig in one of several cities across Australia at the end of September. WOODSTOCK, Johannesburg, South Africa November 27-30  When people think of Woodstock, South Africa isn't necessarily what comes to mind. But for the past decade, the festival has been the biggest youth music event in that country, hosting a variety of both well-known and upcoming mainstream and hip-hop acts -- not to mention a variety of extreme sports stunt acts, paintballing, and flea-market stalls. Woodstock may not have the star power of the legendary American festival -- but with the wide range of music and outdoor activities it presents, its promoters aren't lying when they say that boredom simply isn't an option. SUNBURN, Goa, India  December . Sunburn Festival launched in December 2007 as South Asia's first electronic music festival, and featured heavyweights like Carl Cox and John 00 Fleming. Located seaside in Goa, on India's west coast, the festival has its roots in \"Goa Trance,\" a type of pulsing, transcendental electro music that became popular in the early 1990s. Sunburn again treated more than 5,000 electro revelers to a three-day party by the beach in December 2008. The festival's founder has said Sunburn will always be free to attend, and it is not to be missed if you happen to be in India in December."}
{"tokens_range": "4k", "total_prompt_tokens": 3775, "how_many_news": 2, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Questions surrounding Judge Sonia Sotomayor's past speeches generated more controversy in the final day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Thursday, as Democrats again called her a mainstream jurist and Republicans portrayed her as a liberal activist likely to legislate from the bench. Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor greets Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Thursday. One GOP senator said Sotomayor's most controversial speeches \"bug the hell out of me,\" an expression of frustration as Republicans tried -- with little success -- to get Sotomayor to reveal more about her personal views in her fourth and final day of questioning. GOP critics also summoned New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, who was the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case in Sotomayor's appellate career. Ricci testified that her 2008 rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system. In a potential sign of Sotomayor's strong political momentum, however, Senate Republicans indicated they do not intend to filibuster her nomination on the Senate floor. They also indicated their belief that the full Senate would vote on her nomination before breaking for its August recess. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said he plans to put a confirmation vote for Sotomayor on the committee's calendar for next Tuesday. The committee's questions once again touched on a range of hot-button issues, including gun control, abortion, same-sex marriage, the death penalty, and the role of international law in American jurisprudence. \"I think you're a walking, talking example of the best part of the United States of America,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, told Sotomayor. \"It is my belief that you are going to be a great Supreme Court justice.\" South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham was less complimentary, telling Sotomayor that she has \"said some things that have bugged the hell out of me,\" but he quickly conceded that her judicial record has \"been generally in the mainstream.\" \"Your speeches are disturbing, particularly to conservatives,\" Graham said. \"Those speeches to me suggested gender and racial affiliations in a way that a lot of us wonder, will you take that line of thinking to the Supreme Court in these cases of first precedent.\" But, Graham conceded, \"to be honest with you, your record as a judge has not been radical by any means. ... You have, I think, consistently, as an advocate, took a point of view that was left of center.\" Graham defended the importance of probing Sotomayor's political beliefs by highlighting the high court's 1955 landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which mandated the desegregation of schools. The ruling was \"instructive in the sense that the court pushed the country to do something politicians were not brave enough to do,\" he said.  Watch Graham talk about Sotomayor's record » . The personal views of Supreme Court justices matter, he argued, because \"you're not going to find a law book that tells you\" how to rule on contentious social issues such as same-sex marriage or whether there is a \"fundamental\" right to bear arms. Sotomayor later fired back at the Republican line of questioning, asking Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, if he wanted a judge who pre-decided cases before hearing the evidence and facts.  Watch Sotomayor's record on discrimination » . \"Would you want a judge or nominee who came in here and said, 'I agree with you, this is unconstitutional,' before I had a case before me?\" Sotomayor said, adding: \"I don't think that's a justice I can be.\" She noted that the Supreme Court spends considerable time on cases, including Second Amendment cases involving gun control -- an issue Republicans have repeatedly emphasized during her confirmation hearings. The National Rifle Association, unswayed by Sotomayor's assertion earlier in the week that she recognizes an individual right to bear arms, announced Thursday that it is opposed to her nomination. \"We believe any individual who does not agree that the Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right and who does not respect our God-given right of self-defense should not serve on any court, much less the highest court in the land,\" said a joint statement by Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive vice president, and Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Reform. Sotomayor repeatedly said she recognizes an individual right to firearms in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in the 2007 case District of Columbia v. Heller. The high court in that instance ruled that a sweeping handgun ban in the nation's capital violated the constitutional right to \"keep and bear arms.\" Sotomayor refused to say, however, whether she believed the right is \"fundamental,\" which in legal terms refers to whether a federal statute applies to the states. On gun control, as in other issues, Sotomayor repeated that the Constitution and facts of the case would be the basis of her rulings. The highly charged issue of affirmative action surfaced most prominently later in the day, when Frank Ricci testified before the committee. Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after the city threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals -- including Sotomayor -- backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination, and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\" Ricci also criticized the 2nd Circuit for disposing \"of our case in an unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\" Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She told committee members earlier in the week, however, that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of \"a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court\" and followed a firmly established precedent.  Watch Ricci testify at hearings » . The Supreme Court applied a new standard, she claimed, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court. Ricci was one of a long list of witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor. Linda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that \"it is clear\" from Sotomayor's record \"that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics.\" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge, Chavez claimed, when she has \"shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her.\" Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci was case, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents, he claimed, dating back almost three decades. FBI Director Louis Freeh and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor. Bloomberg told committee members that she is an \"independent jurist\" with \"sharp and agile mind\" who would bring \"a wealth of unique experience\" to the high court. Committee Republicans, unswayed by such assertions, once again examined Sotomayor's controversial statement that a \"wise Latina\" could reach a better decision than a white man. Asked what she would say to people offended by her remarks, Sotomayor said that she regrets that she has \"offended some people. I believe that my life demonstrates that that was not my intent to leave the impression that some have taken from my words.\" Sotomayor was also asked to explain her remarks from a 2001 speech in which she said she agreed that \"there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives -- no neutrality, no escape from choice in judging.\" She told the committee that, in every case, the two opposing parties view the facts from vastly different perspectives. \"You can't just throw up your hands and say I'm not going to rule,\" she said. There is a choice in judging, which means \"you have to rule.\" CNN's Dana Bash and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\n(AOL Autos) -- With car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right, it's important to remember that today's automotive titans started out as tiny startups, not unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. General Motors was almost called International Motors Co. Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today. But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it \"Boo-ick,\" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the \"Hupp\" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s. Swiss-born Louis Chevrolet's experience was similar. Durant brought him into a new car-building venture in 1911, hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver. Chevrolet left the company in 1913, apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles. But its name stuck to the new Chevrolet vehicles; Durant reportedly liked its musical lilt. It could also work the other way around. In 1925, Walter P. Chrysler got the naming rights to the Maxwell Motor Co. after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two-year period. Things turned out a little differently for Henry Ford. He suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name. But his revenge was sweet. The Henry Ford Company, which traded freely on Ford's early fame as an inventor, fired him in 1902 \"because he was spending all his time developing a race car, not a passenger car,\" according to the Encyclopedia of American Business and Biography. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers most important new car . After Ford was gone, the company was renamed Cadillac, after Antoine Laumet de la Mothe Cadillac, the French nobleman who founded Detroit in 1703; his heraldry became the model's badge and the company became a part of General Motors in 1909. After his firing, Ford quickly found investors to help him found his own firm, the Ford Motor Co., in 1903. He introduced the company's first new vehicle, the Model and followed it up with other low-cost vehicles, including his greatest achievement, the Model T, in 1908. Its price tag started at $850 and fell steadily as Ford introduced more production innovations. The young firm became phenomenally successful. AOL Autos: 10 classic American rides . In the 1920s, he got the chance to buy the five-year-old Lincoln Motor Co. out of bankruptcy. It was then owned by one of the very people, Henry Leland, who fired him in 1902. Then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the Lincoln name. For its part, General Motors almost didn't get the name it bears today. Durant actually incorporated his company under the name \"International Motors Co.\", in New Jersey in 1908. But his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name. \"We might use 'United Motors Company' were it not for the fact that there is already a United Motor Car Company in that state,\" the attorney wrote. \"We suggest the name General Motors Company, as we have ascertained it can be used.\" A newly coined French word, auto-mobile, inspired many vehicle names of the early years. Inventor Ransom E. Olds filed a patent for an \"auto-mobile\" during the mid-1890s. Names like Bugmobile, Locomobile, Hupmobile, and of course, the Oldsmobile, could not have come along without it. The origins of some names can be tricky to trace. The first use of Jeep, for instance. is shrouded in mist. Jim Allen, the author of a book called \"Jeep,\" concludes that it's based on early World War II slang for \"a new, unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle.\" It wasn't until 1950 that Toledo-based Willys-Overland, Inc., one of the producers of the early four-wheel-drive vehicle, trademarked the term. Many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry. The Toyota name came from the Toyoda loom works in Kariya, Japan; When it turned to car production, the Toyoda family changed the 'd' to a 't' to make it simpler and more elegant in Japanese script. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car names . There's little doubt about other brand names. Pontiac was an offshoot of the Pontiac Buggy Co., a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned Indian chief. Mechanic Soichiro Honda started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of World War II and eventually graduated to cars. AOL Autos: Pontiacs we'll never forget . Volkswagen, a response to Adolf Hitler's call for a car for the common folk, means 'people's car' in German, evidently beating out the prototype's name, 'Strength through Joy,' for the honors. In 1917, the Rapp Engine Works became known as the Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, or Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) as the four-year-old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines, with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo, according to some authorities. The first BMW cars were produced 11 years later. The legendary Jaguar name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time. It beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a British ad agency in 1935. In 1939, Ford struck gold with Mercury, the fleet-footed messenger of the gods. It tapped into Greek and Roman mythology for the name, just as it did for the similarly styled Lincoln Zephyr, the god of the wind, three years earlier. Some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms. Fiat stands for Fabbrica Italiani Automobili Torino, or Italian Automotive Works Turin. Similarly, Saab stands for Svenska Aeroplanaktiebolaget, or Swedish Aeroplane Ltd., hearkening back to the automaker's origins as an aircraft company. Ford might have done better with an acronym in 1958. The Edsel was conceived as a new, distinct Ford Motor Co. brand, with its own models, badge and division. The mission was to take on GM's Oldsmobile. After considering thousands of suggestions, Ford named the new brand after Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's only child. He had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943. The name Edsel was an immediate letdown. Ford stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced. One disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales. AOL Autos: Best and worst automotive designs of all time . Its name wasn't the sole reason for its failure. It didn't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on Ford and Mercury models. But all that didn't stop Edsel from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure."}

Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March 2009 in New York and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. Al Qaeda recruits say they received training in how to handle rockets, explosives and bombs. (CNN) -- The interrogations of two accused Westerners who say they trained and fought with al Qaeda in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region provide an inside view of the terror group's organizational structures. Arguably, they shed more light on the state of al Qaeda than any material previously released into the public domain. The documents reveal training programs and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective U.S. missile strikes. Bryant Vinas -- a U.S. citizen who says he traveled to Pakistan in September 2007 to fight against Americans in Afghanistan -- stated that between March and July 2008 he attended three al Qaeda training courses, which focused on weapons, explosives, and rocket-based or -propelled weaponry. During these classes, attended by 10-20 recruits, Vinas was taught how to handle a large variety of weapons and explosives, some of them of military grade sophistication, according to his account. Read how al Qaeda is now operating . Vinas stated he became familiar with seeing, smelling and touching different explosives such as TNT, as well as plastic explosives such as RDX, Semtex, C3 and C4 -- the explosive U.S. authorities have stated was used in al Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in 2000. Vinas also learned how to make vests for suicide bombers. Vinas stated he was also instructed how to prepare and place fuses, how to test batteries, how to use voltmeters and how to build circuitry for a bomb. Read how Vinas met with al Qaeda leaders . According to his account, al Qaeda also offered a wide variety of other courses including electronics, sniper, and poisons training. Instruction in the actual construction of bombs, he stated, was offered to al Qaeda recruits who had become more advanced in their training. Vinas' training during this period was very similar to the training described by members of a French-Belgian group who also spent time in the tribal areas of Pakistan in 2008. Walid Othmani, a French recruit, stated the group were given explosives training and taught how to fire rocket launchers and RPGs. Othmani provided French interrogators with an account of his time in Pakistan after being arrested on his return to Europe. Three other members of his group are now in Belgian custody awaiting trial for \"participation in a terrorist group.\" Belgian prosecutors told CNN Othmani has been charged in France with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act. A Belgian legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by CNN. Like Vinas, Othmani said the group had been required to sign forms before their training. Othmani stated his group was required to pledge absolute obedience to their handlers and indicate whether they wanted to become suicide bombers. Othmani provided interesting new details about the training facilities being used by al Qaeda in the tribal areas. His group trained in a small mountain shack, a far cry from the large camps al Qaeda had run in Taliban-era Afghanistan, when it had been able to operate with little danger of being targeted by military strikes. Othmani's account made clear that al Qaeda has had to decentralize its operations in Pakistan in response to the growing effectiveness of U.S. Predator strikes. However the wide number of training courses described by both Vinas and Othmani suggest that al Qaeda has been able to adapt well to the new security environment. By operating a larger number of smaller facilities, al Qaeda would also appear to have increased its resilience to attack. Read how al Qaeda is looking for Western targets . While the classrooms are safer from drone attacks than the pre-9/11 sessions on the mountainsides the content seems to have changed to match new targeting plans. Suicide vest and IED construction show how the curriculum is being modified for today's combat with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Making and handling explosives, as well as fuse construction, show the sessions may also be geared for killing in Europe and the United States. These are the very skills the July 7, 2005 London bombers Shehzad Tanweer and Mohammed Siddique Khan came to Pakistan to learn. Al Qaeda, it would seem, may still want to pull off the spectacular attack in Europe or the United States. Vinas says he took a course in propelled weaponry with Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, a former taxi driver in Brussels, Belgium, whom he first met in March 2008 and formed a friendship with. Vinas stated that when they completed their training, Al Qaeda instructors did a written evaluation of their performance. Vinas had been judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against U.S. and NATO bases in Afghanistan, according to his account. That suggests al Qaeda has maintained its capacity for administration and paperwork even in a harsher security environment. When their training finished in the summer of 2008, Vinas and Zrioul lived in the same house in the mountains of Waziristan. Zrioul managed to acquire a computer which he rigged up to watch jihadist videos. During a mountain walk with Zrioul one day, Vinas says he was told about a new course being taught by al Qaeda called \"international operations\" set up by al Qaeda's head of international operations whom Vinas later identified as Abu Hafith. Hafith, he stated, was responsible for recruitment and direction of terrorist cells, and attacks outside Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hafith was identified by his initials in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. He is believed to be still at large in the Pakistan-Afghan border area. Vinas was told that the training course that Hafith set up focused on kidnapping and assassination, including instruction on the use of silencers and how to break into and enter a property. The revelations raise the possibility that al Qaeda was developing a program of targeted assassinations. Though al Qaeda has carried out some assassinations in the past, most of its attacks in the West have not targeted any particular individuals but crowded areas, such as mass transport. According to Othmani, al Qaeda fighters totaled between 300-500 in Pakistan's Tribal Areas -- spread out in groups of 10. Such decentralization was a function of the growing deadliness of U.S. Predator strikes. Hicham Beyayo, a Belgian jihadist volunteer, said the group moved around a lot because such strikes were known to be \"very effective,\" his lawyer Christophe Marchand, told CNN. The loss of an increasing number of operatives, stated Othmani, prompted an order from al Qaeda's top command for fighters to remain inside as much as possible. In order to keep in touch, jihadists operated a courier service across the region, according to the Frenchman's testimony. The decentralization of al Qaeda's structures appears to have created some costs for recruits. Two members of the Belgian-French group now in custody describe feeling increasingly cut off, bored, and fed up with the primitive living conditions in their mountain shacks, according to documents obtained by CNN and the defense lawyer of one of those charged. They often did not seem to know what their next orders would be or where their handlers would take them. They also described being deeply frustrated at being repeatedly given false promises that they would be able to fight in Afghanistan. Othmani also described the group's frustration at having to pay for their own weapons and training -- at a cost of 1,300 euros each (about $1,800) -- which if true might lend credence to reports that al Qaeda has come under financial strain. Vinas, for his part, made no mention of having to make payments to his handlers. Vinas and Othmani's accounts also suggest that al Qaeda may be having leadership problems. While able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested, the group seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures. A former U.S. government official, specializing in counter-terrorism, commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago. The only difference, there are fewer of them.\n\n**News 2**:\nKABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Security remains a top concern, as Afghanistan holds its second-ever presidential election Thursday, prompting the government to ask for a ban on media coverage of violence. An Afghan police officer walks near a bank in Kabul where an armed robbery ended in a gunbattle. Afghanistan's government has ordered the media to refrain from covering possible attacks on election day in an effort to \"ensure the wide participation of the Afghan people.\" \"If anybody broadcasts or gives news about any movements or activities of terrorists, domestic media offices will be closed, and foreigners will be kicked out of the country,\" according to a statement from Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmad Zahir Faqiri. He said the order is in line with Afghanistan's constitution, which allows for such mandates \"in exceptional situations\" to protect \"national interest and national security.\" Escalating violence in the capital, Kabul, this week has made some Afghans think twice about whether to venture out to vote. \"If we are not at peace, why should we vote, who should we vote for?\" asked Ferishta, 21, who last weekend lay in a blood-soaked shirt and was connected to an intravenous drip after a suicide bombing. But at least one independent news agency refused to heed a blackout on reports of violence. Restricting media freedoms has no basis in the Afghan constitution, said the Kabul-based Pajhwok News Agency. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul insisted that press freedoms are necessary to ensure credible elections. \"While we recognize the sovereign rights of the Afghan government and note their intention to encourage Afghans to turn out and vote, we believe that free media reporting is directly linked to the credibility of the elections and continue to support the freedom of the press and responsible reporting,\" spokeswoman Fleur Cowan said in an e-mail. On the eve of the election, roadside bombs killed three Afghan election workers in the southern province of Kandahar, and four others were killed Tuesday in the northern province of Badakshan, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan spokesman Noor Mohammad Noor said. Amid the violence, the candidates wrapped up last-minute campaigning with the hope that the elections can showcase their country's fledgling democracy. \"We're at a moment of truth,\" said Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the International Crisis Group, an independent advisory and analysis organization. An incumbent president and about 40 challengers, including two women, are on the ballot, vying for the votes of what the election commission says are an estimated 17 million registered Afghans against a backdrop of war, graft, poverty and illiteracy. More than 3,000 donkeys, 3,000 cars and three helicopters will traverse harsh terrain to carry voting materials to remote polling stations, the election commission says. And 30 observer groups, domestic and international, will be on hand to help guard against fraud, it says. At the heart of every vote will be the two biggest impediments to progress in one of the poorest nations in the world: stifling corruption and an increasingly bloody Taliban insurgency. International donors are helping pay for the $223 million electoral undertaking, and hundreds of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers have moved into strife-torn southern Afghanistan to protect voters against possible Taliban attacks. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, expressed optimism that Thursday's vote would be Afghanistan's moment to shine. It's tough to organize elections during a war, he said, but the reality is that violence during elections is commonplace in many parts of the world. \"Afghanistan has never had a contested election,\" Holbrooke said. \"So this is a remarkable experiment in democracy and something that Afghanistan needs to give legitimacy to the new government.\" That legitimacy has become a key issue in the campaign. Frontrunner President Hamid Karzai's chief challengers -- former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani and former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah -- have both lashed out at the incumbent for failing to rein in corruption. In its annual global corruption perception index in 2008, Transparency International ranked Afghanistan 176 out of 180 countries and said graft is \"a major factor impeding the country's stability and future growth.\" Ghani said the most significant challenge Afghanistan's next president will face is earning back the trust of the people. \"This government has lost it,\" he said in a recent interview. \"There is no sense of trust, not only in the current leadership but in the political class as such. And in the capacity of the state or the international community to improve the lot of our people.\" Ghani characterized Karzai as a \"very poor manager\" who failed to deal with pressing issues and create any sense of momentum for the nation moving forward. As a guest on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" this month, Ghani said Afghanistan's corruption had metastasized into a cancer that was \"eating through the society.\" Abdullah argued that people's dissatisfaction with the Karzai government has helped strengthen the insurgency. \"There is no doubt there is a hard-core element in it,\" he said. \"But there are thousands of people under the same brand, Taliban, [who] have joined the insurgency because of other reasons.\" The insurgents are filling a vacuum left by Afghanistan's Western-backed government, which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede suffers from nepotism, corruption and predatory practices. During a recent political debate, Karzai admitted that corruption was a problem but offered no specific cures. He also has been blamed for what has become the bloodiest summer since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Most polls, however, show Karzai with a commanding lead. Latifa, a Kabul housewife, said she was pleased with Karzai's stewardship and would vote for him. \"Like raising a child for seven years, in seven years he has helped our Kabul, our Afghanistan, stand on its own two feet,\" she said. \"We didn't know an election before; we hadn't seen a parliament.\" But can a nation as troubled as Afghanistan carry out fair and free elections? Some observers of Afghanistan and human rights activists have voiced their doubts. Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative in Afghanistan, said Thursday's election will be the most difficult he has encountered in his life. Besides the violence and corruption, a weak infrastructure and a high illiteracy rate will add to election woes, he said. The problems were reflected in a new Gallup Poll that found fewer than one in four voting-age Afghans are confident the election will be fair and transparent. Voting in Afghanistan, Eide said, is not yet the kind of democratic expression understood in the West. \"If you look at the well-established democracies in the West, for instance, that's not possible under these circumstances,\" he said. \"But what my objective is that we have credible, inclusive elections where the result will be accepted by the people. That is our level of ambition, and I think we will achieve that.\" Eide said that a significant number of polling stations in Helmand, Kandahar, Ghazni and Wardak provinces will not be able to open for security reasons. He said ballots ought to be counted at the polling center itself instead of transporting them elsewhere and increasing the possibility of fraud, encountered in the last election in 2004. Of the 4.6 million new registered voters, 39 percent are women. So thousands of women had to be employed to search burqa-clad female voters at polling places. Human Rights Watch, however, said this week that the recruitment drive for women began too late and as a result, not enough women will be available for security checks. \"Women voters have been badly let down by their government and its international backers,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. Women's votes will be closely watched in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime stripped women of equal rights and education, essentially hurtling them back to the Stone Age. But despite the violence, despite the threats from the Taliban to disrupt the voting, enthusiasm filled the air this week. A campaign rally resembled more a rock concert than a political event in Afghanistan, as Kabul stadium transformed into a sea of blue, Abdullah's campaign color. Supporters hoisted banners and sported T-shirts emblazoned with Abdullah's face. Not old enough to vote, another young woman named Ferishta -- this one 15 years old and a beauty school student -- attended a rally for Ghani with many of her classmates. \"We want a president who is peaceful and caring,\" she said. \"We don't want any more bombs. In these bombs, so many Afghans have died, one person's son, one person's child.\" But no one can predict whether abounding energy will translate into high turnout. Not in a war-ravaged nation. Not when bombs were still exploding just hours before balloting was to begin. CNN's Atia Abawi, Ivan Watson, Kevin Flower and Moni Basu contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "4k", "total_prompt_tokens": 3755, "how_many_news": 2, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez froze diplomatic relations with Colombia late Tuesday, citing verbal aggressions from the neighboring South American country. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro speaks to journalists on Monday in Caracas. The televised announcement followed declarations from the Colombian government Monday that anti-tank weapons purchased by Venezuela ended up in the hands of the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. In addition, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said the guerrillas were trying to buy anti-aircraft missiles. Venezuela received a shipment of Russian SA-24 Igla shoulder-fired missiles earlier this year and showed them off at military parade in April. Chavez recalled Venezuela's ambassador to Colombia, as well as most of the embassy's staff. \"Leave only the lowest functionaries,\" he said. Chavez also threatened to take over Colombian companies operating in Venezuela if Colombia offends Venezuela one more time. Colombia's claims are \"mistaken,\" added Chavez, who called the country's leaders \"irresponsible.\" There was no immediate reaction from the Colombian government. Tuesday's developments came one day after Chavez signed a military agreement with Russia to buy enough BMP-3 armored fighting vehicles and T-72 tanks to double the nation's inventory, according to the Jane's Defense Weekly publication. Chavez said he will use the tanks in his \"Western Shield Plan\" on the border with Colombia. Tensions between the two countries have been high since March 2008, when Chavez ordered tanks to the border in response to a Colombian attack on FARC bases in Ecuador. More recently, Chavez has severely criticized Uribe for entering into negotiations to allow the United States to open military bases in Colombia. The United States says it needs the bases because Ecuador has ordered the closing of a U.S. installation there. Chavez accuses the United States of wanting the bases so it can attack Venezuela. Analysts say Chavez's actions toward Colombia are tied to his feelings toward the United States. \"Chavez hates the United States and he wants to lead a group of countries that don't pay attention to the United States,\" said Myles Frechette, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia from 1994-97. \"Uribe is a guy who is in tune with the United States.\" Frechette notes that \"Colombia and Venezuela have complementary economies\" and could sell more goods to each other under better conditions. Jennifer McCoy, director of the Americas Program at the Carter Center, makes the same point. \"It's a conflict between two ideologies between two countries that are mutually dependent on each other,\" she said. The latest dust-up started Monday, when Colombia accused Venezuela of selling arms to the FARC. Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos said army troops had found AT-4 shoulder-fired grenades in recent raids on jungle camps used by the FARC. \"This is not the first time that this happens,\" Santos said. \"In several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the FARC, we have found powerful munitions and powerful equipment, including anti-tank weapons, from a European country that sold them to Venezuela and that turned up in the hands of the FARC.\" The guerrillas were trying to buy anti-aircraft missiles, Uribe said. Analysts say that could change the guerrilla war's dynamics. \"The AT-4 is much less of a heavy weapon, but surface-to-air missiles would give the FARC a much greater military capability,\" said Anna Gilmour, senior America's analyst for the Jane's Country Risk consultancy group. Uribe said Monday that must not be allowed to happen. \"The international community must help us,\" he said. \"These bandits have historically been able to rely on many sources for armaments. We have found out through intelligence that they are now looking to buy surface-to-air weapons to use against our airplanes.\" Venezuelan officials denied any involvement. \"To me it seems that this is a new attack against our government based on lies,\" Venezuelan Minister of the Interior and Justice Tareck El Aissami said at a news conference Monday. \"We absolutely deny that our government or our institutions are providing assistance to criminal and terrorist organizations. \"It's laughable, it sounds like a cheap film made by the American government.\" Sweden probes 'serious incident' Officials in Sweden, where the anti-tank weapons were made by Saab Bofors Dynamics, verified that the AT-4s were sold to Venezuela in the 1980s. Anders Jorle, Sweden's foreign ministry spokesman, told CNN the government \"considers this as a serious incident\" and is investigating. \"We've been in contact with Colombian and Venezuelan authorities to clarify how this happened,\" Jorle said Tuesday. \"The weapons were part of a lot sold to Venezuela 20 years ago. No weapons have been exported to Venezuela since 2006.\" The Swedish Foreign Ministry added that the Swedish Inspectorate of Strategic Products, the authority responsible for checking weapon exports, will consider not selling any more weapons to Venezuela. The FARC most likely acquired the AT-4 grenade launchers in the past 18 months, said Jane's analyst Gilmour. This is not the first time that Venezuela has been tied to the FARC, which has been fighting the Colombian government for more than 45 years. Last fall, the U.S. Treasury Department accused two senior Venezuelan intelligence officials and a former official of providing weapons to the FARC and assisting the rebels with narcotics trafficking. The U.S. identified one of the individuals as Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, director of Venezuela's Military Intelligence Directorate. Another individual was identified as Ramon Emilio Rodriguez Chacin, who was Venezuela's Minister of Interior and Justice until September. Rodriguez Chacin was \"the Venezuelan government's main weapons contact for the FARC,\" the Treasury Department said. \"The FARC uses its proceeds from narcotics sales to purchase weapons from the Venezuelan government. Rodriguez Chacin has held numerous meetings with senior FARC members, one of which occurred at the Venezuelan government's Miraflores Palace in late 2007. Rodriguez Chacin has also assisted the FARC by trying to facilitate a $250 million dollar loan from the Venezuelan government to the FARC in late 2007.\" Computers recovered last year in the Colombian attack on the FARC base in Ecuador showed that \"Chavez has been heavily involved with the FARC,\" said Susan Kaufman Purcell, director of the Center for Hemispheric Policy at the University of Miami. \"Chavez has been modeling himself more on what [former Cuban leader Fidel] Castro used to do in terms of helping insurgencies and destabilizing countries,\" Purcell said. Analysts point to Venezuela's increasing militarization as a threat to stability. From 2005-07, Venezuela bought $4.4 billion in weapons and military hardware, including 24 Sukhoi-24 aircraft, 50 combat helicopters and 100,000 AK-103 assault rifles, Gilmour said. Last year, Russia extended a $1 billion credit line for further acquisitions. \"Venezuela has been trying to frighten everyone in the region by buying Russian weapons,\" said former U.S. envoy Frechette. He said Chavez has become increasingly frustrated that he doesn't always get his way, such as in his relations with Colombia. So he turns to the Russians. Analysts: Chavez role in military sales in question . Chavez's involvement in the sale of the anti-tank weapons to the FARC is open to discussion, though. \"The more interesting question is how they got there and whether Chavez had anything to do with it,\" Purcell said. Frechette agrees, saying, \"Nobody can say this was done by Chavez.\" The former envoy believes there's a good chance that the sale was carried out by corrupt officers without Chavez's involvement. \"Don't underestimate the corruption in that country,\" he said, adding that some military officials might have \"discovered these things that have been sitting in a warehouse since the 1980s.\" Whether Venezuela would sell surface-to-air missiles also is open to discussion. Gilmour says Venezuela will want to safeguard its stockpile. \"Venezuela would not want any kind of seepage because the missiles were acquired so recently and Venezuela-Russia relations are pretty positive at the moment,\" she said. Purcell said Russia might not care, pointing out that \"Castro did all sorts of things that the Soviets didn't like\" but still kept supporting him for decades. \"Russia has a lot of different interests,\" she said. \"It's not clear that they would walk away from the relationship.\" CNN's Laura Perez Maestro and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\nEditor's note: The following story, based on testimony in Phillip Garrido's trial for a 1976 kidnapping, contains some sexually explicit material. Phillip Garrido is show in an early mug shot taken in connection with the 1976 rape and abduction case. (CNN) -- Fifteen years before the girl was held captive in the shed, there was the woman in the warehouse -- and at least one other woman who escaped capture. Phillip Garrido, who with his wife is charged in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, had been convicted of kidnapping before. When he stalked, kidnapped and raped Katie Callaway Hall on November 22, 1976, he fulfilled an overpowering sexual fantasy that he had methodically planned for weeks, according to court records obtained by CNN. He told police it was his second kidnapping attempt of the day. Those facts came to light in Garrido's 1977 trial, in which he was convicted and sentenced to 50 years for kidnapping and rape. In her testimony, Hall said Garrido asked for a ride in her car, then bound and handcuffed her before taking her to a small warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he repeatedly raped her for 5½ hours. It was not an act of impulse. \"He told me he had been renting it [the small warehouse] for a couple weeks, preparing it,\" Hall testified.  Watch how Garrido prepared for and explained the kidnapping » . It is CNN policy to withhold the identity of alleged victims of sexual assault. But in this case, Hall recounted her ordeal last week in an interview on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" saying it changed her life forever. \"I had to tell everyone I met what had happened to me -- because I didn't feel like myself. It was as if I had to explain why I wasn't 'normal,' \" she said.  Watch Hall describe her ordeal » . She was not his first victim that day. The trial transcript reveals that Garrido told authorities that one hour before Hall's kidnapping, he tried to kidnap another woman, who wrestled away and escaped. And, police in Antioch disclosed last week that Garrido was charged with raping a 14-year-old in 1972, but the charges were dropped because the victim refused to testify.   Watch details of the 1972 case » . In the case involving Hall, CNN reviewed the 1977 trial documents, which include Garrido's psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of Hall and Garrido. The documents reveal a pattern of behavior that Garrido is accused of repeating in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, who was recently found after being kept in a shed for 18 years. The 32-year-old documents also detail Garrido's self-described struggle with drugs and his efforts to control his sexual obsessions.  Can sex offenders be cured? » . Garrido and his wife, Nancy, have pleaded not guilty to charges involving Dugard's abduction, but police say he admitted kidnapping her in his initial interview. Police say Garrido and his wife kidnapped Dugard outside her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, and took her to an elaborate compound hidden in the backyard of their Antioch, California, home more than 160 miles away. Tucked behind overgrown trees and a fence were tents, outbuildings and a soundproof shed where Dugard lived with the two daughters she had with her captor. Out of sight . Garrido took great pains to make sure nobody could find the camp, not even the parole officer who visited twice a month at times, police said. Hall, too, was taken directly to a carefully prepped small warehouse after her kidnapping. As they drove from South Lake Tahoe, California, where she was abducted, to Reno, she tried to persuade Garrido to rape her in the bushes. \"I asked him, couldn't we just pull over and get it over with,\" she testified. But Garrido was determined. \"You might as well get that our of your mind; you are going with me, you have got no choice,\" Hall testified Garrido told her, according to court transcripts. \"I have it all planned.\" He had set up the mini-warehouse in Reno exactly as he wanted, and worked to ensure nobody would inquire about it. He asked a man who lived in a storage unit 30 feet away to call him should any unknown vehicles show up. The mini-warehouse was meticulously furnished. On the other side of an unassuming metal, garage-style door, the walls were covered in long, heavy rugs hanging from the ceiling. Thick opaque plastic sheets were scattered throughout, creating a maze-like atmosphere that prohibited anyone from seeing all the way through, Hall testified. Staging the attacks . In the back, Garrido created a space set up like a stage. At the center was a mattress covered with an old, red satin, hole-ridden sheet and a fur blanket, Hall testified. Illuminating the bed were red, yellow and blue stage lights, with a stack of pornographic magazines and a projector alongside it. His intent, a prosecution psychologist said, couldn't have been clearer based on the methodical planning. From the moment she got to the mini-warehouse, Hall said it was clear to her Garrido was a man on a mission. \"He knew what he was doing,\" she testified. \"[He] knew exactly how he was going to do it.\" She testified that it was there that he raped her for 5½ hours. As he drank wine and she smoked a small bit of hashish, Hall said she kept track of the time by listening to a radio, which regularly announced the time. Hall didn't know that she wasn't originally part of the plan, although Garrido alluded to the fact he hadn't targeted her, saying it wasn't intentional that she was taken. \"Could have been anybody,\" Hall recalled him saying, adding he told her it was her fault because she was attractive. He didn't say that his original plan had gone awry one hour earlier. Victim managed to escape . Despite his planning, there was one thing Garrido hadn't accounted for -- that one of his intended victims would fight back. One hour before Hall was kidnapped in her own vehicle, Garrido asked a different woman in South Lake Tahoe, California, for a ride. Like Hall, she obliged. But when he tried to handcuff her, he only secured one hand. \"She jumped out of the vehicle, struggling with him,\" prosecutors told the judge during a private conversation during the trial. When he unlocked the one handcuff, she escaped by jumping out of the moving car and running up the street. That kidnapping attempt came to light in a conversation between the prosecutor, defense attorney and judge in the case, according to the trial transcript. Despite prosecutors' wishes, the details of the first kidnapping attempt were kept from the jury, after a judge ruled they weren't necessary to prove Garrido's intent to kidnap. The court documents also discussed Garrido's use of marijuana, cocaine and LSD, which Garrido said was so heavy it fueled his sexual desires and sometimes pushed him to a point he could no longer control them. He said he responded to the urges by masturbating in drive-in movie theaters, restaurants, bathrooms, bars and while watching partially clothed or naked women in their homes. An interest in young girls . Though police have recently said they never expected Garrido would have kidnapped someone as young as Dugard based on his record, Garrido's own words during his trial showed young girls did grab his attention.  Watch how Garrido slipped through the cracks » . He admitted masturbating in his car while watching small girls outside their school. Sometimes, he said, he would open the car door, get out and pull down his pants. His own explanation of his sexual fantasies hinted at an obsession with sexual bondage and captivity. \"There has been a type of bondage pictures,\" he said, when asked if certain images heightened his arousal. \"Women in handcuffs, chained.\" On the night he took Hall captive and bound her with a leather strap in her car, he said he took four hits of LSD, a drug that he said he used daily for at least four years, sometimes taking up to 10 hits at a time. He said when he used the drug it acted as a sexual stimulant. \"I had this fantasy that was driving me to do this inside of me,\" Garrido testified. \"Something that was making me want to do it without -- no way to stop.\" Garrido said the urges would strike and continue to build until he was \"overcome\" with sexual cravings. Hall was curious, too, even during her kidnapping, what would make Garrido do this to her. So she asked him. \"He said that he didn't get off on pain,\" Hall recalled during her testimony. \"It was just a fantasy he had to live out.\""}

Experience the New Orleans Jazz Fest » . Our guide prepares music fans worldwide for the best festivals this summer and later in the year. GLASTONBURY, Somerset, England June 24-28 ($255) Glastonbury has been around since dairy farmer Michael Eavis first held a free two-day festival on his farm in 1970, and it's long been the festival in England for seeing the biggest and best bands in the world. It also may be the muddiest -- heavy rain in several years, most notably 1997, turned Glastonbury into a muddy bog. Everyone from Radiohead to Jay-Z has headlined the festival, and with more than 700 acts each year, there is something for everybody. Some of the proceeds from the festival go to Oxfam and Greenpeace. This year's headliners include Franz Ferdinand, Blur, and Bruce Springsteen. ROCK AL PARQUE, Bogota, Colombia June 27-29 (free) The Rock al Parque festival, launched in 1995, has become South America's biggest rockfest in recent years -- some 320,000 people traveled to Simon Bolivar Park in 2006 for a weekend of Colombia's top rock bands and renowned international headliners. Funded by Colombia's culture secretary, the free festival has included some of rock's biggest names, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Manu Chao, and Bloc Party. In the days leading up to Rock al Parque, the festival organizers host a series of panel discussions on music production, management, and the recording industry. ROSKILDE, Denmark July 2-5 ($220) Since 1971, the rock festival in Roskilde has hosted the top names in music, from Bob Marley to Bob Dylan. It is the biggest summer festival in northern Europe, and the \"Arena\" stage boasts a 17,000-capacity tent, the largest in Europe. The festival has a daily newspaper and a 24-hour live radio station and is also home to the annual \"Naked Run,\" where the first naked person to cross the finish line receives a free ticket for next year's festival. Some 80,000 will travel to Roskilde to see headliners including Coldplay, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails. EXIT, Novi Sad, Serbia July 9-12 ($105) Created in 2000 by three university students as a protest against former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, the electro-focused festival in the heart of Serbia was named Europe's best festival in 2007 by fans voting in the UK Festival Awards. Over 200,000 people attended Exit last year, dancing at all-night raves in the gorgeous surroundings of Petrovaradin Fortress, an 18th-century castle near the Danube River. Some of techno's biggest names will be on hand to celebrate Exit's 10-year anniversary, including Moby, Kraftwerk, and The Prodigy. THISDAY, Abuja/Lagos, Nigeria Dates tba . The THISDAY festival in Nigeria -- launched in 2006 by the editor-in-chief of Thisday newspaper, Nduka Obaigbena, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the end of slavery -- is the biggest music and fashion festival in Africa.

FUJI ROCK, Naeba, Japan July 24-26 ($410) Japan's biggest outdoor festival takes its name from Mt. Fuji, the site of the first festival in 1997. Fuji Rock has been set amongst the cool forested mountains of the Naeba ski resort for the past ten years -- gondolas and hilly trails transport people from stage to stage, and the streams and forests between them are the reason why Fuji Rock has been called the most beautiful festival in the world. It's not just about the scenery, though -- over 100,000 people will trek through the mountains to see headliners Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, and Weezer. LOLLAPALOOZA, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. August 7-9 ($190) Rocker Perry Farrell began Lollapalooza in 1991 as a farewell tour for his band, Jane's Addiction. The biggest grunge rock festival during the '90s disappeared for awhile around the turn of the century, but it was revived in 2005 as a more traditional \"big weekend\" destination festival in Chicago. The past few years at Grant Park have been marked by hot summers, huge crowds, and even bigger bands. The anticipated crowd of nearly 200,000 is staggering, as are this year's headliners: Kings of Leon, Tool, Depeche Mode, and Beastie Boys, just to name a few.

The day-long festivals are followed by an official \"After Life\" party that runs until the early hours of the morning, so be prepared for a long one if you're one of the estimated 100,000 people attending a Parklife gig in one of several cities across Australia at the end of September. WOODSTOCK, Johannesburg, South Africa November 27-30  When people think of Woodstock, South Africa isn't necessarily what comes to mind. But for the past decade, the festival has been the biggest youth music event in that country, hosting a variety of both well-known and upcoming mainstream and hip-hop acts -- not to mention a variety of extreme sports stunt acts, paintballing, and flea-market stalls. Woodstock may not have the star power of the legendary American festival -- but with the wide range of music and outdoor activities it presents, its promoters aren't lying when they say that boredom simply isn't an option. SUNBURN, Goa, India  December . Sunburn Festival launched in December 2007 as South Asia's first electronic music festival, and featured heavyweights like Carl Cox and John 00 Fleming. Located seaside in Goa, on India's west coast, the festival has its roots in \"Goa Trance,\" a type of pulsing, transcendental electro music that became popular in the early 1990s. Sunburn again treated more than 5,000 electro revelers to a three-day party by the beach in December 2008. The festival's founder has said Sunburn will always be free to attend, and it is not to be missed if you happen to be in India in December.\n\n**News 2**:\n(Budget Travel) -- On your next trip, you could be checking into a wine cask, a salvaged 727 airplane, or a room where the furniture defies the law of gravity.

At Berlin's Propeller Island City Lodge, each of the 30 rooms is weird in its own way. The artist-owner, Lars Stroschen, has seen to that.

Another has furniture attached to the ceiling, another has coffins for beds, and still another has lion cages on stilts (the Web site claims that kids \"love to sleep\" in them). Then there's the Freedom Room, which resembles a prison, complete with a toilet next to the bed -- oh, that German humor! 011-49/30-891-90-16, propeller-island.com. A place to unwine'd . When they were owned by a Swiss château, the four enormous casks on the grounds of the Hotel De Vrouwe Van Stavoren in the Netherlands held the equivalent of 19,333 bottles of wine. Now, after some creative recycling, it's guests rather than booze that mellow out inside the casks. The richly worn and airtight oak barrels have two narrow beds, with a small sitting area outside. The grounds are quite close to tiny Stavoren's harbor, which was a major port in the Middle Ages. 011-31/51-46-81-202, hotel-vrouwevanstavoren.nl. A bad trip (with none of the consequences) The daughter of Ho Chi Minh's number two masterminded the Hang Nga Guest House and Art Gallery, a complex that more than earns its local nickname, the Crazy House. This LSD nightmare's three main buildings are Gaudi-esque concrete treehouse-like growths that appear as if they flowed organically out of the ground. Inside, the walls seem to dissolve into the floor, and right angles are avoided entirely. Each guest room is built around a different animal theme: the Eagle Room has a big-beaked bird standing atop a huge egg, while another has arm-sized ants crawling up the wall. The animal theme continues outside -- a large giraffe statue on the property contains a teahouse, and human-size \"spider webs\" are set up here and there. 011-84/63-82-20-70. Budget Travel: Check out these unusual hotels . In a league of its own . Hydrophobics should stay far from Jules' Undersea Lodge, named for novelist Jules Verne of \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" fame. The 600-square-foot lodge, a former marine lab, is 21 feet underwater, close to the bottom of the mangrove-filled Emerald Lagoon, in Key Largo. You'll have to know how to scuba dive to reach your room, and guests without the mandatory certification must take a course at the hotel. Once you've reached the lodge, which sleeps up to six, you'll be close to angelfish, anemones, barracuda, oysters, and other creatures -- each room is equipped with a 42-inch window, so you don't need to be suited up to keep an eye on the neighborhood. 305/451-2353, jul.com. Crash in a jet plane . Near a beach that's within Manuel Antonio National Park, the Hotel Costa Verde doesn't lack for great sights. But few are as amazing as its own 727 Fuselage Suite, a salvaged 1965 Boeing 727-100 that looks as if it's crashed into the Costa Rican jungle (it's actually mounted atop a 50-foot pillar and reached via a spiral staircase). The jet's interior was once able to hold up to 125 passengers, but there are few reminders left of its days in the service of South African Airways and Colombia's Avianca Airlines. The suite's two bedrooms, dining area, and sitting room are now covered over entirely in teak to match the surroundings. Guests can play \"spot the toucan\" on the small wood deck that sits on top of the right wing. 011-506/27-77-05-84 or 866/854-7958, costaverde.com/727.html. Your escape pod awaits . Colored bright-orange for easy visibility, the '70s-era escape pods that make up the Capsule Hotel once hung outside oil rigs, ready to be deployed in case of an evacuation. Recycled by self-proclaimed \"garbage architect\" Denis Oudendijk, the fleet of pods now rotates among different moorings in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. At the moment, two are in the western Dutch town of Vlissingen and another is in The Hague. For a kind of James Bond-meets-Barbarella twist, opt to book your pod with a disco ball and all the spy's movies on DVD. It's a super-kitschy nod to a similar pod's appearance in \"The Spy Who Loved Me.\" 011-31/641-76-55-60, capsulehotel.info. On the road again . Imagine how much ground you could cover if you took your bed with you. That's the idea behind Exploranter Overland Hotel, a converted 25-ton truck that's a true hotel on wheels in Brazil. An awning extends out from the truck's side to provide some al fresco shade at lunchtime. The \"kitchen\" comes tricked out with fridges, freezers, and a large convection oven -- on this trip, the restaurant comes with you too, and sometimes nearby cooks are brought in to give guests a taste of the local cuisine. Your luggage and sleeping quarters are towed behind you, in a trailer that sleeps up to 24. With so much flexibility, guests can see Brazil's back country, far from crowds and sometimes any other people at all. The tours, which last from three days up to three months or more, have included horseback riding, vineyard tours, bird watching, and rodeos. 011-55/11-99-38-00-58, exploranter.com. Where the penthouse is a trailer park . Cape Town, South Africa's sleek Grand Daddy hotel has a surprise on its roof: a fleet of seven Airstream trailers, six of which were imported from the U.S. The aluminum-clad \"rooms,\" which sleep two people, have been done in playful themes that incorporate icons like \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\" (a blonde wig and a bear suit are available for dress-up), and John Lennon and Yoko Ono (the room's white-on-white furnishings include an enormous bed, natch). If you don't want to stray as far from the trailers' original looks, there's the Pleasantville model, an Eisenhower-era fantasia with chintz, harvest-gold curtains, and flower-covered throw pillows. 011-27/21-424-7247, granddaddy.co.za. STILL WEIRD! Meet the giraffes (from the 2008 edition) Without sacrificing its estate-in-the-country dignity -- or all of it, anyway -- Giraffe Manor in Langata, Kenya, is arranged so that roaming giraffes can poke their heads into any open window or doorway with impunity and lather guests with their sticky, prehensile tongues.

By 30 he was a hip-hop legend -- having gone, in his words, \"from grams to Grammys.\" Jay-Z tells Oprah Winfrey a conversation with his father freed him \"one hundred percent.\" Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed. The rapper, now 39, was born Shawn Carter in Brooklyn, New York. His albums include \"Reasonable Doubt,\" \"The Black Album\" and the just-released \"The Blueprint 3.\" Jay-Z also owns a portion of the NBA's New Jersey Nets and founded, with Damon Dash, the clothing line Rocawear. Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life. The following is an edited version of the interview. Oprah Winfrey: When you were 5, your family moved to the Marcy projects -- and then your father left when you were 11. When you look back at that, what did your 11-year-old self feel? Jay-Z: Anger. At the whole situation. Because when you're growing up, your dad is your superhero. Once you've let yourself fall that in love with someone, once you put him on such a high pedestal and he lets you down, you never want to experience that pain again. So I remember just being really quiet and really cold. Never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again. I carried that feeling throughout my life, until my father and I met up before he died. Oprah: Wow. I've never heard a man phrase it that way. You know, I've done many shows about divorce, and the real crime is when the kids aren't told. They just wake up one day and their dad is gone. Did that happen to you? Jay-Z: We were told our parents would separate, but the reasons weren't explained. My mom prepared us more than he did. I don't think he was ready for that level of discussion and emotion. He was a guy who was pretty detached from his feelings. Oprah: Did you wonder why he left? Jay-Z: I summed it up that they weren't getting along. There was a lot of arguing. Oprah: And did you know you were angry? Jay-Z: Yeah. I also felt protective of my mom. I remember telling her, \"Don't worry, when I get big, I'm going to take care of this.\" I felt like I had to step up. I was 11 years old, right? But I felt I had to make the situation better. Oprah: How did that change you? Jay-Z: It made me not express my feelings as much. I was already a shy kid, and it made me a little reclusive. But it also made me independent. And stronger. It was a weird juxtaposition. Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder. Did your father's leaving have anything to do with that? Did it turn you into the kind of angry kid who would end up shooting his brother? Jay-Z: Yes -- and my brother was dealing with a lot of demons. Oprah: How old was he? Jay-Z: About 16. He was doing a lot of drugs. He was taking stuff from our family. I was the youngest, but I felt like I needed to protect everybody. Oprah: So how did you get back in touch with your father? Jay-Z: My mom set up a meeting. And now I realize why -- it makes all the sense in the world. I remember very distinctly that I had a conversation with her in my kitchen. I was saying, \"You know, Ma, I've really been trying to look inward, and maybe I'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do.\" She just looked at me like, \"Hush up, boy.\" Oprah: Wow. Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father. I was like, \"Ma, I'm a grown man. I don't need a dad now.\" Oprah: You didn't feel a hole in your soul? Jay-Z: I never looked at that. I guess I didn't want to deal with it. Because, you know, once I looked, I'd have to do something about it. And I guess I still had too much resentment and anger. Oprah: In one of your songs, you wrote that you weren't sure if your father even remembered your birthday is in December. Jay-Z: I believed that. When I was a kid, I once waited for him on a bench. He never showed up. Even as an adult, that affected me. So when my mom set up this meeting, I told her he wouldn't come -- and the first time, he didn't. At that point, I was really done, but Mom pushed for another meeting, because she's just a beautiful soul. Oprah: The second time, your father showed up. Jay-Z: He showed up. And I gave him the real conversation. I told him how I felt the day he left. He was saying stuff like \"Man, you knew where I was.\" I'm like, \"I was a kid! Do you realize how wrong you were? It was your responsibility to see me.\" He finally accepted that. Oprah: Where had he been? Jay-Z: At his mom's house 10 minutes away from me. That was the sad part. Oprah: Was there any explanation he could have offered that would have satisfied you? Jay-Z: Yes -- and that's why we were able to mend our relationship. Oprah: What was his reason? Jay-Z: When I was 9, my dad's brother got stabbed, and my dad went looking for the guy who did it. People would call in the middle of the night and tell him, \"So-and-so is out here.\" So my dad would get up, get his gun, and go outside to look for the guy. After a while, my mom was like, \"Hey, this is your family now. You can't do that.\" But this was my dad's baby brother. And my dad was in so much pain that he started using drugs and became a different person. So I understand that the trauma of the event, coupled with the drugs, caused him to lose his soul. Oprah: When you saw him again, had he come back to himself? Jay-Z: He was broken. He had a bad liver, and he knew that if he continued drinking, it would kill him. But he didn't stop. Oprah: How soon after you saw him did he die? Jay-Z: A couple of months. I got him an apartment, I was buying furniture. And he passed away. Oprah: Did you instantly make peace with him during that conversation? Jay-Z: Pretty much. I felt lighter. Oprah: The conversation freed you in ways that you hadn't been free before? Jay-Z: One hundred percent. Oprah: Did it open the door for you to have a life with love in it? Jay-Z: Absolutely. Oprah: So what's your personal creed? Jay-Z: Be true to yourself -- and keep things simple. People complicate things. Oprah: My creed is that intention creates reality. Jay-Z: Now I'm having an aha moment! That's true. OPRAH.com: The top 20 things Oprah knows for sure . Oprah: What's the basis of your spiritual belief? Jay-Z: I believe in karma: What you do to others comes back to you. Oprah: But don't you think we're responsible only for what we know? Otherwise, you'd be facing karma for every person you sold drugs to. Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better. But now, if I were to act as if what I did wasn't bad, that would be irresponsible. And I'd have to bear the weight of that. Oprah: Maya Angelou always says, \"When you know better, you do better.\" Do you still think back on that time in your life? Jay-Z: All the time. When you make music, you're constantly on the psychiatrist's couch, so to speak. That's an outlet for me. Because I'm not normally a talkative person. I don't have conversations like this for no reason. OPRAH.com: Read the entire exclusive interview from O, The Oprah Magazine .

Shawna Forde, 41, denies involvement in the shooting deaths of an Arizona man and his daughter. The woman and two men wore uniforms and identified themselves as U.S. Marshals. They claimed the house was surrounded. They said they were looking for an escaped prisoner, Flores' wife told a 911 dispatcher. But there was no backup waiting outside, and no fugitive. The marshals were imposters. They had targeted Flores because they suspected he was a drug trafficker and they wanted to rob and kill him, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. As the intruders searched his home, Flores asked one of the men why his handgun was taped. The man responded by shooting and killing Flores. \"Someone just came in and shot my daughter and husband,\" Flores' wife frantically told 911. She tells the police operator that she was shot and left for dead with her husband, Raul Flores, 29, and daughter Brisenia, 9, who were both shot in the head. Police are not releasing the woman's name to protect her identity. But her 911 call, released to the media by the Pima County Sheriff's Department, tells the story of a deadly home invasion by a rogue band of impostors. As she describes the initial attack, the intruders return to the house. The door can be heard opening. \"They are coming back in! They are coming back in!\" the caller screams. She has armed herself with her husband's handgun. \"Get the f--- out,\" she barks. The order is followed by the explosive sound of gunfire traded as the wounded woman and her would-be killers fire on each other. A man -- one of the intruders -- is hit and groans loudly. The attackers retreat and leave the woman alive and alone with her slain family.  Hear gunfire on the 911 call » . Twelve days later police have the \"marshals\" in custody on charges of first-degree murder, burglary and aggravated assault. Police identified the suspects as Shawna Forde, 41, of Buena Vista, Arizona; Jason Eugene Bush, 34, of Kingman, Arizona; and Albert Robert Gaxiola, 42, of Tucson, Arizona. As police put her into a car, Forde told reporters, \"I did not do it.\" The Pima County public defender's office, which represents Forde, Bush and Gaxiola, did not return CNN's calls requesting comment. Authorities from five different police departments in three states are investigating crimes allegedly involving the trio. Forde's arrest has had even greater reverberations across a community of private citizens who believe the government is not adequately protecting the nation's borders. Forde was a one-time member of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, a citizens group whose self-described mission is to secure the U.S. border, before she started her own smaller border enforcement organization. The accusations against her have given more fuel to Minutemen critics who say the groups dangerously blur the lines between law enforcement and vigilantism. Forde was well known in anti-immigration circles. She ran a failed campaign for City Council in her hometown of Everett, Washington, that touted her connections to the Minutemen. She posted videos on YouTube of her border patrols and was an outspoken fixture at Minutemen Washington meetings and rallies in Washington state. But even among this gung-ho group of self-styled border warriors, Forde was extreme, both Minutemen members and their critics agreed. Washington human rights advocate Luis Moscoso said he had a run-in with Forde during a protest he attended at a 2007 Minutemen conference in Bellingham, Washington. While other Minutemen engaged in a dialogue, Moscoso remembered Forde shouting insults at the protesters. Moscoso later was shocked, he said, to find his photograph and address on Forde's Web site. \"It wasn't a bull's-eye but it was close enough,\" he said. The Web site was taken down after the arrests, so CNN cannot independently confirm Moscoso's account. Eventually, Forde's tactics alienated even the most stalwart proponents of border security. \"The screaming, hollering, calling names, we don't do that,\" said outgoing Washington state Minutemen president Joseph Ray. \"She broke standard operating procedure too many times, she was too damn unreliable.\" The Minutemen kicked Forde out of their ranks in 2007, Ray said. Around the same time, police said, Forde became embroiled in several bizarre incidents that remain under investigation in Everett. Forde's then-husband was shot in the abdomen by an unknown male assailant at their home. The couple later divorced. Forde next said she was the victim of a sexual assault. Later, Forde was found wounded in an alley where she told police she had been shot in the arm by an attacker. Speaking to the media about the attacks, Forde said she was being targeted by Mexican drug cartels for her work guarding the border. According To Sgt. Robert Goetz, spokesman for the Everett Police Department, Forde's sister and mother told police something very different. They believed she invented or played a part in the violence against her and her family. Cast out from the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, Forde formed her own organization called the Minutemen American Defense. Chuck Stonex was a member. Despite \"her cloudy reputation\" in Minutemen circles, Stonex said, he and Forde got along well. Still, he said he noticed during an operation monitoring the border in Arizona with her in 2008 that Forde was well funded for the leader of a tiny group on the fringe of the Minutemen movement. \"She always had a lot of cash,\" he said. Cash was what led Forde, Bush and Gaxiola to Raul Flores' house on May 30, 2009, said Dawn Barkman, a spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff. Flores had a reputation for involvement in the narcotics trade along the border, Barkman said, and Forde devised a plan to bluff her way into his home and rob and kill him to finance her border patrol group. According to Barkman, it was Forde's plan but Bush allegedly fired the fatal shots inside the Flores home. It was not Bush's first slaying, police say. After his arrest in the shooting of Raul Flores, police in Wenatchee, Washington, charged Bush with the fatal stabbing of Hector Manuel Lopez Partida. Homeless and traveling through Wenatchee, Lopez Partida was killed in 1997, stabbed seven times, apparently as he slept on the ground next to a grain silo. Police in Wenatchee found a blood-soaked shirt near where Lopez was killed. Eight years later, advances in forensics testing indicated that Bush's DNA was on the shirt, a police affidavit said. Bush has \"long-standing ties to Aryan Nations groups,\" the affidavit said, and he allegedly bragged to an unidentified police informant about killing \"a Mexican,\" saying he and another man \"stomped\" and \"stabbed\" the man and \"left [him] to bleed out.\" After the shooting at Flores' home, the crime wave continued, police said. A couple who are friends of Forde's mother was robbed at gunpoint of their $12,000 inheritance by men pretending to be U.S. Marshals, said Sgt. John Hubbard of the Shasta County Sheriffs Department. The victims, Hubbard said, identified Bush as one of the gunmen. Hubbard said police believe Forde helped carry out the robbery. In the next town over, Hubbard said, the home belonging to Forde's brother was robbed on the same day. The alleged crime spree leaves Forde's former compatriots feeling exposed and under attack. Stonex said he last saw Forde and Bush right after the shootout at the Flores home. Stonex helped patch a bullet wound to Bush's calf. \"They said they were jumped by border bandits,\" he said. He said had he known about their alleged killing of Flores and his daughter, Stonex would never have had anything to do with Forde. Now, he said, he and other Minutemen have been forced to cancel border patrol operations and wait for the scrutiny to die down. \"It's given us a lot of grief,\" said Stonex, \"I'd build her gallows if I could.\""}

My goal: Memorize its contents, be on TV game shows, win cash and prizes, run away from home, move to Manhattan and become a professional writer. Instead of focusing on getting Mr. Right, focus on finding Life Plan Right, says author. I got as far as Asparagus. To this day, I know a little about a lot of words beginning with \"A.\" Some favorites: ants, atoms, alchemy. Plus, Aristotle was a childhood crush, because I've always loved philosophy. When I finished reading his one-page encyclopedic write-up, I bought books about him. I'd been saving these dog-eared, underlined Aristotle books, as well as the \"A\" book of Britannica, all to be used in a novel, where I'd been planning to bless my protagonist with the quirky detail of knowing all things \"A.\" I recently rediscovered these Aristotle books when moving apartments. I flipped through and was surprised to discover Aristotle said a lot of the same things about love and happiness as modern psychologists. Only Aristotle obviously said it first, having been born at least 300 years B.C. Plus, Aristotle said it truly wisely. Indeed, much of what Aristotle said hit home big-time -- in particular about a sexy, smart, funny, rich, lying, cheating, don't-get-me-started Prince Harming I'd just broken up with. I could almost hear what Aristotle might say to me if we were to chat over souvlaki. 'Sold your soul to be with him' \"Mea bene, Karen,\" Aristotle would say. \"You know what your problem was with your ex? He was not your soul mate -- but your 'sold' mate -- because you sold your soul to be with him. Sure he was sexy, smart, rich, funny -- but alas, he was a liar and a cheat.\" \"You're an intellectual guy.\" I'd correct the regaled philosopher called the \"Mind of the Academy\" by Plato. \"I'm surprised you believe in something as namby-pamby metaphysical as a soul mate!\" Oprah.com: 10 rules to soul mate love . \"Absolutely!\" My fave Greek philosopher buddy Ari would respond emphatically. \"Actually, I sort of coined the concept of 'soul mate.' If there'd been a little TM trademark thingy back in the 300s B.C., I'd be a very rich man today. I firmly believe caretaking the soul is incredibly important for happiness. I describe a soul mate as a 'soul-nurturing mate.' Someone who nurtures your soul, thereby promoting insight and growth. I pushed folks to find soul mates because, in my opinion, real happiness only comes when you stimulate your core self -- and grow into your highest potential. Basically, the soul is the ultimate G-spot for happiness.\" Of course, I'm paraphrasing for my philosopher buddy. But if Aristotle were here, I know he'd agree with my verbal modernization. Plus, Ari would go on to describe how he views the world as offering three kinds of relationships, only one of which brings true happiness. 3 kinds of relationships . According to ancient philosopher Aristotle, there are three kinds of relationships, only one of which will bring you true happiness. Find out how your relationship measures up! 1. Relationships of pleasure . Partners who are about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. You share soulless, passionate sex and playful banter -- but they're about the body or ego. They never soul-nurture you with insight and growth, so they never bring real-deal happiness. Oprah.com: How to break your bad man habit . 2. Relationships of utility . Partners you spend time with in hopes of garnering status, power, money and beauty like the rich guy with a trophy girl. Again, this is about body or ego and doesn't bring true joy. 3. Relationships of shared virtue . Partners who challenge and inspire you to grow into your highest potential and nurture your soul. A good example is when Jack Nicholson's character in \"As Good As It Gets\" says, \"You make me want to be a better man.\" When you prioritize seeking a partner who supports you becoming your best self -- instead of crushing on \"superficial lures\"(hotness, funniness, smartness, success, etc.) -- you wind up with a soul mate/a Prince Charming/a definite keeper! With this in mind, if you want to be happy in love, you must take time to see past a guy's \"superficial lures\" and look inside his \"superinsidehimself.\" Unfortunately, those fumes of chemistry can often dizzy a gal into making stupid love choices. That's why it's important to remember: Hot, steamy chemistry eventually fades -- and what's always left beneath is a person's true soul. Yes, if you want to be happy, you must seek a good-hearted, ethical soul who brings you great growth -- not simply a hottie who brings great grope Oprah.com: The best things to do for your relationship . Confession time: Another superficially alluring quality I've been suckered in by is humor. I am Silly Putty in a friggin' funny man's hands. I once had a boyfriend who teased me that the secret to getting me into bed was to crack five good jokes in a night. He'd count down his jokes as the night progressed. Unfortunately, funniness is a mere decorative quality -- sometimes developed to avoid talking about real-life issues. Which is why in the past, after a few months of dating a friggin' funny guy, I've witnessed all that fabulous ha-ha-ha laughter often gives way to tears when the guy's true character -- true soul -- shows up as one that avoids honest communication, warm empathy and the desire for growth. Then, when I try to connect soul to soul -- heart to heart -- I am greeted by a gigantic, unmovable whoopee cushion wall. Basically, friggin' funny is only the tiniest tip of a person. Meanwhile, a person's soul is a person's foundation! For the record: Aristotle wasn't against finding someone friggin' funny or friggin' sexy or friggin' rich. He believed these pleasure-bringing qualities were good for stirring up passion, which humans need to be our fullest selves! But Aristotle recognized \"superficial lures\" and material goods were simply what he called \"means to the ends\" of happiness, not \"the final ends,\" which is always to grow into your most esteemed self. As Aristotle said: \"Men imagine the causes of happiness lie in external goods. That is as if they were to ascribe fine and beautiful lyre playing to the quality of the instrument rather than the skill of the player.\" Or as I like to say, \"It's just as easy to complain about a rich man as it is to complain about a poor man.\" Basically, it doesn't matter how rich a guy is if his behavior makes you twitchy and miserable. While on the subject of money, Aristotle was no fan of slackers either. He recognized that being or dating poor brought its share of problems. He even admitted the lack of a certain amount of wealth was as much an obstacle to happiness as deprivation of freedom. He gladly accepted that some wealth was needed to be happy -- just as exciting bodily pleasures were needed. But again, wealth and bodily pleasures were mere means to the ends of happiness -- these ultimate ends being to nourish your soul, so you can reach your most esteemed level of self. A big secret to happiness? Stop focusing on finding a Mr. Right! Start focusing on finding Life Plan Right. When a Mr. Potential Right comes along, you must ask yourself if this guy will lead you to Life Plan Right or Life Plan Wrong. As you get to know the guy, look to see if he: . 1. Offers you exciting growth as well as exciting grope . 2. Has developed good character -- so he'll be a positive influence on your character development. If the guy scores two for two, you're likely in Prince Charming territory. Oprah.com: What you could learn from dating 100 men .

Most applicants to creative writing programs submit stories about the angst of their suburban childhoods. This writer's stories concerned the daily ordeals of a boy living with his family on the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, and the horrific plight of a Rwandan girl whose mother is Tutsi and father Hutu. Not only did the applicant have what writers call \"material,\" he was blessed with an uncanny ear for human speech and the poetry to describe his characters' very unpoetic lives. I can still remember the young Kenyan boy watching his mother decant the glue she intends to sniff. The glue, the boy tells us, \"glowed warm and yellow in the dull light,\" and when his mother had poured enough, \"she cut the flow of the glue by tilting the tin up. The last stream of gum entering the bottle weakened and braided itself before tapering in midair like an icicle.\" Still, this applicant gave us pause. The writer had so much to say, he seemed to be trying to channel a raging waterfall through the tiny funnels of two short stories. His use of punctuation was idiosyncratic, to say the least. And the applicant was a priest! Would the other students be willing to share their stories, rife as these tend to be with profanity, drugs and sex, if a clergyman was in the room? And would this particular clergyman understand what all great religious writers know -- that true literature doesn't spring from one's certainties about the universe, but rather from one's questions? That said, how could our students be inhibited by a classmate who didn't hesitate to describe a 12-year-old Kenyan prostitute being paid by rich white tourists to perform sexual acts with their monkey? As to the shapelessness of the applicant's prose and the eccentricity of his punctuation, anyone with this writer's gifts could be taught to structure his material and punctuate his characters' speech correctly. If I still felt apprehensive about having a priest in my workshop, that anxiety vanished when Uwem Akpan walked in the room. Rather than wear his clerical garb and collar, Uwem showed up in a blue and maize University of Michigan sweatshirt. With his wide, gap-toothed smile, wall-shaking laugh, disarming candor and gleeful giggle, he exuded magnetic charm. Nor was Uwem out of place for being the only Nigerian in his cohort. Despite what the judges of the Nobel Prize might say about American writers being too insular to compete with their European counterparts, this country's MFA programs provide one of the only spaces on the planet where writers of many races, religions, nationalities and sexual orientations can come together. Writers find common ground not through the homelands they once inhabited but the thematic questions with which they grapple. Early that first semester, I assigned a story by Philip Roth called \"Defender of the Faith,\" in which a Jewish sergeant who has witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps must decide whether to grant special favors to the Jewish recruits in his command or enforce strict impartiality. I didn't know whether Uwem would connect to Roth's quintessentially Jewish outlook. But the moment the discussion started, Uwem's hand shot up. \"This is the story of my continent!\" he declared. If Africans continued to put tribal allegiances above universal fairness, Uwem said, progress would remain unattainable. This abhorrence of tribalism is what makes Uwem so open-minded. Like most people who are comfortable in their own skins, he is wonderfully able to inhabit the skins of others. One semester, he audited a seminar on Holocaust literature. The professor had no idea who Uwem was, so she couldn't help but be surprised when he asked, \"Can you tell me, please, how is it that people can do such terrible things to one another?\" If anyone else had asked that question, the professor might have thought he was simpleminded. But she could tell that this mysterious stranger was asking his question in the most profound way, from the depths of his own experience. A few months later, Uwem accompanied me to my temple for the Jewish New Year. After sitting -- and standing -- for hours through the service, he commented that he had studied in the Bible how Jesus opened the scroll to read, but he had never quite understood how that worked, so it was beautiful for him to see how the Jews really did that. And he was happy to note what Catholicism had copied from Judaism. Just as Uwem opened his mind and heart to us, I opened my mind and heart to Uwem. An atheist with a degree in physics, I don't believe in prayer. And yet, when Uwem stopped by the evening before a frightening operation on my spine, I granted his request that he pray for my well-being. Startled by the warmth I felt flowing along my spine as Uwem held his hands above my head, I burst out crying. Of course, my colleagues and I never forgot why Uwem was in Ann Arbor, Michigan. During his two years in our program, all of us worked hard to help him develop his many gifts. But mine was the first workshop Uwem took, and I saw his stories at their rawest. As I waded through the reams of rough drafts he had given me, it occurred to me that I had been called upon to help the children of Africa the only way I could -- by helping Uwem to write their stories. We talked about the need to focus each story around a single character's conflict and a single thematic question rather than attempting to convey everything Uwem knew about all his characters. I also urged him to allow his young protagonists at least a chance for freedom or redemption. Yes, the children whose lives he wanted to depict were the victims of adults who abused, exploited and betrayed them. But even in a society in which a child can be prostituted to provide her family's food and pay her brother's school fees, the prostitute's brother might choose to decline that money, to leave the family, to walk away. Uwem listened attentively, but I wasn't sure that he believed what I was saying. I didn't see another version of his story about the street family in Nairobi for several months. When I did, the hairs at the back of my neck stood up. That second version of \"An Ex-Mas Feast\" was so powerful and finely polished that I asked Uwem if he would send it to the deputy fiction editor of The New Yorker, whom I had met a few weeks earlier when the magazine brought its college tour to Ann Arbor. Uwem hesitated -- I didn't know this, but he already had submitted an earlier version of the story, twice, to \"The Editor\" at The New Yorker -- but I kept nagging him until he sent the new version. The rest, as they say, is history. The magazine accepted Uwem's story for its fiction issue. Then, a year later, it published a revised version of the story about the half-Tutsi, half-Hutu Rwandan girl. In many ways, Uwem's success makes sense. Even when he was studying to be a priest, he gave up precious hours of sleep to stay up writing. He applied to an MFA program and got accepted. His teachers recognized his extraordinary potential and helped Uwem to achieve it. And yet, much of Uwem's success is inexplicable. In a world in which so little attention is paid to children's suffering, a world in which fewer and fewer publishing houses remain interested in acquiring literary fiction and independent bookstores, even in college towns such as Ann Arbor, are closing their doors, the editors at every major publishing house in New York competed for the privilege of publishing a book that might not sell many copies but had shaken them to the core. And Oprah ... how could Oprah, who had never selected a collection of stories for her book club, choose a collection like Uwem Akpan's, with its multilingual patois, complete absence of pathos or sentimentality and nearly unbearable-to-read violence toward children? Yet all of this came to pass. Oprah respected her audience enough to assume that if she was so deeply moved by Uwem's stories, they would be moved as well. In choosing \"Say You Are One of Them,\" Oprah brought to Uwem's cause the intelligence and heart of her many readers. That any of this happened at all, let alone in five short years, is a literary miracle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eileen Pollack."}
{"tokens_range": "4k", "total_prompt_tokens": 3710, "how_many_news": 2, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as president January 20, there will be music -- by, among others, Aretha Franklin, Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman and the U.S. Marine Band. There will be prayers and speeches -- including Obama's inaugural address. And for the fourth time in the nation's 56 inauguration ceremonies, there will be poetry -- by someone far less well-known. Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle. After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion. Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama's. She joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- Robert Frost in 1961 for John F. Kennedy's inauguration and Maya Angelou and Miller Williams, who read at Bill Clinton's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations. Alexander has written five books of poetry, including \"American Sublime,\" a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005. Her father is Clifford Alexander, secretary of the Army in the Carter administration, and her mother teaches history at George Washington University. Her brother is an adviser to Obama's transition team. Alexander's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from \"American Sublime\" (Graywolf Press): . Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner, . overhear on the bus, God / in the details, the only way . to get from here to there. / Poetry (and now my voice is rising) is not all love, love, love, / and I'm sorry the dog died. Poetry (here I hear myself loudest) / is the human voice, . and are we not of interest to each other? Alexander spoke Friday to CNN.com. CNN: What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this? Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle. CNN: You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago? Alexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation. ... He was in the law school, and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work didn't really cross so much. ... [We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community. CNN: And you did it by writing? Alexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years. CNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you? Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, \"Isn't that something?\" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, \"I never thought I'd live to see this day.\" The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. CNN: What's ahead of us? Alexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ... The larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better. CNN: Can poetry help in that regard? Alexander: I do believe that it can. The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful, because after all if we can't be precise with language, how can we share ideas? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions. You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem, but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it, those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems. CNN: So you're going to write a poem about health care? Alexander: That would be fun. Of course, this [poem for the inauguration] is an occasional poem, it has to serve the moment, it has to serve the day, right? So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day. But of course, what I hope to do, rather than the laundry list poem, is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done. CNN: Will you show it to anybody before you read it? Alexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first, last and best critic. CNN: You wrote an essay about Gwendolyn Brooks [the Pulitzer Prize-winning African-American poet] in which you said that \"the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society.\" And then later on you said you've seen your work \"overpraised by narrow-minded white critics\" and \"criticized small-mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets I imagined would be pleased by it.\" Your work is read very differently depending on who's reading it? Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received. ... On the one hand, I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture. That's my group, that's who I am, [I'm] proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time, one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky. It reaches people unexpectedly. You really, really can't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work. That's been a real gift to me; it's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work. CNN: You have two children? Alexander: Two sons, 9 and 10. CNN: How do they feel about the poem? Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing. And in the excitement, we still live in our every day, so mommy is still mommy, and all the mommy things are expected of me, and that's the way I like it. CNN: What are your tastes in music? Alexander: Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most, and I mean jazz across the board because that's an incredibly diverse art, and also I must say, R&B, funk and soul speak very powerfully to me. CNN: Favorite artists? Alexander: Thelonious Monk is quite a favorite artist. Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of Duke Ellington. CNN: And Aretha Franklin? Alexander: Can you imagine? I get to hear her at close range. Boy, that's going to be my gift for the year.\n\n**News 2**:\n(OPRAH.com) -- Mindy Perlmutter was having a birthday party, but this was not just your garden variety, chocolate cake, two kinds of ice cream, balloons, and a piñata type soiree. No, this would be an affair to remember. Lisa Kogan has learned the hard way about when it's important to listen to loved ones. This would be even more fabulous than Alicia Mittenthal's tie-dye-your-own-pillowcase gala or Daisy Feng's macramé-your-own-bracelet bash. This was to be a build-your-own-terrarium shindig, complete with colored sand and plastic stones and an incredibly classy assortment of glass goldfish bowls. At the time (the time being about 34 years ago), it seemed like a very big deal --  I mean, let's be honest here, it would still be a big deal to go to a party where you get to build your own terrarium...in, you know, a kind of retro, '70s, ironic, hipster way. So there I sat, looking out the den window, which gave me a clear view to the driveway while I waited for my ride to come spirit me away. Actually, it hadn't been our den since my grandparents returned from their life in Miami Beach and my folks rented a hospital bed to turn the den into my grandmother's bedroom. I loved my grandmother, but I can't say I ever really got to know her. She was the lady who played bingo and walked with a cane and kept a plump red tomato pincushion next to the creaky old foot-pedal-powered Singer sewing machine. I remember that she put up her own pickles and draped strudel dough across the kitchen table, and I know that she learned to reupholster her own furniture and got her first driver's license when she was deep into her 50s, and I'm acutely aware that she spoke to my grandfather in a very stern Yiddish whenever he tried to convince me to watch \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" My grandmother endured an awful lot from the man, but no grandchild of hers was going to be forced to watch Lawrence Welk so long as she still had breath in her body. Anyway, the sun was going down and my ride was running late and my grandmother started to talk. I thought she was going to warn me to be careful of something or other, because she was from the generation who believed that pigeons carry polio and she worried a lot, but if she was anxious about anything that night, she didn't show it. \"I used to love to go to parties,\" she told me. She might as well have said that she used to enjoy scaling Mount Everest in flip-flops and a tutu. I was pretty sure I'd heard all the stories from my grandmother's life --  and none of them involved a party. Oprah.com: How to write your own memoir . The talk I'd heard was always the same: She and her mother and her five brothers and sisters starving through the bitter Russian winters in a little village whose name sounded like a sneeze. I knew about the malnutrition, the crippling rickets, the father who slaved away for years in Detroit trying to earn enough money to bring his wife and children to America and how when he finally did manage to save enough, the man he entrusted with the job of bringing the family over disappeared with the money (was he killed? did he steal it?), leaving my great-grandfather to start all over again. I'd heard how my great-uncles Sam and Isadore would scrounge through fields looking for anything edible while my grandmother supported everyone with her job as a maid to the butcher's wife, and I knew by heart the story of how she lost that job because the woman caught her taking a sip of milk. I also knew how she met Arthur Levy, the love of her life, who my great-aunt Molly swore looked \"exactly like a young Perry Como,\" and that he died a few weeks after she married him, though she never stopped wearing his ring. I knew that the first son she had with my grandfather had died, and that on a Friday afternoon in 1939, her father, the man who worked so hard to bring the family here, died, too, after being pushed off the roof of a building in an anti-Semitic attack. And, of course, I knew that she worked nonstop to build a better life for her children. But I realize now that I only knew those stories because they were told to me by other people. The night of Mindy Perlmutter's terrarium party, my grandmother was telling me the things she wanted me to know. She talked about dances and boys and a silvery blue dress she'd sewn with her sisters. She told me about a time when all her friends were doubled over with laughter because...well, I'm not really sure what it was they found so funny. There was a honk and the glare of headlights, so I gave my grandmother a fast peck on the cheek and flew straight out the door. She went into the hospital the next morning, and she never came out. I sit playing Candy Land with the great-granddaughter Rose Kogan never got to meet. Julia Claire closes her eyes, blows on the dice, and whispers, \"C'mon, c'mon, Mama needs a pair of deuces.\" I have no idea why my 6-year-old sounds like Edward G. Robinson, but I make a mental note to quit letting her play blackjack with the doormen. She rolls \"snake eyes\" and becomes my little girl again. \"I want a do-over, Mommy.\" I start to explain that we don't really get do-overs in this world, that you kind of have to play it as it lays. I believe the parenting books call this a \"teachable moment,\" but my follow-through leaves much to be desired. I hand Jules the dice and say, \"Go for it, kid.\" The truth is, I want a do-over, too. I have ignored my instincts, I have embraced my neuroses, and there have been more than a few serious lapses in judgment over the years -- hell, I once painted my bathroom aubergine. But if I could get just one night back, it would be a chilly October evening when nothing mattered more to me than hanging with my friends in Mindy Perlmutter's basement. Oprah.com: One thing Lisa Kogan would never change . I would have taken off my coat and sat back down, only this time I'd have faced my grandmother instead of the driveway. I would have asked her if the good times outweighed the bad, if there were nights she'd do differently, if she'd ever felt like giving up -- or if that was even an option. I never told her how smart and talented and brave and lovely I thought she was. I never heard what was so great about Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in Mrs. Miniver. I never found out what she did to make her skin so soft and her matzo balls so firm or if she'd have preferred it the other way around. And I never thanked her for being my go-to grandma in the unconditional goodness department. Julia and I finish the game and say our goodnights. I am eager to return a couple of calls, get her lunch packed for school, and watch the episode of \"Mad Men\" I've got waiting on our DVR. But my daughter is feeling chatty. \"Mommy,\" she begins, \"do you know why the Princess Barbie Musketeers have swords that match their ball gowns?\" Before I can answer, she announces, \"It's because they're royal squashbucklers.\" I tell her I'm pretty sure the word is swashbucklers, and she tells me she's pretty sure I'm wrong and goes on talking. She doesn't want to let go of the night, and so I nudge away two stuffed poodles and curl up beside her. The calls and the lunch and even Don Draper can wait, because I have learned the hard way that my job is to sit quietly in the dark and listen to whatever my daughter has to say.

President Obama on Friday explains to reporters the details of a phone conservation with Sgt. James Crowley. The president acknowledged that his words \"helped to contribute to ratcheting\" up the situation when he criticized the manner in which Sgt. James Crowley arrested professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. \"I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge Police Department or Sgt. Crowley specifically,\" Obama told reporters. \"I could have calibrated those words differently, and I told this to Sgt. Crowley.\"  Watch Obama describe talk » . Obama spoke about two hours after police unions in Massachusetts called on him to apologize. He did not apologize for his remark but repeated that he believed his choice of words was unfortunate. He reiterated his assertion that he believes police overreacted, but said Gates \"probably overreacted as well.\" \"My sense is you have got two good people in a circumstance in which neither of them were able to resolve the incident in the way that it should have been resolved,\" he said. Obama also spoke briefly with the arrested professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is a friend of the president, the White House reported. He and Gates had a \"positive discussion\" about his call to Crowley on Friday afternoon, the White House said. Obama also invited Gates \"to join him with Sgt. Crowley at the White House in the near future.\" In an e-mail Friday to CNN's Don Lemon, Gates wrote, \"I was very pleased that the president called me today, and I was pleased that he proposed that I meet with Sgt. Crowley at the White House, since I had offered to meet with him since last Monday. \"I am eager for this to be used as a teaching moment to improve racial relations in America,\" said the e-mail. \"This is certainly not about me.\" His attorney, Charles Ogletree, told Lemon that he applauds Obama's intervention and \"I look forward to working this out with all parties amicably.\" Asked if he plans to file suit, Ogletree said, \"It depends on the response from everyone involved as to how we'll proceed.\" Earlier Friday, police unions said Obama should apologize to members of the Cambridge Police Department for saying they acted stupidly, the president of a city police union said.  Watch African-American colleagues defend Crowley » . Dennis O'Connor, president of the Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association, also took aim at Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who reportedly has characterized the arrest as \"every black man's nightmare and a reality for many black men.\" Echoing the words of Crowley, O'Connor said he was dismayed that the president and governor would opine on the issue without all the details. \"It's noteworthy that both qualified their statements by saying they did not have all the facts,\" O'Connor said as members of his and another police union stood behind him. \"Usually, when one hears those words, one would expect the next words to be 'so I cannot comment.' Instead, both officials, both admitted friends of professor Gates, proceeded to insult the handling of this case.\" He further said Cambridge police resent the implication they allowed race to dictate their actions in the situation. \"We hope that [Obama and Patrick] will reflect upon their past comments and apologize to the men and women of the Cambridge Police Department,\" O'Connor said. Steve Killian, president of the Cambridge Police Patrol Officers Association, also called on Obama to apologize to \"all law enforcement personnel throughout the entire country that took offense to this.\" Crowley previously said Obama had offended police in Cambridge and elsewhere. \"I was a little surprised and disappointed that the president, who didn't have all of the facts by his own admission, then weighed in on the events of that night and made a comment that really offended not just officers in the Cambridge Police Department but officers around the country,\" Crowley told CNN affiliate WHDH-TV in Boston. Obama said earlier he was \"surprised by the controversy surrounding\" his comments. \"I think it was a pretty straightforward commentary that you probably don't need to handcuff a guy, a middle-aged man who uses a cane, who's in his own home,\" Obama told ABC's \"Nightline.\"  Watch Crowley's boss defend the arrest » . When Obama waded into the story by answering a question about it during his news conference Wednesday night, he admitted that he \"may be a little biased\" because Gates is a friend. \"I don't know all the facts,\" he also conceded. He said he did not know what role race played, but \"the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home.\" iReport.com: Arrest sparks debate . But during his Friday remarks, Obama said he hoped the controversy surrounding Gates' arrest provides Americans with \"a teachable moment\" on how they can improve \"relations between police officers and minority communities.\" Crowley, in the police report about the incident, said Gates refused to cooperate with him and repeatedly accusing him of racism when he went to Gates' home following a report of a possible break-in July 16. Crowley said he tried to determine whether there was someone else at the home and wanted to ensure Gates' safety. Gates, however, told him \"that I had no idea who I was 'messing' with\" and was being so loud, the sergeant said, that he could not give pertinent information to the department when he was calling in. Authorities have said they may release tapes of the officer calling in, in which Gates is heard in the background . Crowley's report said that when he asked to speak with Gates outside, the professor at one point responded, \"I'll speak with your mama outside.\"  Watch Crowley's response » . Gates' attorney, Charles Ogletree, said the professor never made such a remark. The full story will show that Gates did nothing wrong -- and that Crowley did not identify himself at first, Ogletree said. Gates said Wednesday he would listen to Crowley \"if he would tell the truth about what he did, about the distortions that he fabricated in the police report. I would be prepared as a human being to forgive him.\" Crowley has said he will not apologize. The police incident report states that Crowley twice provided his name to Gates, who subsequently asked for it two more times. Gates ultimately was arrested for disorderly conduct, but the department later dropped the charges. Cambridge police Commissioner Robert Haas said he \"deeply regrets\" the arrest but stands by the procedures his department followed. \"I trust [Crowley's] judgment implicitly. He is a stellar officer,\" Haas said. Haas added the department is \"very proud about its diversity within this community and how hard we've worked over the years to build a strong, solid relationship [between] the department and the community.\" Haas said he agreed with Crowley about Obama's remarks. \"I have to tell you the officers take that very personally and basically feel hurt by that comment. We truly are trying to do the best service we can to the community and sometimes we make mistakes. We're human. But we learn from those mistakes and we move on,\" he said. Black in America 2: Does racial profiling still take place? Numerous police officers, including African-Americans, have spoken up on Crowley's behalf and portrayed him as a good and fair officer. Crowley, who is white, had once been chosen by a black police officer to teach a police academy course on ways to avoid racial profiling. Obama said he had heard of Crowley's record, saying, \"I don't know all the extenuating circumstances, and as I said, I respect what police officers do. From what I can tell, the sergeant who was involved is an outstanding police officer, but my suspicion is probably it would have been better if cooler heads prevailed.\" Gates' legal team argues that authorities are misrepresenting the professor and the officer, and Gates has said he is determined to keep the issue alive despite the charges being dropped. \"This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,\" he said this week. Ogletree said Gates may bring forward people who say they've had similar experiences with Crowley. When asked for examples, Ogletree said only that they may come out in time depending on how the police department handles the situation moving forward. \"I think you will be hearing much more complex and different perspective on him [Crowley] in the coming days and weeks,\" Ogletree said, alleging that Crowley \"is well-known among people, particularly young people, for some of his police practices.\" Gates has no immediate plans to file a lawsuit against the department, the attorney said. Ogletree had said earlier Gates might sue the police.

Some would-be iPhone developers, rejected by Apple, are turning to an unauthorized app store called Cydia. But some developers aren't taking the rejection lying down: They're turning instead to an unauthorized app store called Cydia, where forbidden wares continue to exist -- and even earn developers some money. That store is operated by Jay Freeman, more fondly known in the iPhone \"Jailbreak\" community as Saurik. Only five months old, his app store Cydia specializes in selling apps that Apple would reject or ban (or already has). To use Cydia or the apps available through it, customers need to jailbreak their phones -- hack them to work around Apple-imposed restrictions -- a process that Apple claims is illegal. Indeed, you can even get a Google Voice app, GV Mobile, through Cydia. After Apple pulled the app from its App Store, developer Sean Kovacs (who is not affiliated with Google) made it available for free through Cydia. It's difficult to get accurate data on how many customers have jailbroken their iPhones. But based on the number of unique device identifiers tracked on his server, Freeman claims that about 4 million, or 10 percent of the 40 million iPhone and iPod Touch owners to date, have installed Cydia. On a recent day, he said 470,000 people were connecting to the Cydia store, up from 350,000 per day just a few months ago. Among many free apps, there are also 15 paid apps in Cydia, and the store has earned $220,000 in overall sales in just five months. \"People are so annoyed by Apple and their s---, and if you give them opportunity to go around it, then they'll even pay for it,\" said Kim Streich, a developer whose app 3G Unrestrictor earned $19,000 in sales in just two weeks through Cydia. Though Cydia is relatively young, the underground \"Jailbreak\" community has existed since the first iPhone launched in 2007. That year, Apple didn't yet have an app store for its iPhone, stifling the true potential of the device. This limitation inspired digital rebels to hack away at the iPhone's closed platform in an effort to free its mind. The result? An app called Installer, opening a door for early iPhone owners to add games, utilities and other third-party software coded by developers. It wasn't until 2008 that Apple offered a software development kit for third-party coders to make programs for its iPhone. That led to the opening of the official App Store in July 2008. Apple's store grew rapidly, accumulating 65,000 apps and serving over 1.5 billion downloads to date. Many developers abandoned Installer for the more popular App Store, leaving behind an underground space where unauthorized wares could continue to exist. Installer died and became reborn as Cydia, which evolved from an app library into a store in March 2009. To gain access to Cydia, iPhone owners must jailbreak their smartphones using some freely available tools courtesy of the hacker group iPhone Dev-Team. Given the nature of this procedure, it's clear Cydia's primary audience consists of nerdy rebels wishing to utilize the full power of their iPhones, restriction-free. Cydia's numbers appear small compared to the rare stories we hear about developers turning into millionaires with hot sales of their iPhone apps in the App Store. But the idea behind a store like Cydia is that you don't have to be huge to make money. With a smaller market, fewer competitors and a reasonably large customer base, each developer has a higher chance for making a quick buck, Freeman said. Plus, you get more personal attention: Developers submitting their app through Cydia need only contact Freeman, and their app can be made available almost immediately. That's an enticing alternative to Apple's approval process, which can take months and is notoriously opaque: Some App Store developers have faced difficulty getting answers to simple questions from Apple about their apps. It's obvious what's driving iPhone customers toward Cydia: Apple's rejections and restrictions of major iPhone apps. Most notably, Apple recently banned apps supporting Google Voice, the search giant's internet-based phone enhancement service that can provide cellphone users with free text messaging and transcribed voicemail. Angry consumers and developers theorize that Apple banned the Google Voice apps so as not to detract business from its partner AT&T's phone services. The incident has brewed so much controversy that even the Federal Communications Commission has gotten involved, sending letters to AT&T, Apple and Google inquiring about the reasons for the rejections. \"Looks like Apple and AT&T pissed off a lot of people,\" Kovacs wrote in a July 28 blog post. \"I'll be releasing GV Mobile v1.2 on Cydia for free today or tomorrow.\" Another high-profile App Store regulation involves SlingPlayer, an app that enables iPhone users to stream video from a Slingbox device hooked up to a TV. When Sling originally submitted the app, it was capable of streaming over both Wi-Fi and the cellular 3G connection. However, Apple requested Sling to modify the app to work on Wi-Fi only. AT&T said this was a necessary move to prevent congestion on its 3G network. That restriction spawned the most successful Cydia app to date, 3G Unrestrictor, developed by Streich. 3G Unrestrictor, a $2 app that has sold 9,500 copies, allows the iPhone to circumvent any network limitations imposed by Apple. For example, the app enables SlingPlayer users to stream TV over 3G as well as Wi-Fi; and when using the VOIP app Skype to place phone calls, customers can also use the cellular connection, whereas normally the app only enables users to dial over Wi-Fi. \"It's just amazing what you can do on such a little cellphone, and Apple just forbids customers from doing these things, and it's just a shame,\" Streich said. \"That's why I'm so happy there's a Cydia store.\" Another developer who reports positive experiences with Cydia is Jonathan Zdziarski, who said he has made more money through the unauthorized store than Apple's App Store. In February, his app iWipe sold 694 copies in Cydia, compared to 91 copies of iErase in the App Store. \"I guess you could say the App Store is kind of like Wal-Mart, with more crap than you'd ever want to buy,\" Zdziarski said. \"And Cydia is like the general store that has everything you want and need, from fresh cuts of meat to those homemade cookies you can't get anywhere else.\" Though some developers say they're having better experiences selling apps through Cydia, it's unlikely they will succeed on a longer term, said Rana Sobhany, vice president of Medialets, an iPhone app analytics company. She said the average consumer would prefer to purchase apps through a well trusted source such as Apple. \"There have been all these apps downloaded in the App Store because it's easy for consumers to find, download and pay for apps,\" Sobhany said. \"This model is new because Apple has been training people how to download music to their iPods for years.\" However, even in the case of the App Store, developers who strike it rich still face challenges recreating their success, said Phillip Ryu, co-creator of the e-book reader Classics, which has sold over 400,000 copies to date. \"If you're hoping to reach the mainstream, the best you can hope for is your app catches on fire and charts high enough for you to make a windfall,\" Ryu said. \"Essentially you aim for the jackpot, and if you don't hit that, it's not going to make you a living.\" Freeman said it was too soon to tell whether Cydia would provide developers stable incomes, but he recommends they give it a try, considering the successes some are experiencing. He admits, however, he isn't making much money as the creator of Cydia: Like Apple, he takes 30 percent of each app sale to cover taxes. \"I don't make much money off this project, but I value the community, and I look forward to how this changes the device landscape,\" Freeman said.

{"tokens_range": "4k", "total_prompt_tokens": 3768, "how_many_news": 2, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\nIf you want to know where American food traditions are headed, look back. Many of today's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday's: Nearby farms offering nutritious, peak-of-season produce; slow-cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods. Sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s, the USDA says. \"It used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage. But today, food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest, most natural way possible,\" says Fern Gale Estrow, M.S., R.D., a community nutritionist based in New York City. \"People still want and need to save time in the kitchen, but they're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it.\" Fortunately, these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful, nutrient-rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements. Flexitarianism . Like vegetarians, \"flexitarians\" eat a primarily plant-based diet composed of grains, vegetables, and fruits, but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat, fish, poultry, or dairy. A quarter of Americans fit the description, consuming meatless meals at least four days a week, according to the American Dietetic Association. Why it's here to stay: Flexitarianism is exactly what dietitians, nutritional researchers, and public health advocates have been recommending for years. \"It's about eating a varied diet that's low in saturated fat and high in fiber,\" says Milton Stokes, M.P.H., R.D., chief dietitian at St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City, and an ADA spokesperson. Because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein, flexitarians are more likely than most Americans to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain. CookingLight.com: Take our quiz on correct serving sizes . What it means for you: Studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. In one large study from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19-year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent, and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent. Locally grown foods . As people seek fresher foods, they have begun to connect with local family farms. Community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs and farmers' markets give consumers direct access to produce, meats, cheeses, breads, honey, and other foods that are produced in nearby communities. In the past 10 years, the number of local farmers' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Marketing Service. Why it's here to stay: Because they are so fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on \"factory\" farms. The latter, which constitutes most of the produce grown in the United States, is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves, and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it's sold, according to Local Harvest, a nonprofit agricultural research group. All that downtime takes a toll. USDA researchers have found that if it's not handled properly, produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit. Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C are particularly vulnerable. What it means for you: \"Buying food from local vendors gives you input,\" says Gail Feenstra, R.D., food systems analyst at the University of California at Davis' Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program. \"You can find out how things were grown. You can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that wouldn't be available elsewhere.\" And then there's the most important reason of all: Because of its freshness, locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped. \"Growers' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation,\" Feenstra says. Functional foods . Functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food. Familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins A and D. As sales of these foods have soared in recent years, more functional foods have reached the market, such as eggs and pastas with omega-3 fatty acids, sterol-fortified chocolates and high-fiber, high-protein flours. Why it's here to stay: These foods help many people fill nutritional gaps. \"For example, if you're lactose intolerant, you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota,\" Stokes says. \"Calcium-fortified juice eliminates that problem, especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet.\" Likewise, if you dislike seafood, you can obtain extra omega-3s from eggs or pasta. CookingLight.com: Remembering real portion sizes . What it means for you: Functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet, not a substitute for it. \"Calcium-fortified orange juice won't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide, like protein,\" Estrow says. \"That's why it's best to rely on whole foods, which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically.\" In the end, it's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food, but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources. Organic food . These are foods produced following a government-regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals used in traditional farming. Organic food is one of the country's fastest-growing market segments; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. Why it's here to stay: Some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost. A research review of 41 studies conducted by the University of California at Davis found that, on average, organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin C, 21 percent more iron, and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods. The kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category's growth, such as cookies, baked goods, and boxed meals, also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness. What it means for you: \"An organic stamp isn't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality, but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated,\" Stokes says. An organic cookie, for example, may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie. But in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides, such as peaches, apples, and strawberries, choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals, according to tests conducted by researchers from the Environmental Working Group in Washington, D.C. CookingLight.com: All-star foods that fight for health . Slow food . Launched in Italy 20 years ago by restaurateur Carlo Petrini, \"slow food\" was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle. The trend's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items, preparing them in traditional ways, and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast-paced, eat-on-the-run lives many people lead. Why it's here to stay: As with locally grown food, freshness is a key component of the slow food trend. \"Investing the time to choose what's fresh that day will ensure that night's meal will be at its peak nutritionally,\" Stokes says. This principle applies whether you're making a family recipe or dining in a restaurant where the chef selects ingredients based on their seasonal availability. Family togetherness is also an important aspect of the trend. \"Slow food is all about cherishing the eating experience and getting back to what food used to be: a vehicle for drawing people together,\" explains Sara Firebaugh, assistant director of Slow Food USA. What it means for you: Healthful whole foods are a great start, but slow food goes a step beyond good nutrition -- and it's a difficult one to quantify. No scientific studies have conclusively proven that friends and family make better dinner companions than televisions, but the benefits are clear. \"Slow food embraces the psychological component in food choices, meal preparation, and the act of eating,\" Estrow says. \"A healthful diet isn't just about what you eat but how you eat it.\" E-mail to a friend .

She lives in New York City.\n\n**News 2**:\nAtlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- As Christmas season went into full swing this year, Glen Fullmer's 7-year-old son came home from school with an assignment: Make a poster illustrating his family holiday traditions. The boy wasn't sure how to proceed because he and his family are Baha'is, not Christians, and they have no holidays during the Christmas season. Thus, Fullmer encountered the \"December Dilemma\" -- the term used for the quandaries and anxieties non-Christians and interfaith couples face during Christmas season. Fullmer, a Baha'i faith spokesman who lives in Evanston, Illinois, said he saw the poster assignment as a \"teachable moment\" for his 4-, 7- and 10-year-old sons who associated holiday traditions with Christmas. He reminded his boys that Baha'is have a gift-giving and charity period in February called Ayyam-i-Ha, a stretch of time not unlike the Christmas season. And he helped his son design the poster about that holiday, which precedes a fasting period and then the Baha'i New Year in March. \"His classmates asked him questions about the holiday, and one of his friends came up to him and wants to celebrate that holiday,\" Fullmer said, pleased that his son's peers helped him reaffirm his identity. Navigating the Christmas season can be a challenge for the millions of people who don't celebrate the holiday. Many acknowledge and sometime embrace the season's customs, such as gift-giving and sending out greeting cards, while at the same time they are conscious of maintaining their own religious identities. \"They strongly try to maintain their own integrity, but they really want to find bridges across holidays,\" said the Rev. Dr. Paul Numrich, a professor at the Theological Consortium of Greater Columbus in Ohio. \"I think that's the majority.\" L.S. Narasimhan, chairman of the Georgia Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, is a Hindu and doesn't celebrate Christmas. But he said he admires the Christian celebrations of his friends and has attended Christmas Eve services at several churches. \"Hindus are typically more open-minded and tolerant. Hinduism is very comfortable in accommodating a diversity of ideas,\" he said. \"It is very common for Hindu families to have Christmas trees at their homes, purely as a fun thing to do for their children. When they visit shopping malls, Hindu parents in general are comfortable with a photo-op for their little kids with Santa.\" But at the same time, there are pressures about the encroachment of Christianity on Hindu life. \"Television commercials, good selection of merchandise and great sale prices persuade Hindu-Americans to take advantage of the shopping spree,\" Narasimhan said. \"Several Hindu temples have risen up to the challenge and added some special Hindu prayers and ceremonies to engage Hindus who are on winter holidays but not on overseas vacations.\" Dr. Shefali Chheda, an Atlanta-area pediatrician, is a Jain -- practicing a religion with Indian roots. Growing up in Houston, Texas, she said her parents \"felt comfortable letting us celebrate Christmas,\" perhaps to help fit into American society and maintain a sense of normalcy. \"The spirit and meaning of Christmas, of helping others and of giving, are nice messages. Therefore, it is hard to consciously object to it,\" Chheda said. \"Jains, as a whole, are a minority in India. Many Jains celebrate Hindu holidays, so celebrating Christmas with Santa and a tree and presents is no different. Since Jains wholeheartedly believe in 'ahimsa' -- peace toward all living beings in thought, word and action -- the Christmas spirit is a very Jain-like philosophy.\" The religious aspect of Christmas -- believing Jesus is the savior and that December 25 is his birthday -- is not celebrated in Jainism, but the customs and symbols are interwoven into daily life, she said. \"Now that I have toddlers in the house, they come home with stories about Christmas. They sing songs about Rudolph and Santa, and Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah. But it's Santa that everyone talks about, so they talk about him as well,\" Chheda said. \"I use Santa as a behavioral modification tool. 'Santa's watching you, so you better be good' works infinitely better than timeout. My kids will be living in this country; they will have a hard enough time anyway with their names and food and other cultural traditions; Christmas -- and the Christmas spirit -- is not one tradition that I want to take away from them.\" Jesus plays a role in the theology of other religions, such as the Baha'i faith and Islam, even though those faiths don't observe Christmas as a religious holiday. The Christmas season presented a struggle for Haris Tarin, director of the Washington office of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee. He grew up in Los Angeles, California, area schools, where he sang the ever-present Christmas carols and made the gingerbread houses in schools but didn't have a tree in his home. \"We definitely had a little bit of anxiety in childhood,\" Tarin said. But that changed as he grew up and refined his American Muslim persona amid the American atmosphere of diversity and tolerance. Now, where he and his family live in northern Virginia, \"we don't celebrate Christmas. We celebrate our holidays\" -- pointing, for example, to Eid al-Fitr after Ramadan and Eid al-Adha after the hajj pilgrimage. But he welcomes the goodwill of the season -- the gift-exchanges with non-Muslim neighbors and the requests from schoolteachers to talk about Muslim holidays. \"There's definitely going to be a level of discomfort, especially for those who aren't used to that diverse culture that we belong to,\" he said. But the unease spawns discussion, presenting a useful opportunity to help young people and newcomers, he said. For Jews, the eight-day holiday of Hanukkah happens to fall during the Christmas season. Hanukkah is wildly popular and observed, with its special foods, gift-giving and candle lighting, and with its symbols such as the menorah -- a candelabrum -- and the dreidel, a toy that spins like a top. Compared with other non-Christians, many Jews have drawn a sharper line in the sand when it comes to observing Christmas, a stance informed by historic, theological and self-preservation reasons. That attitude emerged recently during a young professionals' get-together at an Indian restaurant outside Atlanta sponsored by the American Jewish Committee and Young Indian Professionals. People there indicated that attending Christmas-themed holiday parties, exchanging greeting cards and wishing Christian friends \"Merry Christmas\" are surely not uncommon or unacceptable among Jews. But some practices are widely shunned -- such as plunking one's child on Santa's lap at the mall, and deplored -- such as assigning kids in public schools to write a letter to Santa Claus. \"It's a beautiful season. It brings out a joy,\" said Hannah Vahaba, who organized the Jewish-Indian event. \"But I'm not going to celebrate it.\" Interfaith couples celebrate their diversity during the Christmas season. Jeff Silver, a certified public accountant who is Jewish, and Shweta Gupta, a dentist who is Hindu, are planning their marriage next year. They will have an interfaith household and said they hope to raise children to understand both of their traditions. At their home in Atlanta, they've set up a holiday tree decorated with Hindu and Jewish ornaments. Non-religious Americans embrace a December \"secular holiday\" called HumanLight. Patrick Colucci, vice chair of the HumanLight Committee and member of the New Jersey Humanist Network, said the holiday can uplift \"atheist, humanist and nonreligious\" people who feel left out and isolated during Christmas. It was a perfect fit for him when it came along, he said, because \"it corresponds with my humanity-based ethics and values, without any supernatural or theistic beliefs. My 'holiday season' is HumanLight and New Year's Eve -- that's what I celebrate.\" \"The only dilemma, in my experience is, if Christmas is part of the larger family tradition, and then some family members reject us for not believing in it anymore. We're not out to take Christmas away from anyone who wants to celebrate it -- there is no 'war on Christmas,' \" Colucci said. How do Christians themselves see the presence and practices of non-Christians during Christmas? While many would like to see non-Christians convert to Christianity, they also recognize that the United States is a \"diverse society\" and that conversion \"is not even on their radar screen,\" said Numrich, the theology professor. \"There's a deep American virtue in respecting religious differences,\" he said."}

But for some of us, travel is best expressed through celebration. We prefer to exchange culture over the clinking of glasses and between the flashes of strobe lights. Conversations punctuated by \"Prost!\" and \"Salud!\" show us more than any guidebook. I view myself as a kind of international nightlife connoisseur. As an entrepreneur, author and all-around life enthusiast, I've been around the world many times over. And of everyone I know, I feel the most qualified to throw an absurd list like this together. Each city is judged on four criteria, each given a score from one-to-10 . 1. Hours. How late each night and how many nights per week is the party good? 2. People. Is it a good crowd -- cosmopolitan, friendly and, yes, good looking? 3. Music. Judged on quality and variety offered in each city. 4. Experience. How likely you are to have an experience that you'll still be telling your friends about a decade from now. I'm embarrassed to admit how much time I spent on this list (seriously, there was an Excel spreadsheet involved), but I finally narrowed it to 10 cities and I'm confident with the end result. First, my honorary mentions: Hong Kong, Sydney, Miami, Stockholm, Tokyo and Tel Aviv. My apologies party people, but the competition was stiff. 10. Bangkok . Hours: 7 . People: 5 . Music: 5 . Experience: 10 . Total: 27 . A lot of travelers continue to pass through Bangkok not realizing there's more to it than the seedy dregs of Soi Cowboy, or the backpacker haven of Khao San Road. Bangkok has developed a vibrant and classy side as the city has become more cosmopolitan. Whether it's a series of gorgeous rooftop hotel bars downtown, rock bars near Ratchathewi, dance clubs just off Sukhumvit or trendy pubs in Thlonglor and Ekamai, there's legitimate, quality adventure to be had. Best place to mingle with the locals: The young kids prefer RCA, while many of the city's beautiful people are drawn to the clubs on Sukhumvit Soi 11 or upscale Ku De Ta, among others. 9. Buenos Aires . Hours: 9 . People: 7 . Music: 6 . Experience: 7 . Total: 29 . \"The Paris of the South\" puts a New World spin on the insane Spanish practice of eating dinner at midnight and then dancing until dawn. While living there, I remember trying to go home as the sun came up and an Argentinian friend telling me she wanted to go to an after-party instead. It was eight in the morning. On a Wednesday. Although not as affordable as it used to be, Buenos Aires is still a relative bargain among major world cities. The locals love good rock music, too. Best itinerary: Start with the calmer bars of Recoleta and work your way up to the taverns of Palermo Hollywood. There's no rush, believe me. 8. Las Vegas . Hours: 8 . People: 8 . Music: 6 . Experience: 9 . Total: 31 . A staple. No nightlife list would be complete without it. Sin City has something for everybody, from NBA power forwards blowing their signing bonuses to middle-agers gambling their way through a midlife crisis. I tend to stick to the southern end of the strip -- Marquee, XS, Tao -- but it's hard to have a bad night out in Vegas. Best place to waste your life savings and love every second of it: XS in the Encore. Get to this nightclub early or suffer through the two-hour line. 7. Montreal . Hours: 8 . People: 8 . Music: 8 . Experience: 8 . Total: 32 . Montreal is the undiscovered party gem of North America. Beautiful, friendly people, all night dancing to a wide variety of music. And, of course, the summer festivals. Obvious tip, but still good to keep in mind: Don't go in winter. Best place to learn why the French do it better: Wood 35. Good drinks, good food. 6. Barcelona . Hours: 9 . People: 8 . Music: 8 . Experience: 7 . Total: 32 . The first rule of Barcelona is that you don't stay on Las Ramblas. The second rule of Barcelona is that you don't stay on Las Ramblas. Guidebooks and pub crawls funnel the least savvy visitors there. Other parts of the city are far more interesting at night. Well, early morning. Clubs don't get going until well past 1 a.m. each day. Most of the top clubs are scattered throughout the northern part of the city. Best place to wake up early for: Row 14. Doesn't get going until 6 a.m. 5. London . Hours: 9 . People: 6 . Music: 10 . Experience: 7 . Total: 32 . The world epicenter of corner pubs touts some of the ritziest and most prestigious nightclubs in the world. You can enjoy fantastic music almost any night of the week here. And there will always be the pubs. Best place to suffer local pretension: Chinawhite. Tell them you know a promoter named Becker even though you don't. You might get in. 4. Sao Paulo, Brazil . Hours: 9 . People: 9 . Music: 7 . Experience: 8 . Total: 33 . Sao Paulo is the dark horse on this list. Often overshadowed by its more beautiful and glamorous sister, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo is actually the cultural hub of Brazil. The city's glory isn't apparent upon arrival. The place isn't beautiful. But dig into the sprawling concrete mass and you'll find greater diversity and intensity on a nightly basis than almost any other place in the world. Best place to dance with a hot Brazilian until he/she has to go straight to work: D-Edge on a Thursday after 1 a.m. 3. New York City . Hours: 7 . People: 10 . Music: 9 . Experience: 8 . Total: 34 . Although it's not true that the \"city never sleeps\" (it's usually done by 3 or 4 a.m.), New York City scores big simply because it offers something for everybody on any night of the week. Warehouse parties in Brooklyn, mega-clubs in Meatpacking, trendy hipster joints in the East Village, hotel lounges, college bars, indie rock shows, loft parties, hip hop and jazz, heavy metal and opera -- there's almost no limit to the ways this city entertains you. Best place to buy a single drink for more than you spend on some nights out: Meatpacking District. Bring a credit card. 2. Berlin . Hours: 10 . People: 6 . Music: 10 . Experience: 9 . Total: 35 . If a city's mental health was determined by how many hours of the week its clubs weren't active, Berlin would be a lunatic in a straightjacket, repeatedly slamming its head against a padded wall. Witness: walking out of a venue at 9 a.m. on a Sunday to find that there's still a line to get in; a club with beds installed on its bottom floor so patrons can sleep without the inconvenience of having to leave; ceilings made completely of LED lights; a swimming pool next to the dance floor; bouncers with face tattoos. Best place(s) to experience the big-club vibe: Berghaim. If you can't get in (it's random), then Watergate. 1. Ibiza, Spain . Hours: 10 . People: 9 . Music: 9 . Experience: 9 . Total: 37 . Every party hound must make a pilgrimage to Ibiza at least once. The venues aren't as much clubs as they are life experiences. Nowhere else have I seen a wind tunnel built into a dance floor or parade floats and foam dropped from the ceiling like it's the Fourth of July indoors. In Ibiza, you do beach parties during the day, hotel bars in the evening and dance to the best DJs in the world all night. Sleep not recommended. Best place to have an out-of-body techno experience: The clubs in Ibiza Town (rather than San Antonio) are worth the extra expense. Tell us about your own favorite party cities in the comments. Originally published November 2012, updated September 2014. Mark Manson is an author and entrepreneur.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- He was the football star who came to symbolize one of the reasons why many argued Qatar shouldn't be allowed the right to stage the 2022 World Cup. On Friday, a year to the day since he returned to Paris following his painstaking exit from Qatar, Zahir Belounis will take a moment to remember the scarring experience of being trapped inside his Doha apartment for months on end. \"I cannot forget what happened...my head is still in that place,\" former French-Algerian football player Belounis told CNN. \"I never did anything wrong but my life was ruined and for what? \"Perhaps I don't understand the seriousness of what I achieved in getting out and being able to tell my story. \"It's not just about me -- it's about all the people like me who have also suffered.\" Last year, on November 28, Belounis was reunited with his mother and family after returning to France along with his wife Johanna and two small daughters. Belounis had become the face of the struggle against \"kafala\" -- the system which ties employees to a specific employer within Qatar. Fiercely criticized by pressure groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, \"kafala\" has been labeled as facilitating modern day slavery, though recently Qatar said it had been making progress in reforming the system. Stranded in Qatar following a 18-month pay dispute with football club El Jaish, Belounis was finally allowed to leave the Gulf State after a lengthy campaign by human rights groups and those on social media. Belounis, who had plied his trade in the lower divisions of French and Swiss football, moved to Qatar in 2007 and initially enjoyed success. In 2010, he was offered a new five-year contract and signed the deal with the ambition of taking El Jaish into the nation's top division, which he achieved the following year. But once El Jaish was promoted, Belounis was sidelined and told he would not play again. There started the problem with his contract -- the club paying him only a small amount of what he was owed until the money stopped completely. For 18 months he struggled to feed his family, desperately contacting the French government and President Francois Hollande for help while he also sent an open letter to Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane, two of the most famous men in football. The Qatari Football Association denied Belounis' allegations, stating that it had helped him recover unpaid wages from a previous club in the country and said the player had not lodged a complaint against El Jaish. In telephone conversations with CNN before he left Qatar, the footballer confessed he had been driven to drink and suicidal thoughts. Even now, some 12 months later, it remains a difficult subject, both for him and his family. \"As a mother, there is nothing worse on earth than seeing your son screaming for help, crying on the phone, hearing him on TV, on radio,\" Zahir's mother Fouzia told CNN. \"Of course I was aware that he wasn't held by some sort of terrorist group, but I felt like that every day. \"The worst was the article saying he was suicidal, but I want to forget that day, it is haunting me until today.\" A photograph of Belounis emerging from the arrivals zone at Charles de Gaulle airport and moving almost immediately into the arms of his mother went viral online as the two embraced while cameras flashed and popped. \"I remember that night,\" said Belounis. \"I was alone in the bathroom and just remember thinking, 'I've had to come back to my mum's house like a kid.' \"I had my wife and children and here I was, back at home. It wasn't right. \"I was a grown man forced to crawl back to my mum -- it was embarrassing.\" Belounis suffered from anxiety as he struggled to adjust to his new found freedom. \"When he arrived in Paris, he was like a traumatized animal, scared of everything,\" his brother Mahdi told CNN. \"It was almost impossible to make him smile or laugh.\" Unable to settle in Paris, Belounis moved to Malaga in southern Spain where he found work at his friend's restaurant -- as a waiter. \"In life you have to work,\" he said. \"My friend wanted to help me and I am so grateful towards him. \"At first it was difficult because I was used to the good life, being a professional football player. \"But now I have learned the trade and I respect the job of a waiter. I've learned about the restaurant and I am grateful, although I never expected to finish my career like this.\" Last week, Qatar was back in the headlines after winning the right to host the 2019 World Athletics Championship. The decision was met with criticism by human rights groups who are unhappy at the Gulf State's treatment of migrant workers. In a statement, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months. \"A new sponsorship law, currently under review, that will replace the outdated \"kafala\" system will be announced by next year,\" said the statement. \"We are also working on laws to cover domestic workers. \"As in every country in the world, change does not happen overnight. Significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish, but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in Qatar. \"Our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year.\" While Belounis says he is encouraged by these developments, he is anxious to witness greater progress. According to a report by DLA Piper and confirmed by the government, 964 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013. The International Trade Union Confederation has estimated that 4,000 workers could die while working on projects by the time the 2022 World Cup begins. According to the Qatari government, there are over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country. \"Qatar's system is not a human system,\" Belounis said. \"I think they have no choice but to make changes now. \"The last time I heard the Emir speak, he said lots of good things but we want to see some action. We have to do something other than talk. \"I am a victim of the 'kafala' system and the rules need to be changed so it will never happen again.\" Belounis is still awaiting news from the French justice ministry in his claim for unpaid wages against Qatari club El Jaish, though he insists his is a struggle that isn't just about money. \"This is about human rights. I hope one day I will see justice and that the Qataris will come out in public and admit they made a mistake. \"I want an apology. It's the only thing which will finish this episode.\" Both his mother and brother are desperate for Belounis to put his time in Qatar behind him. \"Zahir is ready to fight even if we have to go to the European Court,\" said Mahdi. \"This isn't just about Zahir, it is about hundreds and thousands of people who are in the exact same position that he was once in. \"He is the symbol of this human disaster.\" Meanwhile, Zahir's mother is very much aware of the emotional torment her son has experienced. \"I can see it in his eyes, because I know my son. And I felt he was internally destroyed and fragile. \"I lost the kid full of joy I knew from before. It will take time, but I will get him back, I am sure. As for Zahir he still has flashbacks -- the nights of sleeping on the floor in his Qatari home, crying while he held his daughters, remain fresh in the mind. Even now, the picture of his two young girls asking, \"What's wrong daddy?\" haunts him. The depression which led him to ponder suicide might have lifted but the memories haven't. \"I know that it will be a year since I came back but I just want to be alone,\" he said. \"I remember telling my little girls that 'Daddy doesn't have any strength to fight anymore' but here I am. \"I am proud of what has happened to me and to be the first to highlight this problem. \"Perhaps I haven't fully realized what I've done...but I will sit tomorrow night and I will remember.\"\n\n**News 3**:\nWashington (CNN) -- One of the first things President Obama did after Republicans seized control of the Senate was to announce his intention to seek new Congressional authority for military action against ISIS in Syria and Iraq to replace those passed more than a decade ago to wage the war on terror. The President said he would begin consultation with lawmakers on an Authorization of the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, while Democrats still control the Senate. But he added, \"it may carry over into the next Congress.\" The new found enthusiasm for engaging Congress could be viewed as either olive branch to the incoming Republican Senate to answer accusations he doesn't consult enough, or a belief Republicans will be more forward-leaning on granting authority that has made some members of his own party nervous. But it precludes what is sure to be a bolder role for Republicans in U.S. foreign policy. Here are some of the things to watch as Republicans take over the Senate majority in January: . THE PLAYERS - The three Senate committees with oversight over foreign policy will now be chaired by Republicans. DEFENSE -- John McCain ascends . Sen. John McCain is widely expected to head the Armed Service Committee. He has long sat on the committee and also been its ranking member, but this will be his first time being in charge of it. As one of the staunchest critics of President Obama's Syria strategy, the gavel gives McCain a greater platform to push for more aggressive military action against but ISIS and President Bashar al-Assad. McCain would also play a key role in writing the defense authorization bill, which sets policies on everything from defense spending to weapons systems to military base closers. Although the appropriations committees control the purse strings, McCain would have a larger say in how the Pentagon spends its money. The Navy veteran has blasted the Pentagon about what he considers expensive, outdated and ineffective weapons systems, and is expected to be outspoken on reforming Pentagon spending, he has pressed to replace defense budget cuts under sequestration. Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said despite McCain's criticism on the administration's handling of foreign policy issues, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel enjoys a \"strong and productive\" relationship with McCain. That relationship would exist despite the public ringer McCain put Hagel through during his 2013 confirmation hearings. Despite his reputation for blunt talk McCain is also known for reaching across the aisle and officials believe restoring the failed 2008 Republican presidential nominee to a position of power could see a return to the statesman-like McCain of years past. FOREIGN RELATIONS -- Corker is a deal maker . Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee is likely to replace New Jersey Democratic senator Robert Menendez, who wasn't seen as particularly friendly chair to the Obama administration. Corker has criticized Obama for being an \"unreliable ally\" and blasted the president for withdrawing his request to launch military strikes last year. Corker also wants the administration to get tougher on Russian President Putin. Despite his conservative credentials, Corker is known for his willingness to work with Democrats on issues foreign and domestic and has a good relationship with Menendez, the current chair. During an editorial board with his hometown newspaper the Tennessean, Corker laid out a thoughtful argument for broad US engagement in the world and suggesting he would support an increase to the US foreign aid budget. INTELLIGENCE -- A fresh start with Burr . Sources say Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina will likely take the gavel from Diane Feinstein, who has had a rocky relationship with CIA Director John Brennan. Their disagreement is over the agency's meddling into a Senate investigation into Bush-era interrogation techniques and a long-awaited report on the issue. The administration could actually find a friendlier chair in Burr on the interrogations report, as well as on surveillance programs and the use of drones. He also expected to be less forceful on pushing for reform of NSA data collection called for in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations. Burr will also likely dive into the threat posed by ISIS, including improving weak intelligence on the number of foreign fighters who may have U.S. passports. SYRIA and IRAQ -- A debate on the use of force . Republicans supported President Obama's decision to order airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria this summer. And incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he is open to a Senate floor debate on a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). Discussion is likely to intensify over what the GOP considers a tentative and ineffective campaign against the terrorist group. Republicans charge that President Obama, by not acting sooner, contributed to ISIS growth. They have argued that defeating the group now will require more boots and Special Forces on the ground, increased airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and a no-fly zone and buffer zone in Syria. Republicans also want to more forcefully confront Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. There is also sure to be scrutiny of the administration's plan train moderate rebels. The White House has asked Congress to train 5,000 voted Syrian rebel troops to take on ISIS, and the current authorization for that program expires at the end of the year. Incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday the Republicans want to revisit the discussion with the president on his strategy. That strategy could include cooperation with Iran, which would create a new sideline debate on Captiol Hill. President Obama wrote a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader pointing out the two countries both oppose ISIS. But the ongoing and troubled nuclear talks between Iran and the West stand in the way. IRAN'S NUKES -- Opposition to Obama's strategy . The deadline for an agreement between Western nations and Iran to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for easing some sanctions is weeks away. It's resolution is far from certain. President Obama said Wednesday world powers presented a \"framework\" to Iran for a deal. Senate Republicans are opposed to any agreement allows Iran to continue enriching any uranium and could now pass anti-Iran legislation which would effectively derail a diplomatic solution. If a deal is reached the White House could choose to bypass Congress entirely. President Obama has the authority to suspend U.S. sanctions without congressional approval, a move which could force Republicans to more forcefully confront Iran. Republican senators Corker, John McCain, and Marco Rubio have already proposed legislation that would compel President Obama to submit any deal with Iran to a full up-or-down vote, and Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina said he would not \"tolerate\" a deal with Iran without such a measure. President Obama demurred when asked on Wednesday, saying if there was a deal on the table he would engage Congress. \"I think that we'll be able to make a strong argument to Congress that this is the best way for us to avoid a nuclear Iran.\" Democrats could also make things difficult for Obama on Iran. Proposed legislation enacting even stricter sanctions against Iran is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. The Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013 would expand the number of blacklisted sectors of Iran's economy, expand the number of senior officials in Iran and penalize foreign institutions that do business with Iran's blacklisted entities. The White House fears such legislation would push Iran away from the negotiating table, alienate it's international partners and effectively kill the and deny President Obama what he had hoped could be one of the most important foreign policy achievements of his presidency. RUSSIA and UKRAINE -- More help for Ukraine? There may be little practical effect of a new Republican Senate on policy toward Russia. President Obama has already taking a tough line against President Putin over his actions in Ukraine. Republicans, particularly McCain, paint Putin as a dangerous enemy who must be contained and are likely to push against any future engagement with Russia and a return to a Cold War Stance. Republicans could also increase pressure on the White House to provide arms to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression and increase support for Georgia and other emerging democracies in Eastern Europe. GUANTANAMO -- More difficult to close . President Obama campaigned in 2008 on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, calling it a stain on America's reputation around the world. Those hopes are now all but gone. Congressional restrictions prohibit the administration from spending any Pentagon money for transferring detainees for imprisonment or trail has tied the president's hands. Republicans are the most passionate opponents of closing Gitmo and are likely to continue to thwart the closure of the facility, pressing the administration to try alleged terrorists before military tribunals. TRADE -- Possible new partners . For the White House, this could be a potential silver lining of a Republican-controlled Senate. Two key trade deals are being negotiated. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is an expansive free trade agreement between Asian and North and South America. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a broad free-trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. Republicans could make those negotiations smoother by giving the president \"fast track\" negotiation authority, eliminating the need for amendments Democrats are seeking on behalf of labor. While Republicans may be reluctant to hand President Obama what would be considered major accomplishments, both trade agreements could result in greater U.S. economic growth and jobs which are Republican priorities.\n\n**News 4**:\n(CNN) -- KYRA PHILLIPS: The president said Ebola is a national security priority. How are you responding to that? GEN. DEMPSEY: Well, it is a national security priority. I'd be happy to explain why. But let me speak to how we're responding to it. We're responding to -- I actually held a roundtable months ago because I -- a very bright staff officer on the Joints staff came to me and said this is different. This outbreak is different. It's different because it's urbanized, it's different because it's a third strain of the disease. It's different before of the fragility of the infrastructure, of the governments in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. And so we brought in a panel of experts and we started talking about how this could evolve. And we did some parallel planning. That's what we do, right, we plan. So AFRICOM, General Dave Rodriguez began planning for what we could do to empower and enable civil authority. You know, this is not a mil -- it's not a military threat. But the military has some pretty unique capabilities to deal with all kinds of issues. We can provide command and control, that is to say, a central location with communications and computers and bandwidth that can help people see the situation. So command and control. Secondly is logistics. We've got the finest logistics infrastructure in the world. So we've got a command and control headquarters in Monrovia. We've got an -- an intermediate logistics staging base in -- in Dakar, Senegal. We're building a training center in Monrovia. Now, you might say, why are you building a training center? That's another thing we do very well, we run good boot camps. So we're going to run a boot camp for health care workers coming from all over the world, using the Medicine Sans Frontieres program of instruction, to give those health care workers confidence that they know what they're up against and how to follow the proper medical protocols when they're in the hot zone. We actually are not going to play soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen in contact with patients, but we're putting an architecture around them that will allow the health care workers to do what they've got to do. Related: Get up to speed on the Ebola outbreak . PHILLIPS: So how are you going to protect the U.S. military troops that are there and prevent them from bringing this home? DEMPSEY: Yes, that's a great question. And we're going to -- first of all, we're not going to wait until they're there. So we also know how to train. And so we've got a -- we've got a system of training events prior to deployment, during deployment and during deployment, we tier them in terms of the -- the risk that they may be in contact with somebody with Ebola. So the logistician sitting in Senegal is highly unlikely to be in contact with anyone from -- from Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia. So they're in a lower risk category. And we manage them differently. Those in a high risk category, we manage them better. when they get ready to come back, there will be a period of observation before they come back. And then when they come back, there will be a 20 wait -- a 21 day period of observation when they're back here. Now, here's what sets us apart. Most everybody else self-monitors, right? There's nothing self-monitor about the way the military treats our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, coast guards. We'll be -- we have a chain of command. There are some staff sergeants, some 32-year-old mean as a snake staff sergeant who every day is going to look his soldiers -- I'll use soldiers, but it's the other services, too -- in the eye and make sure that they're not in any way exhibiting symptoms related to Ebola. And so we will use the chain of command to monitor, supervise monitoring from the time they leave until the time they come back and beyond when they come back to make sure we're giving our -- our -- our young men and women the best possible chance to protect themselves and also avoid the -- to avoid but not eliminate entirely the possibility that they would bring something back. Related: U.S. troops assisting in Ebola response may be quarantined . PHILLIPS: Big picture, I'm just going to throw it out there. DEMPSEY: Yes? PHILLIPS: With this Ebola situation and -- and all the major gaps in the system that we've seen, even the CDC director said that the agency should have taken control of that Dallas hospital, what does that tell you about the US' -- the US' capability to respond to a bioterror attack? DEMPSEY: Well, we -- this won't surprise you, that we, through NORTHCOM, Northern Command, we have a command in the continental United States, it sits in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Its mission is to support the home -- well, it has a defensive mission to the homeland related to long-range aviation, to missiles and rockets and -- but it also has a very important mission to provide direct support to civil authority. And we have a contingency plan for managing pandemics, that is, things that would begin to exceed the capability of a particular community or a state even to deal with it. And we update it periodically. And this is one of those cases where we're -- we're dusting it off. We're very closely in contact with all -- National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Agency for International Development for the stuff going on overseas. We are in the planning business and we're deeply into it with regard to this. But it's very much a mission assigned to civil authority. PHILLIPS: So what do you say to all the Americans that are looking at this Ebola situation and are in absolute panic? DEMPSEY: Well, I say a couple of things. One, the -- Ebola is a, to use a sports metaphor, this needs to be an away game. And that's why the United States military is involved. We want to keep this -- we want to help international health organizations, service organizations and non-governmental organizations. We want to help them keep this in isolation inside of those three countries. But there is a risk that if we -- if we, collectively, the international community, failed to keep it isolated, that -- that it could become actually -- you've heard all the experts. I don't need to compete with them for, you know, to sound like I slept at a Holiday Inn Express last night. But I have studied this thing. And there is a risk that it -- that the -- the rate of reproduction, the -- the ability of one patient to affect first two and then four and then eight and then it becomes exponential. so we've -- we've really got to be aggressive about the isolation and treatment matters that we're taking up. Inside the homeland, again, we're in support of those. But I can promise you that the United States military will do its part, with civil authorities, to keep this thing from coming to our homeland. And then inside of the United States, we've got to count on the civil organizations that are responsible for health care. PHILLIPS: Are you, General Dempsey, worried about Ebola here in the U.S.? DEMPSEY: I've been worried about Ebola globally for about 90 days. And I have had some on my staff that were probably a little more worried than I was even a few weeks or months before that. PHILLIPS: Why? DEMPSEY: I'm worried about it because it -- because we know so little about it. You know, you'll hear different people describe whether it could become airborne. I mean if you bring two, you know, two, uh, doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room, one will say, no, there's no way it will ever become airborne, but it could mutate so it would be harder to discover. It actually disguises itself in the body, which is what makes it so dangerous and has that incubation period of about 21 days. Another doctor will say, well, if it continues to mutate at the rate it's mutating and if we go from 20,000 infected to 100,000, the population might allow it the opportunity to mutate and become airborne. And then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem. I don't know who's right. I don't want to take chance, so I'm taking it very seriously."}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7545, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won't cooperate. At a Costco in suburban Maryland on Wednesday, Obama amplified his call for an increase in the minimum wage. He then traveled to Pennsylvania for another event staged around the economy. \"Americans overwhelmingly agree, nobody who's working full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty,\" the President said. \"And that is why I firmly believe it is time to give America a raise.\" Obama heads to Wisconsin and Tennessee on Thursday, continuing a tradition of selling his policy prescription directly to the public after the ceremonial report to the nation. Vintage Obama . In his address on Tuesday, the President talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary, but his words also showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant Congress. \"Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged,\" he said near the end, seeming to describe 2013 - when his approval ratings dropped. \"But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress.\" It was vintage Obama, blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders. There were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code, spend more to rebuild roads and bridges, bolster education and avoid war if at all possible. He said what? Obama's speech explained . Oratorical skills . He brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, a disabled war veteran who sat next to First Lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation. Even Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill. \"A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex,\" said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \"The worst there ever was is still excellent.\" According to a snap CNN/ORC International poll, 44% of respondents had a \"very positive\" response to Obama's speech, while 32% described a \"somewhat positive\" response and 22% didn't like it at all. Last year, 53% of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive. An optimistic goal . The underlying theme of Obama's fifth State of the Union address was his call for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014, and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year. \"Let's make this a year of action,\" Obama said. \"That's what most Americans want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.\" It's an optimistic goal for a President with a 43% approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the Republican-led House of Representatives with congressional elections looming in November. Search the transcript of Obama's speech . \"What I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class,\" Obama said. \"Some require congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I.\" Going it alone . On issue after issue, he invited Congress to work with him but said he also would go it alone. Obama called for more government support to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, but also said that \"I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.\" The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers. While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people, Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America. Opinion: Can Obama deliver action on inequality? GOP responds . Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner chafed at such unilateral action, telling reporters that Republicans are \"just not going to sit here and let the President trample all over us.\" In the official Republican response, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington complained that Obama's policies \"are making people's lives harder.\" \"We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs,\" she said. Agreeing on immigration . One area of possible progress is immigration reform. Obama got a long ovation when he urged Republicans in the House to join Democrats in passing a Senate plan that got bipartisan support. McMorris Rodgers also brought up the issue backed by some Republicans as a way to bolster their weak support among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority demographic. \"We're working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest, and hardest working from around the world,\" she said in describing the more limited GOP approach to the comprehensive Senate measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country. CNN Poll: Speech watcher reaction less positive than previous years . Disagreeing on Obamacare . On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support. He cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits. \"The American people aren't interested in refighting old battles,\" Obama said. \"Let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans. ...The first 40 were plenty. ... We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what we're against.\" In her response, though, McMorris Rodgers continued the GOP attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment. This year's State of the Union is a defining test for Obama . The CNN/ORC poll indicated 59% of respondents thought Obama's policies as presented in the speech would help the economy, a lower figure than in recent years. Laying out goals . Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee \"a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.\" It will be available to those whose jobs don't offer traditional retirement savings programs, he said. Additionally, Obama called for: . -- Eliminating $4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries \"that don't need it\" and instead \"invest more in fuels of the future.\" -- Equal pay for women, noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns, which he called \"wrong\" and \"an embarrassment\" to prompt loud and long applause. -- Setting new fuel standards for American trucks to help reduce U.S. oil imports \"and what we pay at the pump.\" -- Reworking the corporate tax code. He urged Congress to work with him to close \"wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here\" and instead \"lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home.\" -- Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay so the prison can be closed in 2014. Obama also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from Congress that would derail talks on preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, adding that \"for the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.\" Brazile: Obama's message: A dysfunctional Congress, but we'll get it done anyway . Increasing minimum wage . Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat. Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour. Republicans largely oppose any federal increase, saying it will place a burden on employers. \"This is definitely the President's agenda and has been for some time now,\" said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore, it was hard to see big things happening in 2014. John Edwards says Dems should do more on poverty . CNN's : Adam Aigner-Treworgy, Keating Holland, Leigh Ann Caldwell, Chelsea J. Carter, Becky Brittain, Brianna Keilar, Jim Acosta, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Jake Tapper and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- Ten years and 1.2 billion users into its existence, there's no question that Facebook has changed our lives. Whether it was an inspired vision, deft execution, a bit of dumb luck or a combination of all three, Mark Zuckerberg's social juggernaut has ingrained itself into the daily lives of digital-age users in a way that forebears like MySpace and contemporaries like Twitter could only imagine. Which is not to say it's all \"likes\" and \"shares\" and happy kid pics. As with any new (or newly discovered) technology, the impact of the end product is largely in the hands of the user. We are, after all, only human -- with all the joy and sadness, decency and ugliness that that entails. So here, as Facebook turns 10 on Tuesday, is a look back at five ways the social network has changed us -- for better and for worse. Share! Share! Share! The good: Wedding announcements? Thing of the past. Birth announcement? Just slap an Instagram shot of that bouncing baby boy or girl on your timeline. Dating? Graduated? Bought a house? Got a puppy? Same deal. We take it for granted now, but the ability to share major events with all the people closest to you with a single click of the mouse is unprecedented. There were the Myspaces of the world before Facebook. But mom, your second cousin and Aunt Jenny weren't on them. And it's not just the good stuff, either. Changing that relationship status to \"single\" can save you from those awkward \"How's Joey doing? You two are so cute together!\" conversations. The bad: Overshare! Overshare! Overshare! Seriously. Ten years in, some folks haven't figured out what everyone on their friends list wants, or needs, to know. OK, sometimes those pictures of your dinner look delicious. Sometimes. But the detailed updates on your mundane day are mind-numbing and the play-by-play of your 3-year-old's potty training is just -- too much. We all want to know you got a wedding ring. The fact that you just polished the one you've had for 14 years? Not so much. The past is not really past . The good: When a site has 1.2 billion users (OK, we all know some of those are multiple or abandoned accounts, so let's say at least a cool billion) it's a pretty amazing database of the world's Web-enabled population. That means your odds of finding just about anybody are a heck of a lot better than they were 10 years ago. There have been the remarkable tales, like the woman who -- after years of failed efforts -- reunited after 44 years with her birth mother. How long did it take on Facebook? Two days. For most of us, it's less dramatic than that. Childhood friends who moved long ago, college roommates who drifted away, even former teachers who served as inspirations are now but a quick search away. There's no doubt we have friends because of Facebook that we wouldn't have otherwise. The bad: Sometimes, drifting apart isn't a bad thing. Yes, your old high-school classmates got annoying and your cousin's politics disgust you. But we're not talking about that. We're talking about exes. And past flirtations. And cheating. Nostalgia is part of life. But, with Facebook, getting nostalgic about an old crush or flame could lead to a late-night Facebook message. Or, you know, a poke. \"I see Facebook issues breaking up marriages all the time,\" Gary Traystman, a divorce attorney in New London, Connecticut, told the Wall Street Journal. More than 80% of U.S. divorce attorneys say they've seen an increase in cases involving social media, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and one-third of all divorce filings last year contained the word Facebook, according to a survey by Divorce Online. Temptation is always out there. But with Facebook, it can be a little too convenient. It makes you happy . The good: In 2009, a survey of 2,600 college students by researchers at the University of Texas showed that those who were the heaviest users of Facebook were the most satisfied with their lives. They also were more likely to be engaged socially and politically. More recently, a University of Wisconsin study showed that, after five minutes of looking at their own shiny Facebook profiles, users experienced a significant boost in self-esteem. A 2011 Cornell University study delivered similar results. \"For many people, there's an automatic assumption that the Internet is bad,\" associate professor Jeffrey Hancock said at the time. \"This is one of the first studies to show that there's a psychological benefit of Facebook.\" The bad: Or maybe it makes you unhappy. Other studies have looked at aspects of Facebook use and the results have been less encouraging. Last year, a University of Michigan researcher found that looking at posts by Facebook friends -- you know, the photos of smiling kids on vacation in the Caribbean or announcements about promotions, engagements and awesome nights on the town -- can make us feel sadder about our own humdrum lives. \"On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection,\" the study reads. \"Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.\" As with many things, your mileage may very. But what's clear is that Facebook has become such a part of our lives that it tweaks our emotions, for better or worse. Every day is a reunion . The good: Reuniting with classmates from high school or college has never been easier. Pre-Facebook, a class reunion committee looking to celebrate five, 10 or 20 years post-diploma faced a thankless task. \"Where does Jennifer live these days?\" \"Who has Steven's phone number?\" \"Do you know Wanda's married name?\" Now? One Facebook event invitation and you can focus on booking the best '80s cover band available. The bad: If every day is a reunion, why have a reunion? Actually reuniting with old classmates is losing some of its appeal when we know the names of the former theater club president's three kids and which character from \"The Hunger Games\" she'd be. Timothy Davis, co-founder of reunion website Classreport.com, told the Baltimore Sun that he has noticed a drop-off in the number of reunions in recent years, particularly among folks in their mid- to late 20s. \"People I haven't talked to in years will see my wedding pictures on Facebook, then I'll see them in person and we won't say one word to each other ...,\" Rebecca Miller, a 23-year-old whose five-year reunion fizzled to a small party at the class president's house, told the paper. \"Why go to a high school reunion when you're going to stand around and go, 'So, how did that doctor's appointment go yesterday?'\" Privacy . The good: For those willing to find and use them, Facebook provides tools that let you select who sees what. So, while grandma is welcome to look at those pics of the kids playing in the snow, she might not need to be privy to your strongly worded rant about the cable guy who is two days late. You can direct that one instead to buddies with a proper appreciation for your expansive vocabulary. Rival Twitter is designed by default to be a public forum, where you broadcast your 140-character pearls of wisdom to the world. Facebook allows that, too, but is more geared toward limiting your thoughts to certain family and friends. The bad: Well, you know. Security breaches have been a reality of many websites' growth. But as its user base grew dramatically, Facebook's problems (like the time CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg got his own page hacked) played out in front of a massive, and nervous, audience. While Facebook has privacy settings that let users protect information, some privacy advocates say the network doesn't make them easy enough to find and use. (Facebook has worked to ease those concerns, especially for younger users). At the end of the day, Facebook benefits when you decide to share more openly. The details about your life that you share on Facebook are rounded up and compiled into a profile of you that helps advertisers target you with things they think you'll like. So, when you announced your pregnancy and were, soon after, bombarded with Facebook ads for a bunch of baby stuff? That was no coincidence. To be clear, Facebook is not handing advertisers information about you personally. But, somewhere, there exists a nameless profile of a user with your hometown, gender, age and likes and dislikes, just waiting to be used for marketing purposes. That, in a nutshell, is the entry fee to use this remarkable social tool. Yes, Facebook has changed the way we communicate. Whether it is truly cost-free remains another question.\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- After sushi and ramen, Japanese beef is on the list of must-eats for many visitors to Japan. But other than knowing that it tastes great and costs a lot, many tourists turn up with little knowledge of what to expect from Japanese beef. Considered the caviar of beef in Japan, Wagyu (which literally means \"Japanese cow\") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline. There are four Wagyu breeds: black (accounting for more than 90% of Wagyu beef), brown/red, shorthorn and polled. In recent years, efficient marketing efforts have elevated Wagyu to near-divine status among foodies. But they've also led to confusion about what Wagyu is and what separates Wagyu beef from the even-more heralded Kobe beef. Here's help for beef eaters visiting Japan. What is Wagyu beef? For more than 200 years during the Edo Period (1603-1867), Japan's isolation from the outside world ensured the purity of its livestock, which over time became more and more homogenized. When the country opened to world trade in the subsequent Meiji Era, Wagyu breeding accelerated. Unlike cattle in other countries, which are often bred for a range of traits, Wagyu were and are raised with one goal in mind: supreme flavor. \"Genetics is everything,\" says Jason Morgan, owner of The Meat Guy, a Nagoya-based meat importing business. Wagyu's striking characteristic is its pervasive marbling. Achieving optimum and evenly distributed fat is a slow process. Wagyu are typically bred for upward of 30 months. By contrast, most United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) beef comes from cattle that's about 22 months old. The fattening period is longer than it is on most Western ranches. Wagyu cows eat plentifully and frequently. Japan's lack of vast pastures means Wagyu tend to live a sedentary life, which also contributes to generous marbling. Wagyu grades . Japan has a sophisticated numbering system for tracing each piece of beef produced. The National Livestock Breeding Center (NLBC) maintains records on each cow's ancestry, birthplace, ranch location, fattening days and other details. Restaurants can usually provide a 10-digit tracking number for any steak upon request, which has a code that links directly to the NLBC database. In addition, the Japan Meat Grading Association gives each carcass a score based on its yield (A-C) and level of marbling, firmness, color and overall quality (1-5), with A5 being the highest possible mark. Most Japanese Wagyu beef is in the A4-A5 range. Wagyu yields and pricing . All the care that goes into raising Wagyu cows translates into consumer prices that are typically higher than in many Western countries. Visitors to Japan should expect to pay anywhere from Â¥5,000 ($46) to upward of Â¥15,000 ($138) per person for a meal of authentic Wagyu beef. At the Oak Door Steakhouse at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo, meat designated F1 (a mix of two pure breeds, such as Wagyu and Angus) is more popular than pure Wagyu beef because it's cheaper yet still yields good quality. \"Eating Wagyu is considered an investment,\" says Troy Lee, chef de cuisine at Oak Door. \"F1 is the most-consumed beef in Japan. \"For most families, Wagyu beef is a delicacy reserved for special occasions.\" Wagyu cows have a high yield of prime cuts. \"In the United States, you can only use three of four cuts for steaks, whereas in Japan you can get high-quality beef from nearly all parts of the cow,\" says Morgan. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity. NLBC figures put the total Wagyu population at around 1.7 million cows as of December 2012, compared with roughly 33 million beef cattle in the United States. How to eat Wagyu beef . Most chefs recommend Wagyu steaks be cooked a little longer than those from Western countries -- medium-rare or even medium. Otherwise, \"they can be like eating a stick of butter,\" says Lee. Steaks aren't the only way to enjoy Wagyu. Traditional preparation methods include sukiyaki and shabu-shabu, one-pot dishes that render out more of the fat than grilling. Sukiyaki simmers thinly sliced beef in a pot with vegetables, usually bathed in a sauce made with soy sauce, sugar and sake. A raw egg is served with the dish, used for dipping the beef after it's extracted from the broth. Shabu-shabu is a light and healthy meal made with strips of meat even thinner than those used for sukiyaki. The beef strips are briefly cooked in a simmering kombu kelp broth. Finally, there's beef tartar or \"nigiri Wagyu sushi,\" though this is a relatively rare preparation in Japan. No matter how it's prepared, virtually all restaurants in Japan have a signature dipping sauce or sauces, which often contain miso, sesame or citrus juice. Wagyu beef myth: Fatty means unhealthy . Health-conscious eaters may be wary of the web of fat (called \"shimofuri\") woven through slabs of Wagyu. However, pure Wagyu contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids (aka \"the good fats\") rich in Omega-3s. One study from the Japan Livestock Industry Association says Wagyu has up to 30% more unsaturated fat than Angus cattle. You may have heard about the fifth \"primary taste\" on top of sweet, sour, salty and bitter: umami, a term and concept that originated in Japan, which describes a subtle sweetness and aroma. The presence of unsaturated fats is what makes Wagyu beef so full of umami goodness. Wagyu cows are rarely, if ever, given antibiotics. One of the primary purposes of administering antibiotics, says Morgan, is to make an animal more feed-efficient. This philosophy runs counter to the goal of Wagyu ranching, which is to raise fat, hungry cattle. Myth 2: Japanese cows drink beer and get massages . While it's true that the Matsusaka Cattle Council's website advocates using beer to stimulate a cow's appetite in humid summer months and massages for uniformity of fat and improved circulation, it cites no actual case studies. At best, these techniques may be used sporadically by small-scale farms. Some ranches may use sake to enhance the luster of an animal's coat and Japanese TV programs have depicted ranches with prongs in cattle pens that animals rub up against to simulate a massage. But we remain skeptical. While it's amusing to entertain notions of Wagyu cows happily guzzling beer while receiving rubdowns, there's no evidence to suggest such practices have ever been commonplace. The Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association states that neither massages nor the feeding of beer or sake to cows is part of its standard rearing methods. \"How's he going to feel a massage through his leather jacket, anyway?\" asks Morgan. Myth 3: Wagyu beef and Kobe beef are the same thing . A common misperception is that all Wagyu beef is Kobe beef. In fact, only .06% of beef consumed in Japan bears the Kobe distinction, and only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade. It wasn't until February 2012 that the first Kobe beef shipment was sent outside Japan -- to Macau. The first (small) export to the United States was in November 2012. Wagyu beef types are named for the region in which the cattle are raised, including, confusingly, Kobe. For the impressive level of marbling in its Wagyu beef, the Kansai region produces the three \"king\" varieties: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty, says Lee of the Oak Door. Kumamoto Wagyu, for example, comes from the rare Japanese brown breed and is a good choice for those seeking a leaner cut. Although many ranching outfits in Australia and the United States are now raising Wagyu crossbreeds, only four facilities in Japan are certified to export Wagyu beef to the United States. So, the easiest and tastiest place to get authentic Wagyu beef remains Japan. Just one more reason to visit.

And these monuments just keep getting bigger. The Nepalese government recently unveiled the world's largest trident -- a religious statue depicting Shiva -- at a Hindu temple in Dang. The trident is made from five different minerals, weighs more than six tons and stands 12 meters (42 feet) tall. It joins an already impressive roster of Hindu, Buddhist and Christian statues built around the world -- including these 10 greats. Lord Murugan Statue (Selangor, Malaysia) This statue, measuring 42 meters (137 feet) in height, is said to be the world's tallest depiction of a Hindu deity. Fifteen skilled sculptors from India carried out construction on the Lord Murugan Statue, found outside Malaysia's famed Batu Caves. The statue took three years to complete and the finished product -- made up of 250 tons of steel, 1,550 cubic meters of concrete and 300 liters of gold paint -- was unveiled during the annual Thaipusam festival in 2006. Incidentally, it's just meters away from what must rank as one of the world's strangest statues -- a five-legged bull. Batu Caves, Selangor, Malaysia; +60 3 6189 6284 . Christ of the Abyss (Key Largo, Florida) This 2.6 meter (8.6 foot) submerged bronze statue of Jesus Christ in Key Largo, Florida is one of three created by Italian artist Guido Galletti (the others can be found in the waters off Grenada in the Caribbean and in the Mediterranean sea near Italy). The statue weighs 260 kilograms and is held in place with a 9-ton concrete base. It was dropped into place in 1965 and its location, just seven meters below the surface of water, means that it's visible to swimmers as well as scuba divers. It's also a highlight of the local glass-bottom boat tours. John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, Key Largo, Florida; +1 305 451 6300 . Tian Tan Buddha (Hong Kong) This enormous statue -- the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha -- took 12 years to complete. It's located next to Hong Kong's Po Lin Monastery, regarded as the territory's center of Buddhism. Tian Tan Buddha stands 34 meters (112 feet) high, weighs 250 tons and can be seen from as far away as Macau. Beneath the Buddha are three floors that are said to contain the remains of Shakyamuni, the sage on whose teachings Buddhism was founded. There is also an enormous carved bell that's rung every seven minutes, symbolizing the release of 108 kinds of human vexations. Po Lin Monastery, Ngong Ping, Lantau island, Hong Kong; +852 2985 5248 . Leshan Giant Buddha (Sichuan, China) This 71-meter (232 feet) stone statue was built during the Tang dynasty and can be found at the confluence of the Minjiang, Dadu and Qingyi rivers. Construction of the Buddha, which forms part of a UNESCO-listed site, started in 713 AD, though it wasn't finished until 803. A local Chinese monk called Haitong believed that the presence of a stone Buddha would calm the rivers it overlooked. Funding ran out and Haitong killed himself in despair, but when a local governor decided to undertake completion of the project, Haitong's wish came true -- though not quite in the way he intended. During construction, so much rock was removed from the cliff face and deposited in the river below that the water became shallower and easier to navigate. Leshan Giant Buddha, Mount Emei Scenic Area, Leshan, Sichuan, China; +86 833 230 2296 . Laykyun Setkyar (Monywa, Myanmar) Myanmar's Laykyun Setkyar is one of the largest statues in the world, with a height of 116 meters (380 feet). Construction of the statue, which depicts the Gautama Buddha, started in 1996 and finished in 2008. There are 32 stories within the Buddha, 12 of which are dedicated to detailed descriptions of hell. Khatakan Taung, Monywa, Myanmar . Christ the Redeemer (Rio de Janeiro) This 30-meter (98 feet) Brazil icon weighs 635 tons and was constructed between 1922 and 1931, although the concept for such a statue was first brought up in the 1850s. However, in 1889 the country became a republic and, with the separation of church and state, the idea was dismissed. In 1920 the Catholic Circle of Rio started collecting donations from Brazilian Catholics to fund the construction of the statue, commissioning local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa to design it. It has lightning rods on the arms, head and hands -- on average, it's hit by lightning 12 times every summer. Parque Nacional da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; +21 2491 1700 . Cristo de la Concordia (Cochabamba, Bolivia) The Cristo de la Concordia is the second-largest statue of Jesus in the world and the third largest statue in the southern hemisphere. At a height of 33 meters (one for every year of Christ's life), it's just a few centimeters higher than the Christ Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. On Sundays, visitors can climb to the upper section of Cristo de la Concordia for breathtaking views from observation decks located inside the arms. Av de la Concordia, Cochabamba, Bolivia; +591 4 422 8530 . Sendai Daikannon (Sendai, Japan) This gleaming white statue located in Sendai, Japan, is the sixth tallest statue in the world and depicts a Japanese Bodhisattva, or enlightened being. At 100-meters high (328 feet), she holds a wishing stone in her right hand and a water jug in the left. An internal elevator allows visitors to access the higher sections. Travel tip: The statue faces Sendai station, which is in the center area of the city, so if you ever get lost simply follow the statue's gaze to the center of town. Sendai Daikannon, Sanezawa, Izumi-ku, Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan; +81 22 278 1227 . Wat Pho's reclining Buddha (Bangkok) Located just meters from Bangkok's Grand Palace in the Wat Pho temple complex, this reclining Buddha measures 15 meters (49 feet) high and 43 meters (141 feet) long. The most ornate parts are the feet, which are inlaid with mother-of-pearl panels featuring symbols that represent the Buddha, including flowers, elephants and tigers. Above the statue is a seven-tiered umbrella representing the state of Thailand and 108 bronze bowls are placed along its length. Visitors are invited to make a wish as they place a coin in each of the bowls. All donations go towards maintenance of the Wat Pho temple. Wat Pho, 2 Sanamchai Road, Grand Palace Subdistrict, Pranakorn District, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 2 226 0335 . Buddha Dordenma (Thimphu, Bhutan) When completed, this gold and bronze sculpture will be one of the tallest Buddha statues in the world, with a height of 51 meters (169 feet). Originally due for completion in 2010, it's now hoped that work will finish next year, by which time, $47 million will have been spent on construction. China's Aerosun Corporation is covering this cost. The interior will house 125,000 smaller Buddhas and a meditation hall. Buddha Dordenma, Kuensel Phodrang, Thimphu, Bhutan; +975 2 328 295 ."}

Sabrina Allen was a month away from turning age 5, and the visit with her non-custodial mother, Dara Marie Llorens, was supposed to last only a weekend in April 2002, as part of a court agreement. But that weekend visitation in Austin lasted 12 years and finally ended Tuesday, when Mexican and U.S. authorities said they found the girl and her mother living in seclusion in a small apartment in a town between Mexico City and Puebla. The mother will face charges in Travis County, Texas, said Dan Powers, an FBI assistant special agent in charge in San Antonio, Texas. So much time has passed that Allen's daughter is all but grown, now 17 years old. Moreover, his daughter has been told over the years that her father was \"a bad guy\" and \"a wife beater\" -- all false accusations, Allen declared. But Allen never gave up hope. He began a website dedicated to his daughter: FindSabrina.org, which offered a $20,000 reward. He hired a private investigator. And he pressed his public campaign so relentlessly that people wondered whether he was going too far. \"I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,\" Allen said of his pursuit. \"I've had people say, \"Of course, she's with her mother; what's the big deal?' \"People just don't understand,\" he said. \"I was accused of overstepping my bounds.\" A confidential informant . On Wednesday, Allen was euphoric over his daughter's recovery. He learned the news while at the dentist Tuesday and had to rinse his mouth. The police action resulted in a minor injury to a federal Mexican police officer who was involved in the arrest of Llorens, 44, according to Philip Klein, a private investigator retained by Allen. Llorens was located in Mexico through information from a confidential informant, Klein said. But Sabrina Allen has been through so much emotional trauma that she isn't allowed to immediately see her father. She's in solid physical health but hasn't been in school for a while, her father said. She is now under the care of a clinical psychologist in Texas. \"I haven't gotten to see her yet,\" Greg Allen said Wednesday. \"She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,\" he said, becoming tearful. \"She's just not ready to see me and my family. I hope and pray that's coming soon, and I can't predict it.\" He described the 12-year hunt for his daughter as a tormenting odyssey. \"It's a long road. You don't know what the outcome is,\" Allen said. \"I told myself the hardest thing to learn was that I could have a life while looking for her.\" When Sabrina Allen is eventually allowed to reunite with her father, she will discover that she has a new family who has heard so much about her but has never met her: Greg Allen's new wife and their children. \"We hope to have her home as soon as possible,\" Allen said. How his daughter was taken from him began on April 19, 2002, according to the website dedicated to his once-missing daughter. A weekend outing . On that day, Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with her daughter during a scheduled weekend visit, the FBI said in its wanted bulletin for Llorens. Llorens was supposed to return the daughter to her father two days later. He was the primary guardian, the FBI said. The father's website doesn't specify why the relationship between him and Llorens didn't work out, but the site alleges that Llorens has a mental illness. \"Dara's court ordered psychological evaluation indicated that she has a well-established personality disorder, and that she is likely to act in her own interest, instead of Sabrina's,\" the website charges. Llorens and her attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. On the day Llorens was scheduled to return Sabrina, the mother failed to appear at the pickup site, the FBI said. Llorens had moved from her residence in north Austin and left a false forwarding address, the father's website said. Llorens didn't even contact work when she disappeared with Sabrina Allen, the webpage said. Warrants and wanted posters . Later that month, a Texas warrant was issued for Llorens, accusing her of interference with child custody, and then a federal warrant was issued in May 2002, charging Llorens with unlawful flight, authorities said. Llorens even became wanted by the FBI, which published a public bulletin describing her as someone who \"may walk with a mild limp\" and \"may have travelled to Mexico, where she has ties.\" On his website, Greg Allen described her as a thin, petite woman who \"typically does not keep a job for more than six months\" and \"may be likely to take a retail sales job.\" Sabrina Allen was listed on the FBI poster as every bit a little girl: 3-foot-6 and 35 pounds, with pierced ears, a mole on her right knee and a small scar on the bridge of her nose. See a copy of the FBI wanted poster (PDF) Her father described her as a cheerful child who liked \"Barbies, bugs, dress-up, movies, Snow White and Scooby-Doo.\" \"Sabrina has many friends and a large, loving family in Austin. She is very dearly missed,\" the father's website says. The case briefly came to the attention of CNN in November 2002, when host John Walsh of \"America's Most Wanted\" appeared on the network. When Walsh was told that Sabrina Allen had been missing seven months, he said, \"We have a chance of getting her back. She was taken by her ... mother, and that little girl we may be able to get back. But it's by pictures ... that's how we get missing children back, by exposure like this.\" Meanwhile, her father pressed authorities and media outlets about his missing daughter. He even posted photo galleries of him and his daughter on the website. \"This is my school picture. My Daddy says, 'What a big girl,' \" one photo caption says. \"It's my fourth birthday. Who says I'm not a princess?\" another says. Trying to hide in Mexico . While his daughter and her mother lived in Mexico, the girl went by \"Blanquita,\" the diminutive of Blanca, one of the several aliases that Llorens was using, according to the father's website said. The FBI also alleged that Llorens used many aliases. Despite the use of Spanish names, the father asserted that his daughter and her mother would not have blended in Mexican society: Lloren's Spanish was \"poor,\" and their daughter \"does not look at all Hispanic,\" the father said on his website. In fact, Sabrina Allen's middle name is Fair. \"It is unlikely that they could hide in a Hispanic community without standing out,\" Allen said on his website. But Sabrina Allen was repeatedly disguised, right down to her eyebrows and eyelashes, which were dyed, as was her hair, the website said. Sabrina's natural blonde hair was colored red and other hues on varying occasions, the father's website said. As friendly and outgoing as the little girl was, the act of being spirited away imposed an emotional toll on her, the website charges. \"It is reported that she is sometime(s) distant and burdened with the secrets she is being made to keep,\" the website said. \"It is reported that Sabrina has lost weight and is suffering physically and psychologically.\" At one point, Llorens apparently enrolled her daughter in the preschool Tegui in Colonia del Valle in Mexico City, and Sabrina reportedly learned how to speak Spanish \"very well\" and to read and write the language, the father's website said. A promising moment came for Greg Allen when Sabrina Allen and her mother were spotted in Mexico City, on June 13, 2003. But they eluded authorities. It would take 11 more years before authorities finally caught up to Sabrina Allen and her mother. What now remains to be seen is how much of her father Sabrina Allen remembers -- and how much of his great hunt for her she'll come to fathom. CNN's Justin Lear and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- Twice she has been felled by life-threatening illnesses -- a brain tumor and then cancer -- and twice Criquette Head-Maarek has recovered. For her, the secret to recovering full health is simple -- a love of horses. \"Horses were the cure when I was ill,\" says the veteran trainer, a pioneering female figure in the male-dominated racing world. \"With the brain tumor, the doctor told me life was 50-50, a one-in-two chance,\" she added, reflecting on her first serious illness in 1990. \"For me, that was enough of a chance to come back. It's like a race, you're never beaten until you cross the finishing line.\" A month after surgery to remove the brain tumor, she was back working with the horses in her stable -- and did the same again following her cancer scare in 2005. \"They were my drug, my cure,\" says Head-Maarek, whose horse Treve will compete in Sunday's prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris, where she won by five lengths last year to claim European racing's biggest prize. \"I'm not scared of dying, I've had a fantastic life and don't have any worries. A lot of people have cancer and die young but I'm 66 and have had a fantastic life. If I go, I go. I'm in life to be positive and it's important to be positive for the people around you.\" Allied to Head-Maarek's resilience are some impressive genes which suggest she won't be shuffling off This Mortal Coil anytime soon -- her father, the esteemed former trainer Alec, celebrated his 90th birthday in August and is still going strong. The family has been an integral force in French flat racing since William Head, a former English jockey, relocated to France towards the end of the 19th century. Their association with the Prix de l'Arc Triomphe began with his son, another William, who trained Le Paillon to victory two years after the end of the World War Two and again triumphed in 1966 with Bon Mot. In turn, his son Alec was a four-time winning trainer (1952, 1959, 1976 and 1981) while grandson Freddy rode four winners -- the last of which was his sister Criquette's first success in 1979, Three Troikas -- a horse owned by their mother. For Head-Maarek -- christened Christiane but known from an early age as Criquette after her parents took to the name of one of their friends' daughters -- it was a remarkable start to her career as a trainer. It came barely a year after she had been awarded her horse-training license. Growing up, she rode on her pony to the stables each day with her father, telling him of her dream to follow in his footsteps. \"He just said, 'No, it wouldn't happen,' \" she recalls. \"You have to remember I was born in 1948 and there were no women trainers at all. That just did not exist. But from very young, that's all I wanted to be. I worked my whole life for that.\" Sent to boarding school in England to learn the language, she was miserable. Rather than study, she spent her time leafing through copies of Sporting Life to check the form and ensure she did not miss a trick in flat racing. A seven-year stint in Madrid from 1967 ensured she is trilingual, able to switch between the three languages as quickly as Treve's turn of pace on the gallops. But she missed France, with the lure of home and horses proving too much. Her first equine job at home was as a bloodstock agent before becoming her father's assistant and then applying for her license in 1978, a female trailblazer along with compatriot Myriam Bollack-Badel, who applied for a license at a similar age and still trains today. Head-Maarek's list of victories since have been impressive -- virtually every race imaginable on French soil, as well as a host of international ones, most notably in England with the 1,000 Guineas (four times), the Coronation Stakes and the Champion Stakes. But the standout wins are the two Prix de l'Arcs, 34 years apart. \"When I won in 1979, I didn't think when will I win it again?\" she says. \"I had horses that ran well some years but it was a case of if I win it, I win it. For me, it was no problem not to win it. It's a hard race, the race that everyone wants to win. \"It's the best race in Europe, actually for me it's the best race in the world. Okay, there's more money with the Dubai World Cup but this has got an aura that no other race possesses. It's something special and, between my family, we've been lucky to have won it a few times.\" Head-Maarek finds it impossible to pick her favorite Arc winner, akin to picking a favorite child. She bought Three Troikas in England on behalf of her mother, while Treve -- the filly now owned by Sheik Joann Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family -- was bred by her father. \"I have had a few bad years so to then have Treve...\" she says trailing off, almost silenced by the impression arguably the best filly she has ever seen has had on her. Frankie Dettori, Joann's jockey of choice, has been replaced by Thierry Jarnet, who rides Treve regularly and was on board for last year's success. It was a difficult discussion with Dettori, who she calls \"a very nice boy that understood by point of view,\" arguing the blow may have been softened by Treve's relatively lackluster displays of late. \"Treve will go to the Arc whatever,\" says Head-Maarek of the filly's race chances at Longchamp. \"She is not what she was last year because she's had problems with her foot and back. But she's fine, she's getting better. She is a fine champion whatever happens but how will she go? I don't know.\" Whether Treve can become the first horse since Alleged, originally ridden by brother Freddy and father Alec, in 1978 to pull off a successful defense is the $5 million question in a race with a purse to match that sum. Head-Maarek insists she is not driven to match the four Arc wins of her father -- \"it's difficult to do what he has done\" -- and she still leans on him for advice as she always done. She still follows his old-school methods of feeding the horses just oats, carrots and artichokes and not using supplements. He, though, was reluctant to let her train, she says because of a fear she might fail, and he protected her in those early years. \"Everyone thought he was just training the horses so, when I made mistakes and they didn't run well, everyone thought it was him,\" she says. \"Although with that he was also credited with the wins. But I didn't mind, I knew what I had done. \"For me, I don't see him so much anymore but I will always listen to him.\" Head-Maarek now has the full run of Le Quesnay, the Head base bought by her father and grandfather in 1958. It was a rundown property, left to ruin after the Nazis and their commander for Normandy -- who used it as their base -- were eventually driven out of France. Even today, some of the bunkers remain. \"We couldn't blow those up,\" she says matter-of-factly. Her grandfather was virtually speechless when he first viewed the property, thinking it would ruin the family. But the entire site was rebuilt and has become a horse-racing empire in the intervening five and a half decades. She was 10 when she arrived there, for her it has always been home, a lifetime surrounded by horses, and not once has she ever felt claustrophobic in the equine world. A suggestion that she might ever have been tempted to escape such a life leads to a baffled response. \"Escape?! No, I love it too much and there's still so much to achieve. I want to win the English Derby and every year is different,\" she says referring to Britain's most prestigious race. \"I'm not ready to stop.\"\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- With his frequent use of Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram, Barack Obama has often been called the most tech-savvy of U.S. presidents. So it makes sense that he was also the first president in 2009 to appoint a federal technology officer, a high-level adviser who helps guide government initiatives on tech, entrepreneurship and innovation. That appointee, Aneesh Chopra, stepped down in January. Now his successor, Todd Park, is continuing the effort. A Harvard graduate, health-tech entrepreneur and former chief tech officer for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Park took office in March and has only recently begun speaking publicly on his goals for his new job. We spoke to Park recently about Obama's high-tech agenda, the power of big data and how technology can help drive job growth. Here is an edited transcript of our conversation. CNN: Tell me a little bit about your position as you understand it. Park: My job is to be tech entrepreneur-in-residence at the White House. My role is to be an internal change agent that works with the best innovators inside and outside of government to conceive of, and then execute, at high speed, a portfolio of initiatives that unleash the power of data, tech and innovation to improve the well-being of the American people. And about 20% of my time is functioning a senior advisor on [these] issues. What kinds of things does the president ask your advice on? The president's team asks me to get involved in everything from, say, helping to move the health insurance exchange programs along to assisting on, say, initiatives to help streamline the student loan process. It actually tends to be issues that relate to how technology and data can be applied to advance the ball on key national priorities, like education, energy, health care, public safety, job creation. How would you describe the president's approach to technology? The president is a hugely enthusiastic proponent of the power of data, technology and innovation to advance national priorities. Probably the highest compliment I can pay him is that his geek quotient is very high. What, exactly, is the power of government data? It's the notion of government taking a public good, which is this data -- say weather data, or the global-positioning system or health-related knowledge and information -- making it available in electronic, computable form and having entrepreneurs and innovators of all stripes turn it into an unbelievable array of products and services that improves lives and create jobs. Government supplies the public good that is the data and [the] private sector supplies the creativity. What is it about the private sector that is more nimble and creative? I think the real secret is Joy's Law. This is a law that we're very fond of citing. It's named after Bill Joy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, a legendary figure in [Silicon] Valley, who once famously said, \"no matter who you are, most of the smartest people in the world work for somebody else.\" Which is always true, no matter who you are [laughs]. So, having worked, for example, in [Health and Human Services]. There are a lot of smart of people in HHS, a lot of smart people. There's just many, many, many, many ... more smart people outside HHS. And, so, I think the key there is that if you make data available to everybody else, just by sheer numbers and sheer diversity of who they are and where they are, they will, of course, create many more powerful services and products ... than any group of people in any one organization possibly could. We are enabling entrepreneurs and innovators across all walks of life to tap into fields of data sitting in the vaults of government in machine-readable form. They can, as they did with weather data, as they did with GPS data, create all kinds of services and products that we can only even barely imagine. Can you briefly describe your history in the private sector, why you got into government and how it's prepared you for your current role? When I was 24, I co-founded a company called Athenahealth which built the first Web-based software and back-office service suite for doctors' offices. Ten years later, we took it public. It ended its first day of trading with a market cap of over $1 billion. A year later, with the company doing incredibly well, and in order to stay married, I retired, joined the board, started a family with my wife and moved to California to be near her folks. I then co-founded another company, called Castlight Health, which provides health care shopping services to consumers, and helped start a third company called Healthpoint Services, which provides affordable telemedical services, clean water, drugs and diagnostics to rural villages in India. Then, in the summer of 2009, I got an e-mail ... asking to speak with me about the position of chief technology officer of HHS, a person who would serve as a \"tech entrepreneur-in-residence,\" an internal change agent dedicated to leading initiatives that would help HHS unleash the power of data and technology to improve the health of all Americans. They were very interested in bringing in someone with deep private sector entrepreneurial experience, as they felt that this person would be ideally suited to the role. At first, the prospect of losing me again to 24-7 workaholic mode was not a big hit at home. But after thinking about it for a few days, my wife said that if HHS was really looking for a tech entrepreneur-in-residence, then it was my national duty to do that job, and that we should go serve. So we did. Here's what I'll say about my experience in government thus far: It has been the most entrepreneurial experience of my life. How do you hope the federal government will change its approach to technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship? We believe [our agenda] will significantly increase return on taxpayer investment in government. The agenda has three key components: . One, go mobile, enabling more and more government services to be accessed on mobile devices, bringing government literally to your fingertips. Two, buy smarter, revamping how government buys technology to get a bigger bang for taxpayers' buck. Three, open up our data, enabling it to be used as a national resource by entrepreneurs and innovators to create new products and jobs. To help advance this agenda, we've launched a new Presidential Innovation Fellows program. This program will pair amazing innovators from outside government with amazing innovators inside government on five game-changing projects that aim to deliver significant initial results within six months. These projects in sum aim to save taxpayer dollars, contribute to economic growth and job creation and improve the lives of Americans in multiple ways. And they aim to do so through the work of small, entrepreneurial teams working inside the government, teams of citizen innovators and government innovators who are working together to get amazing things done for the American people. What's the best way for the American people to get involved? The president is catalyzing a remarkable change in government. Government is truly beginning to embrace the power of innovation for the people and by the people, the idea that if government collaborates openly with and unleashes the ingenuity of the public, it will get much more done, much faster and at much lower cost than if government acted alone. The Open Data Initiatives program exemplifies this approach. The government could have decided to keep all of its data in-house and be the sole builder of tools that utilize government data to help citizens. Instead, we're working to open up our data so that entrepreneurs and innovators across the country can build many more tools and create much more benefit with our data than government could possibly deliver alone. The five Presidential Innovation Fellows projects, which include the Open Data Initiatives program, embody this idea of innovation for the people and by the people. We're asking for amazing citizen innovators to come to D.C. and serve their country for a short-term tour of duty starting in July. Folks who can't tear themselves away to be Fellows can sign up to follow one or more of the five projects and participate in them in other ways. For example, you might be an entrepreneur who is interested in making a difference in the world of education. You can sign up to follow the Open Data Initiatives program, learn more about the education data we're making available, give us feedback about the data and use it as fuel to build something amazing that will help a family make the best possible decision about where to send their daughter to college and create jobs in your community at the same time. The thing I love about this emerging philosophy of government, this idea of a government that embraces the power of innovation for and by the people, is that at its core is the belief that government and the people are one. We as citizens are the true owners of government. Any of us, if we choose, should be able to stand up, serve our country and make a difference. If we can continue to move government more and more in that direction, that will be a wonderful legacy to leave our children.\n\n**News 4**:\n(CNN) -- Sadly there is nothing new about the atrocities being inflicted against civilians in the Central African Republic. What is new is the scale of the violence and widespread and arbitrary targeting of people solely because of their religion. Christian militia loyal to former President Francois Bozize began an offensive last week against the capital, Bangui. The militia attacked mosques, daubing walls with the slogan \"Tuer les musulmans\" (Kill the Muslims) in what Amnesty International describes as \"a shocking escalation of anti-Muslim rhetoric within the Christian community.\" In turn, largely Muslim militia known as the Seleka have killed Christians in their homes and attacked hospitals and churches. Tens of thousands of Christians have taken refuge in churches and Roman Catholic missions around the country. Some are taking shelter in hangars at the Bangui airport. One missionary in Bangui told a Roman Catholic charity: \"We have never seen anything as bad as this before. We're at the mercy of God, please pray for us.\" French troops are trying to disarm rival groups of vigilantes before a Rwanda-style genocide can take hold. But the Central African Republic is the size of France, and there are fewer than 2,000 of these troops currently deployed -- along with some 2,500 African peacekeepers. The French intervention has reduced the violence in Bangui, but the long-term danger is that sectarian brutality will perpetuate communal hatred. Some analysts and U.N. officials also fear the situation may fuel a regional confrontation between Christians and Muslims -- one that has already devastated northern Nigeria and is percolating in neighboring Cameroon. According to a senior U.N. official, the militant Islamist group Boko Haram -- which has instigated much of the anti-Christian violence in Nigeria -- already has a presence in the Central African Republic, where the lack of government authority, porous borders and a ready supply of weapons provide the perfect incubator for such groups. In most provinces, there is no police or judicial system. The rise of the Seleka militia . Muslims make up 15% of the country's population and live mainly in the sparsely populated northeast. The Seleka, the loose alliance of Muslim militia, emerged a year ago in response to the neglect of the region as well as human rights abuses -- including rampant torture of prisoners -- by Bozize's government. The Seleka began advancing south this year, burning and looting as it went and seizing Bangui in March. One leader, Michel Djotodia, proclaimed himself president, the first head of state from the marginalized northeast. The Seleka was later officially disbanded, but as many as 15,000 kept their arms and instead continued to wreak havoc in Bangui and elsewhere. They mainly targeted Christian communities, which in turn mobilized self-defense units known as anti-Balaka (literally \"anti-machete.\") In September, Human Rights Watch reported that \"with no checks on (its) power, the Seleka rule (operated) arbitrarily and with complete impunity, with the government failing to follow through on its public commitment to bring to justice those responsible for recent abuses.\" Rape, summary executions, the theft of food and burning of homes were common. The rights group said some of the Seleka fighters were as young as 13. A report by a U.N. mission to the Security Council in October estimated 3,500 children were among the ex-Seleka fighters and found \"an alarming increase in inter-communal violence ... (which) threatens to degenerate into a country-wide religious and ethnic divide.\" Complicating the picture, many of the Seleka are from outside the Central African Republic -- from neighboring Chad and Sudan. Some of the Sudanese were allegedly members of the militant Muslim Janjaweed militia, which killed thousands during the conflict in Darfur in western Sudan. Victims of Seleka attacks told Human Rights Watch that their assailants often spoke Arabic. Others in the Seleka had no ideology or political agenda: They just wanted power and wealth. The Central African Republic's northeast is rich in diamonds. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country has long suffered from the attention of outsiders wanting a slice of its natural resources: diamonds, gold, timber and ivory among them. It has borders with six countries and in its 53 years as an independent state has rarely seen political stability or economic growth. A bewildering array of rebel factions, based on ethnic and tribal affiliation or simply to serve a warlord's ambitions, has risen and fallen. Sectarian killing may overlap with other problems . Some analysts believe the fighting in the Central African Republic is not about Islam and Christianity, which have become labels under which people have taken shelter as the state has collapsed. Few of the Seleka -- or of the country's Muslim minority -- would likely subscribe to Boko Haram's virulently anti-Western message. Louisa Lombard, an anthropologist who has been visiting the Central African Republic for the last decade, said the sectarian killing overlaps with other grievances. \"Intercommunal relations have deteriorated for a lot of reasons: economic decline, for one,\" Lombard told CNN. \"The speed with which alliances are made and broken in CAR shows that this is largely a question of resources.\" There is also the perception that \"foreigners\" control the country's wealth, and a complete lack of trust among communities, Lombard said. \"This is not a case of religious extremism. This is a case of religion being bound up in other dividing lines in the society,\" she added. But the current carnage, the physical separation and mutual fear of Christians and Muslims, provide a fertile recruiting ground for extremists. The U.N. report warned the dynamic of religious violence may spill beyond the Central African Republic and be exploited by groups from outside the country. It said tensions between Muslims and Christians \"might well lead to uncontrollable sectarian violence with untold consequences for the country, the subregion and beyond.\" That can work both ways. Edmond Mulet, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping, told the Voice of America this week there are indications Boko Haram has some kind of presence in the country. Lombard said radical Islam may be growing from a narrow base but said she sees no evidence of Boko Haram there. Recruiting ground for extremists . Militant Islamist groups do have a growing presence elsewhere in West Africa, from Mauritania in the north to Cameroon in the south. Moderate Muslim leaders in Cameroon allege that Boko Haram has begun recruiting there. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, Cameroon President Paul Biya told the U.S. ambassador in 2010 that he \"was concerned about the threat of Islamic extremism (and) beginning to worry about Islamic extremists infiltrating Cameroon from Nigeria and making inroads through Cameroonian mosques.\" Last week, Boko Haram demonstrated its resilience in the face of a crackdown by Nigerian security forces with a mass attack on an air force base in the northern city of Maiduguri. Nigerian sources said several hundred men were involved and had arrived in a convoy of trucks. One captured fighter, paraded at a news conference, claimed that Boko Haram now had men from Niger, Chad and Cameroon in its ranks. Boko Haram has already shown it can operate beyond Nigeria, kidnapping a French priest in northern Cameroon last month. Intelligence sources told CNN this year that Boko Haram had trained with jihadist groups in remote areas of northern Mali before the French military intervention there, an assertion French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius recently repeated. But in the immediate future, the people of the Central African Republic face far greater challenges than the infiltration by militant groups. UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Mia Farrow, who has visited the country several times, said six years ago she felt its citizens were \"the most abandoned people on earth.\" Their situation has worsened since then. Even before the latest implosion, some two-thirds of its people lived below the poverty line. Average adult life expectancy is 48 years, the second lowest in the world. In the past year, more than half a million have been displaced; one in four of the population has inadequate access to food. The United Nations said in the past week alone more than 70,000 people in Bangui fled their homes. Many have vanished into the bush beyond the reach of aid agencies. Even if the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations can raise funds needed to deal with the humanitarian crisis, Lombard and others said the Central African Republic faces a long, hard road to anything resembling stability. \"In the middle and longer term, a real political project will be needed -- something that makes the country's politics more inclusive and establishes a kind of social contract,\" Lombard said. \"Unfortunately, that is not something that international organizations are very well placed to help with.\" She added, \"We'll really be starting from scratch, but we won't be starting with a clean slate. The long history of violent politics is inscribed in this place.\""}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7511, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\nWashington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday rejected a GOP call to resign, telling a heated Senate hearing that Republicans were trying to score political points instead of addressing significant issues. Under attack from the outset by Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder rejected accusations he was stonewalling congressional investigators on the botched \"Fast and Furious\" gunrunning sting operation and failing to investigate recent leaks of classified information properly. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, leveled the harshest criticism, accusing Holder of misleading Congress over what he and other top Justice Department officials knew about the Fast and Furious program and refusing to appoint a special counsel to investigate leaked national security details in recent media reports. Holder rested his head on one hand as Cornyn recited a litany of allegations involving the attorney general's performance. \"I'm afraid we've come to an impasse,\" Cornyn said, adding that Holder \"violated the public trust\" in his view. \"With regret, you've left me with no choice but to join those who call for you to resign your office.\" Holder responded by calling Cornyn's list of allegations \"almost breathtaking in its inaccuracy\" and said: \"I don't have any intention of resigning.\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that President Barack Obama maintains \"absolute confidence\" in the attorney general, which Holder noted Tuesday. Regarding congressional demands for Fast and Furious documents, including a House committee that plans to take up a contempt measure against Holder next week, the attorney general said good-faith efforts to work with the House panel have failed to reach a deal. \"The desire here is not for accommodation but for political point-making,\" Holder said, calling such behavior \"the thing that turns people off about Washington.\" In what appeared to be a coordinated move, Republicans, led by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, introduced a resolution Tuesday supporting the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the classified leaks. McCain: Obama responsible for leaks . At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Republican senators said Holder's decision to appoint two U.S. attorneys to investigate, rather than a special counsel, failed to address the seriousness of the violations and represented a Democratic double standard. The issue sparked angry exchanges between senators, with Chairman Pat Leahy of Vermont and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, both Democrats, taking issue with arguments by Cornyn and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, that Holder was acting improperly. In response to Democratic support for Holder on the classified leaks investigation, Graham shot back: \"If the shoe was on the other foot, you and everyone else on the other side would be crying to high heaven to appoint a special prosecutor that all of us could buy into.\" Graham noted that as senators, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had called for the appointment of a special counsel in past situations that involved Republican transgressions, such as White House leaks in the Valerie Plame case that revealed the identity of the CIA operative. Senate breaks filibuster of Obama court pick . The current leaks were more serious, Graham argued, and Holder should do now what Obama and Biden had called for then. However, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and is a member of the judiciary panel, repeated her past contention that a special counsel's investigation would take too long to deal with the immediate threat from classified leaks. She said she would oppose the McCain resolution, adding that Holder took the right step in naming two U.S. attorneys to investigate in addition to the FBI probe already under way. Holder told the committee that both he and FBI Director Robert Mueller had been interviewed \"because we were people who had knowledge of these matters, and we wanted to make sure that with regard to the investigation, that it began with us.\" Describing his experience as \"a serious interview that was done by some serious FBI agents,\" Holder said he believed about 100 interviews had been conducted so far. Holder earlier offered to negotiate with congressional leaders on turning over documents involving Fast and Furious to avoid what he said could become a constitutional crisis. He later modified his characterization of the problem to a possible constitutional conflict. \"I am prepared to make compromises with regard to the documents to be made available,\" Holder said. At the same time, Holder said congressional Republicans must be open to working out an agreement. \"I've got to have a willing partner,\" Holder said. \"I've extended my hand, and I'm waiting to hear back.\" The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will consider the contempt measure against Holder on June 20, a panel statement said Monday. A vote by the panel could occur that day, and the measure would then require approval from the full chamber. Monday's announcement escalated a high-stakes, election-year face-off over what Republicans said is Holder's failure to respond to a subpoena for Justice Department documents on the botched operation. Could Congress go from bad to worse? The department has acknowledged the program, which allowed illegally purchased guns to \"walk\" across the border into Mexico, was badly flawed. Such sting operations have now been prohibited. The department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which lost track of more than 1,000 firearms after they crossed the border, found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010. Terry's family has been among critics of the Justice Department's handling of the case. On Tuesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, raised the matter in his opening statement and again in direct questioning of Holder, noting that questions remain almost a year after three whistle-blowers testified before the House Oversight and Goverment Reform Committee about gunrunning. \"Here we are, one year later, and the Terry family is still waiting for answers. They're still waiting for justice,\" Grassley said, noting assertions by House Republicans that sealed requests for wiretaps under the Fast and Furious program showed top Justice Department officials knew about the questionable operation long before so far acknowledged. Holder repeated what he told a House committee last week -- that he read the affidavits and summaries and found no incriminating information. \"You reach conclusions on the basis of hindsight,\" Holder said. \"I try to put myself in the place of people actually looking at the material at the time.\" Holder has testified at eight congressional hearings on Operation Fast and Furious, and he has consistently maintained that he knew nothing about the flawed tactics until early last year. The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said Monday that the panel wants documents that explain why Holder and the Justice Department decided months later to retract a February 4, 2011, letter to Congress that denied any knowledge by senior officials of improper tactics in the gunrunning sting. The Justice Department slammed the House committee's Monday announcement, calling it \"unfortunate and unwarranted.\" \"From the beginning, Chairman Issa has distorted the facts, ignored testimony and flung inaccurate accusations at the attorney general and others, and this latest move fits within that tired political playbook that has so many Americans disillusioned with Washington,\" said spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. Both Issa and the Justice Department statement said a resolution still could be reached to avoid the contempt measure. Last week, Holder assigned Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a Democratic appointee, and Rod J. Rosenstein, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland and a holdover GOP appointee, to lead the investigations into the alleged leaks. McCain and other Republicans are insisting on a special counsel, contending that investigators within the system would face a conflict of interest in pursuing top government officials. A recent report in The New York Times provided classified details of what it described as a U.S cyberattack targeting Iran's nuclear centrifuge program sparked the bipartisan outrage. Other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and Obama's involvement in \"kill lists\" against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. The public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula also angered intelligence and national security officials. Republicans noted that some articles cited sources who took part in White House meetings, which they said showed that leaks were coming from administration officials. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, repeatedly asked Holder how two U.S. attorneys could effectively investigate top national security issues involved in White House meetings cited. Holder insisted the attorneys he named were dogged prosecutors who would follow any lead, no matter where it took them. Obama has strongly rejected claims that his White House has deliberately leaked secrets to the media, saying the idea was \"offensive\" and would put Americans at risk. Graham, however, said Tuesday that the pattern of the administration was to be uncooperative on issues that might embarrass it -- such as Fast and Furious and now the classified leaks. Holder responded the administration has prosecuted classified leaks more than any previous administration. CNN's Ted Barrett and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\nWashington (CNN) -- Despite mounting pressure from some lawmakers and dissent within the ranks of his top advisers, President Barack Obama decided not to release photos of Osama bin Laden's dead body, a White House spokesman said Wednesday. \"It is not in our national security interest ... to allow these images to become icons to rally opinion against the United States,\" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. \"We have no need to publish those photographs to establish that Osama bin Laden was killed,\" he said. Shortly after U.S. officials announced the decision, a news agency published photographs it said were taken by a Pakistani security official shortly after the raid. The images, published by Reuters Wednesday, showed three men lying in pools of blood and the wreckage of a U.S. helicopter abandoned during the assault. None of the pictures appeared to show bin Laden's dead body. White House officials remained firm in their assertion that releasing graphic photos of bin Laden could incite more violence. To further explain the controversial choice, Carney read Obama's remarks from the transcript of a Wednesday afternoon interview. \"That's not who we are. We don't trot out this stuff as trophies. The fact of the matter is that this is someone who is deserving of the justice he received. ... We don't need to spike the football,\" Obama told CBS News. Obama's decision settles the debate over whether the United States will release the images. But opinions about whether the U.S. government's photographs should be public were anything but unanimous among U.S. lawmakers and members of the public at home and abroad. Some argued releasing the images would put to rest any critics or conspiracy theories, while others countered that the graphic photos would only inflame jihadists. A senior Democratic official close to the White House told CNN that the president was \"never in favor\" of releasing the photos, even as CIA chief Leon Panetta made it sound like their release was imminent. Carney said Obama consulted Cabinet and security officials before he made his choice Wednesday morning, and a majority of them weighed in against releasing the photographs. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were among those who supported Obama's inclination to keep the pictures classified, the senior Democratic official said. But Panetta said Tuesday he thought a photograph of bin Laden's body would be released at some point. \"I just think it's important -- they know we have it -- to release it,\" the CIA director said. The president's inner circle was not happy with those remarks, the senior Democratic official said. But a senior Obama administration official said debates over the pros and cons of releasing the photos were \"not at all contentious.\" The official admitted that \"leaks are possible,\" but said that did not sway the president from reaching his decision. Carney stressed that Obama wanted to hear differing perspectives to inform his choice. \"He wanted to hear the opinions of others, but he was very clear about his view on this,\" Carney said. \"There are obviously arguments to be made on either side.\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the decision a \"mistake.\" \"I know bin Laden is dead. But the best way to protect and defend our interests overseas is to prove that fact to the rest of the world,\" he said in a written statement. \"I'm afraid the decision made today by President Obama will unnecessarily prolong this debate.\" Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, also said Obama made the wrong choice about the photos. \"I want to see them, personally,\" he said. \"I did three tours. I'm not talking as a member of the Armed Services Committee -- (but) as a Marine who did three tours because of 9/11. As Americans we deserve to see them.\" But House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said he shares the president's view. \"In my opinion, there's no end served by releasing a picture of someone who has been killed, and I think there is absolute proof that Osama bin Laden was in fact the person ... killed,\" he said. Lawmakers involved in national security began debating the issue well before Obama's decision. The top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee has argued they should be made public right away. \"I think the question is, what's the negative that could come from it?\" asked Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia. \"One of these days they're going to be released; it's a question of whether it be now on our terms or (let) somebody else do it.\" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, who chairs the Armed Services Committee -- and who has not seen the photos -- had argued that the United States should wait to allow the emotions of people around the world who may be sympathetic to bin Laden to cool down. \"I'd let a little time pass so we that we don't play into the hands of people who want to retaliate with what obviously will be a sensational picture. I would not want to feed that sensation, so I'd wait days or weeks,\" he said. Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson suggested temporarily keeping the photos confidential, but releasing them eventually. In a letter sent to the White House Wednesday, he proposed establishing a review process \"to release all relevant photographs as early as 10 years from now,\" or when the president \"determines their release would no longer endanger the lives of Americans.\" While some Republican leaders criticized Obama, the debate over the photographs did not entirely split along party lines. Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said he was against releasing any photos, saying that he didn't want to make the job of U.S. troops abroad \"any harder than it already is.\" \"Imagine how the American people would react if al Qaeda killed one of our troops or military leaders, and put photos of the body on the Internet. Osama bin Laden is not a trophy -- he is dead and let's now focus on continuing the fight until al Qaeda has been eliminated,\" he said. House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King, a Republican from New York who has argued that the photographs should not be classified, said he understood Obama's call. \"While I have said that a photo release may be a good way to combat the predictable conspiracy theories about bin Laden's death, this is a decision for the President to make, and I respect his decision,\" he said in a statement. Obama's choice comes as a poll shows that a majority of Americans support making the photographs public. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday, 56% of those asked said yes, the government should release a photo of bin Laden's body. Another 39% said no. The poll of 700 adults had a sampling margin of 3.5%. The government has said it matched DNA to confirm that the body was bin Laden's, and most have accepted that news as evidence of the outcome of the operation. Some groups, however -- including the Taliban -- have questioned the assertion. \"Obama has not got any strong evidence that can prove his claim over killing of the Sheikh Osama bin Laden,\" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed said. \"And secondly, the closest sources for Sheikh Osama bin Laden have not confirmed\" the death. And at a university in the affluent Pakistani town where U.S. officials say troops killed bin Laden, a group of students clamored to tell CNN why they doubted the al Qaeda leader had been killed in the raid. \"If it is true, then why they are not showing his body?\" one asked. Similar doubt and demands for evidence that bin Laden is dead echoed on the streets of Islamabad. \"I believe this is all fake,\" one man said. \"Wherever he is, he's alive.\" But the White House has dismissed such criticisms. \"There are going to be some folks who deny it. The fact of the matter is, you will not see bin Laden walking on this Earth again,\" Obama told CBS. None of the photos published by Reuters appeared to show bin Laden. One photo shows a man, clad in a T-shirt, lying in a large pool of blood that appears to spread from the back of his head. Two other men pictured appear to have died from extensive head and chest wounds. The White House has received three sets of photographs, according to a senior U.S. official. One batch, which clearly shows bin Laden's body, was taken at a hangar in Afghanistan, the official said. The official described one of the images as a clear, but gruesome, picture of the al Qaeda leader's face. Bin Laden is shown with a massive open head wound across both eyes, the official said, adding that the image would not be appropriate for the front pages of newspapers. The other photos include the raid on the compound and bin Laden's burial at sea, according to the official. CNN's Ed Henry, John King, Jessica Yellin, Ted Barrett, Ed Hornick, Dana Bash, Dan Lothian, Susan Candiotti, Nick Paton Walsh and Leone Lakhani contributed to this report.\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- Camille Olivia Hanks was studying at the University of Maryland when she met Bill Cosby in the early '60s. He was doing stand-up comedy in Washington when the two were set up on a blind date. They fell in love and she left school to support his burgeoning career in entertainment. By 1964, the two were married and they would go on to have five children together. In 1997, their son Ennis (who inspired the character Theo Huxtable) was murdered, and a few years later Dr. Camille Cosby did a one-on-one with Oprah explaining how she'd eventually been able to find joy after mourning the loss of a child. Throughout that interview it was so clear that you were looking at the real-life Clair Huxtable that even Oprah seemed a bit star-struck by her poise and grace. During her 2000 appearance on Oprah, Camille revealed: . \"I became keenly aware of myself in my mid-thirties. I went through a transition. I decided to go back to school, because I had dropped out of college to marry Bill when I was 19. I had five children, and I decided to go back. I didn't feel fulfilled educationally. I dropped out of school at the end of my sophomore year. So I went back, and when I did, my self-esteem grew. I got my master's, then decided to get my doctoral degree. Education helped me to come out of myself.\" When asked why she wasn't content to just settle for being the wife of a famous entertainer she continued: . \"I don't know exactly what it was, except that for me, integrity is important. For me friendships are important, family is important, and it is a blessing if we can have monetary benefits. That's wonderful, and I love it. But I have to have the security of people who really care about me, and me about them. I want to be surrounded by people who have integrity. And, of course, my name is Camille, not Bill.\" That was a beautiful answer. But a lot has changed since then. These days, Camille Cosby is standing alongside her husband during what may turn out to be the worst month of his long career. For the last few weeks, the beloved TV dad who used to sell us Jell-O pudding pops has been at the center of an ever-growing scandal. He has canceled several appearances, Netflix has postponed the launch of his stand-up special, NBC nixed plans for a new comedy show, and this week Janice Dickinson became the latest woman to make allegations against him; telling E News that he raped her in 1982 after she'd done a stint in rehab. Cosby is arguably the most successful African-American performer in television history, but this isn't the first time he has found himself under scrutiny for extramarital affairs. In his biography, \"Cosby: His Life and Times,\" Mark Whitaker makes mention of the legendary comedian's \"roving eye\" and even tells an anecdote about how he finally cut back on his womanizing by breaking up with his long-time girlfriend. Now it seems those softball admissions about having a weakness for beautiful women may have been shrouding something much more sinister than an affair. From thegrio.com: Dear Bill Cosby, heed your own advice and be accountable . In the last decade alone, more than a dozen women have accused Cosby of rape or sexual assault. No formal charges have ever been successfully filed, so even with all the media speculation, these claims are technically only allegations. But there is one person in this melee whose anguish is virtually indisputable: his wife, Camille. So how does a woman like that end up spending 50 years of her life beside a man who is now alleged to be a serial rapist? One can only imagine the embarrassment she must be experiencing through all this. But her dilemma is a lot more common than you may think. In a world that asks you to be a mother, a wife, a businesswoman and an alluring sexual being, women grapple with finding the balance between respecting themselves and prioritizing their relationships. While many say they would leave a spouse who cheats, experts estimate that approximately 50-75% of couples rocked by an affair stay together. There are many reasons why some women choose to stay: the fear of being alone, financial dependency, belief that they can alter the behavior of their mate, professional status of their partner, deep emotional investment and family obligations. It is hard enough to come back from infidelity in private, let alone when you have the added stress of being a public figure. Both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Edwards have weathered similar storms with men they devoted their lives to. And one could argue that it is a lose/lose situation for any wife who finds herself in that position: If you stay, people judge you for not standing up for yourself, and if you leave there is endless speculation about why your marriage failed. But this isn't just a simple case of being cheated on. There are some very serious stories coming to the forefront from those who describe Cosby as a sexual predator, who for decades allegedly drugged and violated young women who looked up to him as a mentor. During one of Cosby's old routines, he actually jokes about drugging young women. Coincidentally the set is from his album \"It's True! It's True!\" which was released in 1969, the same year Joan Tarshis claims he drugged and raped her. We can only speculate on what Camille's reasons are for staying in her marriage, when she found out about each rape claim, or whether she believes in her husband's innocence. She's been stoic and tight-lipped through all this, exuding the unflappable composure that she is known for. During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, many believed that had Hillary Clinton left her husband, his political career would have collapsed. Hillary Clinton may have well understood that her marriage wasn't just a union between a man and a woman but a much larger political machine. Perhaps Camille Cosby, who is equally responsible for her husband's career, feels a similar responsibility to maintaining the legacy and philanthropic institution she and her husband have built together. Few knew that in the original \"Cosby Show\" pitch, Bill had planned to have Heathcliff be a limousine driver who was married to a Latina handywoman. Programming executives weren't too thrilled with that idea, but it was Camille who convinced her husband to go in another direction. According to another excerpt in Whitaker's book: . \"The producers felt strongly that both [parents on the show] should be college graduates. As Cosby had proved in his stand-up act, the war of wits between parents and children was even funnier if the parents thought of themselves as highly intelligent people. \"Finally, shortly before 1 in the morning, Cosby said the words that made Carsey think that she might be getting someplace: 'I think my wife would agree with you.' \" 'You will not be a chauffeur!' Camille said when he briefed her on the meeting. 'Why not?' Cosby asked. 'Because I'm not going to be a carpenter!' Camille said.\" That snippet gives a rare glimpse into the type of bond these two have, and also illustrates that Mrs. Cosby has not just been her husband's muse, but also a trusted adviser who keeps his career on track, behind the scenes. Sunday when NPR host Scott Simon asked Cosby about the resurfaced rape charges, he was met with a wall of silence. Later on, Simon admitted to CNN that during that awkward moment in the interview, the one thing he couldn't do was look at Camille. \"I did not look at Mrs. Cosby, and I don't mind saying I might've been a little uncomfortable doing that anyway,\" Simon said. That's what many find so unsettling about all this: the deafening silence of it all. The same man who has spent years waxing poetic about every social issue under the sun has now fallen completely mute on us, with his equally reticent wife by his side. The Cosbys' union remains seemingly stable through half a century of life's ups and downs, and as someone who respects the institution of marriage I find that commendable. But when does the adage of \"stand by your man\" go too far? I'm rooting for black love as much as the next person -- but not like this. From thegrio.com: Dr. Huxtable no more, Cosby lost that persona after 13 rape allegations .

Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March 2009 in New York and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. Al Qaeda recruits say they received training in how to handle rockets, explosives and bombs. (CNN) -- The interrogations of two accused Westerners who say they trained and fought with al Qaeda in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region provide an inside view of the terror group's organizational structures. Arguably, they shed more light on the state of al Qaeda than any material previously released into the public domain. The documents reveal training programs and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective U.S. missile strikes. Bryant Vinas -- a U.S. citizen who says he traveled to Pakistan in September 2007 to fight against Americans in Afghanistan -- stated that between March and July 2008 he attended three al Qaeda training courses, which focused on weapons, explosives, and rocket-based or -propelled weaponry. During these classes, attended by 10-20 recruits, Vinas was taught how to handle a large variety of weapons and explosives, some of them of military grade sophistication, according to his account. Read how al Qaeda is now operating . Vinas stated he became familiar with seeing, smelling and touching different explosives such as TNT, as well as plastic explosives such as RDX, Semtex, C3 and C4 -- the explosive U.S. authorities have stated was used in al Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in 2000. Vinas also learned how to make vests for suicide bombers. Vinas stated he was also instructed how to prepare and place fuses, how to test batteries, how to use voltmeters and how to build circuitry for a bomb. Read how Vinas met with al Qaeda leaders . According to his account, al Qaeda also offered a wide variety of other courses including electronics, sniper, and poisons training. Instruction in the actual construction of bombs, he stated, was offered to al Qaeda recruits who had become more advanced in their training. Vinas' training during this period was very similar to the training described by members of a French-Belgian group who also spent time in the tribal areas of Pakistan in 2008. Walid Othmani, a French recruit, stated the group were given explosives training and taught how to fire rocket launchers and RPGs. Othmani provided French interrogators with an account of his time in Pakistan after being arrested on his return to Europe. Three other members of his group are now in Belgian custody awaiting trial for \"participation in a terrorist group.\" Belgian prosecutors told CNN Othmani has been charged in France with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act. A Belgian legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by CNN. Like Vinas, Othmani said the group had been required to sign forms before their training. Othmani stated his group was required to pledge absolute obedience to their handlers and indicate whether they wanted to become suicide bombers. Othmani provided interesting new details about the training facilities being used by al Qaeda in the tribal areas. His group trained in a small mountain shack, a far cry from the large camps al Qaeda had run in Taliban-era Afghanistan, when it had been able to operate with little danger of being targeted by military strikes. Othmani's account made clear that al Qaeda has had to decentralize its operations in Pakistan in response to the growing effectiveness of U.S. Predator strikes. However the wide number of training courses described by both Vinas and Othmani suggest that al Qaeda has been able to adapt well to the new security environment. By operating a larger number of smaller facilities, al Qaeda would also appear to have increased its resilience to attack. Read how al Qaeda is looking for Western targets . While the classrooms are safer from drone attacks than the pre-9/11 sessions on the mountainsides the content seems to have changed to match new targeting plans. Suicide vest and IED construction show how the curriculum is being modified for today's combat with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Making and handling explosives, as well as fuse construction, show the sessions may also be geared for killing in Europe and the United States. These are the very skills the July 7, 2005 London bombers Shehzad Tanweer and Mohammed Siddique Khan came to Pakistan to learn. Al Qaeda, it would seem, may still want to pull off the spectacular attack in Europe or the United States. Vinas says he took a course in propelled weaponry with Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, a former taxi driver in Brussels, Belgium, whom he first met in March 2008 and formed a friendship with. Vinas stated that when they completed their training, Al Qaeda instructors did a written evaluation of their performance. Vinas had been judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against U.S. and NATO bases in Afghanistan, according to his account. That suggests al Qaeda has maintained its capacity for administration and paperwork even in a harsher security environment. When their training finished in the summer of 2008, Vinas and Zrioul lived in the same house in the mountains of Waziristan. Zrioul managed to acquire a computer which he rigged up to watch jihadist videos. During a mountain walk with Zrioul one day, Vinas says he was told about a new course being taught by al Qaeda called \"international operations\" set up by al Qaeda's head of international operations whom Vinas later identified as Abu Hafith. Hafith, he stated, was responsible for recruitment and direction of terrorist cells, and attacks outside Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hafith was identified by his initials in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. He is believed to be still at large in the Pakistan-Afghan border area. Vinas was told that the training course that Hafith set up focused on kidnapping and assassination, including instruction on the use of silencers and how to break into and enter a property. The revelations raise the possibility that al Qaeda was developing a program of targeted assassinations. Though al Qaeda has carried out some assassinations in the past, most of its attacks in the West have not targeted any particular individuals but crowded areas, such as mass transport. According to Othmani, al Qaeda fighters totaled between 300-500 in Pakistan's Tribal Areas -- spread out in groups of 10. Such decentralization was a function of the growing deadliness of U.S. Predator strikes. Hicham Beyayo, a Belgian jihadist volunteer, said the group moved around a lot because such strikes were known to be \"very effective,\" his lawyer Christophe Marchand, told CNN. The loss of an increasing number of operatives, stated Othmani, prompted an order from al Qaeda's top command for fighters to remain inside as much as possible. In order to keep in touch, jihadists operated a courier service across the region, according to the Frenchman's testimony. The decentralization of al Qaeda's structures appears to have created some costs for recruits. Two members of the Belgian-French group now in custody describe feeling increasingly cut off, bored, and fed up with the primitive living conditions in their mountain shacks, according to documents obtained by CNN and the defense lawyer of one of those charged. They often did not seem to know what their next orders would be or where their handlers would take them. They also described being deeply frustrated at being repeatedly given false promises that they would be able to fight in Afghanistan. Othmani also described the group's frustration at having to pay for their own weapons and training -- at a cost of 1,300 euros each (about $1,800) -- which if true might lend credence to reports that al Qaeda has come under financial strain. Vinas, for his part, made no mention of having to make payments to his handlers. Vinas and Othmani's accounts also suggest that al Qaeda may be having leadership problems. While able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested, the group seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures. A former U.S. government official, specializing in counter-terrorism, commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago. The only difference, there are fewer of them."}

The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators, and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. Vinas is believed to have lived in this Patchogue, New York, house with his father until 2007. (CNN) -- On September 10, 2007, almost exactly six years after al Qaeda attacked the United States, Bryant Neal Vinas, a 24-year-old American citizen born in Queens, New York, boarded a flight from the city en route to Lahore, in eastern Pakistan, determined to fight jihad in neighboring Afghanistan. Brought up a Catholic by his Latin American immigrant parents, who divorced when he was young, Vinas tried to join the U.S. Army in 2002 but dropped out after just a few weeks. In 2004 -- for reasons which are still unclear -- he converted to Islam and started frequenting a mosque in Long Island near where he lived with his father. During the next three years he became radicalized, U.S. officials have stated, in no small part because of his exposure to pro-al Qaeda Web sites. It is possible that Vinas was also influenced by people he came across in the New York area. A former U.S. government official told CNN that youths influenced by the ideas of the British pro-al Qaeda extremist group Al Muhajiroun were known to have hung out in the vicinity of the mosque at the same time as Vinas. Read how al Qaeda is changing . The former official told CNN that they were a splinter group of the Al Muhajiroun followers who used to hang out in the New York-Long Island area in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Al Muhajiroun's American members, the former official stated, included Syed Hashmi, a Brooklyn college graduate who traveled to Pakistan in 2003 and now awaits trial on charges of providing material support to the terrorist network. He has pleaded not guilty. Another who belonged to Al Muhajiroun was Mohammed Junaid Babar, a trainee Queens taxi driver, who met two of the July 7, 2005, London bombers in Pakistan and who in 2004 pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorists in Pakistan. Al Muhajiroun was formally disbanded in October 2004 but still operates, CNN has discovered, under a variety of guises. Anjem Choudhary, the former deputy leader of Al Muhajiroun, told CNN Monday that New York was one of the organization's main hubs before 2004. He says dozens of followers from the New York area still regularly tune into online sermons put together by the group's founder Omar Bakri Mohammed in Tripoli, Lebanon, where he has been living since being banned from the UK after the 2005 London bombings. Choudhary stated that he and Bakri were still loosely affiliated with The Islamic Thinkers Society, a New York based organization, which says the peaceful restoration of the Islamic Caliphate is one of its objectives. A March 5, 2009, posting on the homepage of its Web site states that Bakri Mohammed is \"a man who has inspired thousands across the world to rise for Islam.\" The Islamic Thinkers Society exists legally in the United States and says it is committed solely to the political and intellectual struggle for Islam. When Vinas arrived in Lahore he had little idea about how he was going to gain access to the fighting in Afghanistan, according to his own account. But a few days after he arrived he sought help from a New York friend, whom he knew moved in militant circles. One introduction led to another and eventually Vinas met a jihadist commander about to return to Afghanistan. Identified in legal documents as S.S., the commander agreed to let him join his group. CNN has learned from a source briefed on the case that the initials S.S. stand for a man who goes by the name of Shah Saab, and is believed to be somewhere in Pakistan's tribal areas. At the end of September, Vinas was whisked in the commander's car into Pakistan's tribal areas and then across the border into Afghanistan to join up with a small band of fighters targeting a U.S. base. The raid, however, was called off at the last minute because of American aircraft circling above. His quick introduction to the fighting appears to have been unusual. Vinas stated it was standard for fighters to undergo military training before being selected for such missions. Read how al Qaeda training tactics are adapting . It is possible he persuaded his handlers that his brief stint as a U.S. army recruit justified him being fast-tracked; or perhaps the jihadist group just needed more fighters. On his return to Mohmand, a district in Pakistan's tribal areas, Vinas was asked by one of the fighters if he wanted to become a suicide bomber. Vinas, according to his own account, accepted and was sent to Peshawar, Pakistan, for more instruction. But his handlers there judged that he had not received enough religious instruction to launch such an attack. Perhaps it was dawning on them just how valuable an American recruit might one day be. Vinas stated that at this point he traveled back to a village in Waziristan where he spent time with a number of al Qaeda members, including Saudis and Yemenis. In March 2008 he successfully persuaded one of them, a Yemeni he identified as Soufran, to recommend him for formal membership in the terrorist group. Only Soufran's initials appeared in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. His current whereabouts are unknown. According to Vinas, al Qaeda recruits were asked to fill out forms with personal information and hand over their passports when they joined the organization, but were not required to sign a contract or take part in a ceremony to become a member of al Qaeda. Between March and July 2008 Vinas stated that he attended three al Qaeda training courses, which focused on weapons, explosives, and rocket-based or -propelled weaponry. Vinas stated that when training was completed, al Qaeda instructors did a written evaluation of performances. Vinas was judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against U.S. and NATO bases in Afghanistan, according to his account. During his travels Vinas met some of al Qaeda's top leaders, leaders he was able to identify to U.S. authorities after his capture. Read how al Qaeda is looking at Western targets . According to U.S. investigators, quoted by the Los Angeles Times, Vinas says he met with Abu Yayha al Libi, one of al Qaeda's principal spokesmen, and Rashid Rauf, the British al Qaeda operative suspected of coordinating a plot against transatlantic aviation in August 2006. Rauf, who was arrested that August in Pakistan, escaped from custody in December 2007 but is believed to have been killed in a Predator strike in North Waziristan in November 2008. Vinas says he also met with an individual by the name of Abdullah Saeed, whom he says replaced Abu Leith al Libbi as al Qaeda's military chief in Afghanistan and Pakistan in January 2008. A former Jihadist told CNN that Saeed is almost certainly Mustafa Abu Al-Yazid, an Egyptian also known as Sheikh Saeed. In June, Al-Yazid released an audio recording complaining of a lack of funds for the fighting in Afghanistan. Vinas stated he met with Saeed in the late summer of 2008 in Waziristan, and al Qaeda's military chief personally instructed him to join a group of fighters targeting U.S. bases from the tribal areas of Pakistan. In January this year Vinas pleaded guilty to having targeted an American base in September of that year. That attack, however, appears to have been a failure. Creeping up towards the American forward operating base Vinas and other al Qaeda fighters' first attempt to fire on the base was botched by radio problems. The second rocket attack fell short of the base, according to Vinas' account. Vinas' life as an al Qaeda fighter saw him rotate between fighting behind enemy lines in Afghanistan, training in remote mountain dwellings in the tribal areas, and spending downtime in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, where he was eventually arrested in November 2008 and transferred into American custody.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- Growing up in rural North Dakota, about 13 miles from the Canadian border and a 90-minute drive from the nearest McDonald's, Jessica Metcalfe relied on magazines for her pop culture fix. The young Turtle Mountain Chippewa never saw anyone in the pages of Seventeen who looked like her. But as an adult, she's working to change that, promoting the work of Native American fashion designers and artists. She began with the 2009 launch of Beyond Buckskin, a blog that highlights Native designers and discusses their place in media and pop culture. Even Metcalfe was surprised by its initial success -- by the size of its audience, the positive feedback, the readers asking, \"Where can I buy that?\" The blog expanded to include an online boutique last year, placing Metcalfe at the center of a growing movement to reclaim what fashion labels \"Native American.\" She's surrounded by a group of passionate Native designers, artists, stylists, photographers and bloggers who have already proven that by raising their voices they can hold companies accountable. Instead of just reacting to controversies, Metcalfe and her cohorts want to promote authentic examples of modern Native fashion. Their work reflects the diversity of North America's indigenous communities, from the southeastern United States to Canada's Pacific Northwest, but their message is clear: True Native fashion is more than what's for sale at Urban Outfitters or Forever 21. Related: Native Americans fight cultural caricatures . When blogger Adrienne Keene of Native Appropriations outed Paul Frank last year for holding a powwow-themed party, the company not only apologized but invited Keene and Metcalfe to speak at an upcoming industry panel on cultural appropriation. The company is also working with Metcalfe to develop collections featuring four Native designers. Whenever a celebrity dons a feather and long braids for a photo shoot, or a fashion brand releases a gaudy collection of \"totem pole print\" tracksuits, bloggers like Metcalfe and Keene are slammed with questions about why they're offensive. Metcalfe says they should be showing better examples -- tasteful, appropriate use of Native iconography, and talented Native designers. It's the work of Taos designer Patricia Michaels, the first Native American to appear on \"Project Runway;\" the art of Virgil Ortiz, a Cochiti Pueblo artist and designer who collaborated with Donna Karan; the sexy couture gowns of Bethany Yellowtail and other designers who appeared in the first Beyond Buckskin Lookbook launched earlier this month to spotlight Native-made fashion from couture to street wear. \"Creativity is our tradition and there's a lot of talent in Indian Country waiting to be exposed,\" Metcalfe said. Part of the work is advancing mainstream America's perception of Native fashion, going beyond headdresses, fringed jackets and, yes, buckskin. On a practical level, it's about finding places to market and sell Native-made goods, Metcalfe said. The clothing and jewelry isn't only intended for Natives. It's meant to appeal to wide audiences, even if people don't know the significance of a pattern or design. \"These are not your stereotypical Native American designs. They're very contemporary, which is the point: to present new visions of what Native American fashion means,\" said Shelby Tisdale, the vice president of curatorial and exhibitions at Los Angeles' Autry National Center, a Native American history museum. \"They incorporate designs that have a lot of meaning to them, but to the average viewer they might just look like a dragonfly or zigzag lines, and that's OK.\" Metcalfe was a guest curator for a show about Native couture at the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture in Santa Fe, New Mexico, while Tisdale was the museum's director. Metcalfe was completing her dissertation about modern Native American fashion. \"She's done a fabulous job of researching Native fashion's roots, but now she's taking it into the 21st century,\" Tisdale said. \"She's moved it into the digital age, which not might seem like a big deal, but it's new and forward thinking for Indian Country.\" The work occurs beyond Metcalfe's website. They're using fashion shows, pop-up boutiques and speaking engagements to spread their message. In March, Metcalfe was in Las Vegas, Santa Fe and Portland for events promoting Native fashion. Keene joined her for a talk this week, aptly named \"More Than Just Trend,\" at Reed College -- one of many stops they make on college campuses. Related: Atlanta Braves reject \"screaming Indian\" logo . Earlier this year, Metcalfe staged a three-day photo shoot of the latest looks in Native fashion, from couture to street wear, with fashion photographer Anthony Thosh Collins and L.A.-based designer Bethany Yellowtail. The result was the Beyond Buckskin Lookbook, which Metcalfe says is the first compilation of modern Native fashion produced exclusively by Natives. They launched the book in March at the Reservation Economic Summit in Las Vegas, an annual gathering of tribal leaders, state and local elected officials and top CEOs from Indian Country. \"The lookbook is a brilliant indigenous response to the rip-offs being marketed in mainstream media,\" said Valerie Taliman, a citizen of the Navajo Nation and West Coast editor of Indian Country Today Media Network, the largest Native-operated media organization in the country. \"Here, you have a collection of 17 Native artists with all Native models, photographers, graphics artists and business management -- the whole package on their intellectual and cultural terms.\" So, instead of jewelry that's all turquoise and silver, metalsmith Kristen Dorsey creates pieces she says honors the aesthetic traditions of the Chickasaw people. She works with copper, using the same relief sculpture techniques as her ancestors. Her signature \"serpent cuffs\" resemble reptile scales, referring to a deity from southeastern Native American spirituality. The cuffs are adorned with black freshwater pearls harvested from the Mississippi River watershed, a nod to where her tribe lived before the Trail of Tears. Each cuff starts at $700. \"If you have a family or tribal connection it becomes very personal,\" Dorsey said. \"It's more than making jewelry; it becomes working for a culture that you want to pass on to future generations.\" Then there's Jamie Okuma, who contributed two skirts and a jacket to the lookbook. She began working with beads and sewing as a child on the La Jolla Luiseno Reservation in California, and at 22, became the youngest artist to earn best in show at New Mexico's Santa Fe Market, the largest crafts fair in Indian Country. She makes elaborately beaded high heels, colorful jackets and dresses that evoke the patterns of the LuiseÃ±o and Shoshone-Bannock. \"Clothing is wearable art and I want to use my skills to create something beautiful that reflects the cultural heritage of my tribe,\" Okuma said. Okuma said anyone who wants to interpret Native patterns and motifs should be allowed to do so, but they should do it in a respectful way. \"As long as they understand the importance of the symbols or patterns being utilized and they do so in a tasteful way, why not?\" Okuma said. Still, on major store shelves, Native fashion is still most likely to be \"Navajo-inspired\" prints, feathered headdresses or fake turquoise jewelry. The lookbook represents authentic, modern Native imagery, designer and co-creator Bethany Yellowtail said. \"It's disheartening to see Native American fashion as cheap knockoffs,\" Yellowtail said. \"To change that, we have to be the voice for what Native American fashion is, instead of just complaining about it.\" Growing up on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Yellowtail's aunties taught her how to bead and make shawls in the tradition of her people, the Crow and Cheyenne who share the vast tribal territory. Thanks to a high school teacher who encouraged Yellowtail and helped her find a design school, she moved to California, where she broke into a career as a pattern maker. Five years after arriving in Los Angeles, she now divides her creative efforts between a full-time job designing for mass market retail brands and her own line, which is inspired by her love for Native culture and high-end couture, she said. Yellowtail wants to inspire other Natives to follow their passion and show the rest of the world that Native Americans are a thriving, modern people that have plenty to contribute, especially in the fashion world. \"When I was in high school I never imagined that I could be a mover and shaker in the fashion industry as a Native woman,\" she said. \"But now that I'm a part of the industry, there's this window of opportunity for me to be a voice for our communities.\" Follow Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter .\n\n**News 3**:\nOakland, California (CNN) -- \"What is it like to bury both of my kids?\" Dinyal New's voice trails off, unable to continue. She sits in the same pew of her church, listening to the same pastor on the same subject -- the loss of a child. Her two boys, Lee and Lamar, were shot to death, 19 days apart, young victims of Oakland, California's relentless street violence. With a population of nearly 400,000, Oakland has long been known as a Bay Area pocket of urban violence. Its proximity to drug corridors and high poverty are fertile breeding grounds for gang violence. Nearby San Francisco and Silicon Valley are routinely named \"Most Innovative Cities in America,\" yet Oakland makes it on very different lists with one of the highest gang homicide rates and robbery levels in the country. Last year, Oakland police touted a 28% drop in murders, the biggest reduction in homicides since 2004. After two years of rising death tolls, Oakland's police chief credited the drop in homicides -- from 131 in 2012 to 90 in 2013 -- to the city's violence reduction strategy which targets the most violent gangs. But because of Oakland's size, its reduced homicide rate still makes it one of the most dangerous cities in the country, with a murder every four days. After riots, California city gets new police chief . New's youngest son, Lee Weathersby III, died on January 1, Oakland's first murder of 2014. A gunman approached the 13-year-old on New Year's Eve as he walked home from the Boys and Girls Club, and shot him 28 times. Teachers, family members and others who knew him best say Lee wasn't in a gang. The eighth grader loved to play drums in band. Neighbors said Lee was a good boy. He stayed at home playing video games or hung out at the Boys and Girls Club, while his single mother worked as a social worker. It's unclear why Lee was targeted. Surveillance video turned over to Oakland police shows him walking down the street, his youth apparent in his gait. He was walking home from the bus stop. Usually he called his mom to pick him up, but his cell phone battery had died. On the video, his mother says you can see a gunman approach, carrying a semi-automatic rifle. Minority kids impacted by zero-tolerance laws . Dinyal New was at home, watching local news of the aftermath of another shooting in her neighborhood. The report showed video of a gurney being loaded into an ambulance, with the on-screen graphic, \"Teen shot.\" She'd seen it hundreds of times -- just another kid shot in Oakland. Hours later, she rushed to the hospital with her oldest son Lamar where she was called to identify Lee's body. She looked up at a television in the waiting room and saw the local news report again. This time it hit her: it was Lee in that news report, his body being loaded into the ambulance. \"Thirteen years old. Just a baby, just a baby.\" Another son gunned down . Lamar Broussard had started straightening out his life after occasional run-ins with the law, including a stint in juvenile detention. The 19-year-old had been taking classes at the local community college. He was close to his younger brother, Lee -- so close that the two still slept together in the same bed. After Lee's death, Dinyal New worried about Lamar. Her youngest son, who was never in trouble, had clearly been a target. Was it a message to Lamar? Fearing for her older son's safety, New asked Lamar to leave Oakland. But with the bravado of youth, Lamar convinced his mother he was safe. After losing Lee, New wanted to get back into a routine, back to her career as a case worker for the homeless, but says she was exhausted by her grief. Then, three days after Lee's funeral, on January 19, she asked Lamar to run an errand for her, to pay her cell phone bill. He was two blocks from home when friends started calling her phone. There had been gunfire in the neighborhood, they told her. New ran towards the corner, and spotted the yellow police tape. \"I see my son's car shot up. And I just broke down crying.\" She couldn't approach the car. She could see from 20 yards away what had happened. \"The suspect stood on top of the car and just shot into the car. Just shot into the car.\" She called Lamar repeatedly from her cell phone. \"He never answered. He never answered.\" There was no logic in it, she says, because she already knew in her heart that Lamar was gone. In 19 days, Dinyal New went from a mother of two, to a mother of none. Oakland police will not say whether the murders of Dinyal's sons are gang-related, but because they are brothers, police say their deaths \"are possibly related.\" New's horror may be extraordinary, but losing a child to gun violence is a common experience in Oakland, says Naomi Harry. \"This city is full of mourning mothers,\" she says. Harry's son was shot on a city bus, coming home from school. He survived. Alicia Waters' son Jamal Waters was not so lucky. He was shot and killed on Oakland's streets six years ago. His murder is still unsolved. Burying your child defies the natural order, says Waters. But she says it's normal in Oakland. \"It's beyond sickening to me,\" says Waters. \"No parent should ever, ever have to bury their kids. Especially like this. This is crazy. I can no longer see mothers bury their kids anymore. I just can't.\" Waters drops her head, the tears still fresh six years after she buried her son. Trying to make a difference . Todd Walker thinks of himself as the mop-up man to Oakland's violence. He often picks up the bodies of young African-American men lost to gun violence, after the coroner's work is complete. He plugs the bullet holes with plastic screws so the fluid doesn't stain the white satin of the casket, so mothers can see their sons one last time. Walker estimates he's put a few hundred children, or \"babies\" as he calls them, into caskets. He picked up both Lee and Lamar's bodies on his gurney. \"I'm tired of it,\" says Walker, 52. \"I'm the one who sees them firsthand at the coroner's office. I'm the one who's got to identify them right off the top. The mother's calling you: How does their kid look? Sometimes ... the kid's been shot up so bad they can't even identify them. It's real sad.\" Walker held Dinyal New's hand as she picked out her second casket this month. He's done this hundreds of times -- but still finds himself at a loss for words. \"Ain't too much you can say to her. It's horrible.\" A life-long East Bay resident, Walker also coaches Pop Warner football for the neighborhood boys. When he started picking up the bodies of the very boys he coached, Walker pledged to try and make a difference. He began inviting children and their parents into the MWJ Mortuary funeral home and walked them through the embalming process. During these tours, in which he hopes to show young people the sober reality of life on the streets, Walker opens up the empty caskets and closes the lid on the children. \"That's how it ends,\" he tells the visitors. His program, which he now calls Restoring Inner City Peace, or R.I.P., has proven so popular that teachers now invite him to schools. For classroom visits, which can be for children as young as kindergarten, Walker brings body bags and zips the children inside. His message is always the same: There is nothing romantic about guns and street life -- only finality and darkness. \"Gun violence is a regular, everyday thing. There's shooting everyday. All these kids do not have an education, but they have a gun. And there's something wrong with that picture. ... To me, the city is failing these kids,\" he says. Walker says that even the horror of Dinyal New's story will fade after Lamar is buried. \"A month or two from now, it'll be over with,\" he says. \"We'll be talking about something different. That's how it goes, year after year.\" Still, New is trying to make Lamar's service special. She's decorating the program in his favorite colors, green and white. She's asked their god-sister to read at the service. \"I need to bury him right. I need to do a good job,\" she says. New can make it through today. The family and the neighborhood will fill the church. She'll have plenty of support for Lamar's funeral. But tomorrow? She'll be alone.\n\n**News 4**:\nUnion City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- David Stottlemyre was inside an oil field repair shop in El Reno, Oklahoma, when he saw a tornado \"looking at us dead in the eye.\" The lifelong Oklahoman said he and two co-workers stayed inside as the building took a direct hit; the roof collapsed and the structure blew apart. Though the three survived unscathed, \"We're all pretty shook up,\" the oil field mechanic told CNN. \"Surreal, really no other way to explain it.\" Friday evening's twisters killed at least nine people, two of them children, and injured scores more in Oklahoma, the office of the city's medical examiner said. Five victims had not been identified. Canadian County Undersheriff Chris West said the seven fatalities in his county were inside vehicles. Oklahoma City-area hospitals treated 104 people for injuries related to the storm, the state health department said. Eleven were still being treated as of 5:15 p.m. (6:15 p.m. ET), hospital officials said. A National Weather Service survey team found damage indicating an EF3 tornado had struck near El Reno, 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. EF3s pack gusts of 136 to 165 mph. The strongest tornado is an EF5. It measured peak rainfall of 7.9 inches 45 miles east of Oklahoma City, outside Meeker. How to help . The storms came less than two weeks after a monstrous EF5 tornado turned parts of Moore, a suburb of Oklahoma City, into rubble. \"There's just no rest,\" city spokeswoman Kristy Yager said. In all, 17 tornadoes were reported in the Midwest. The number was expected to change when officials conduct storm surveys, said Kurt Van Speybroeck, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. At one point, some 200,000 customers were without power in the Midwest, most of them in Missouri and Oklahoma, though that number fell significantly as Saturday wore on. Three Oklahoma City-area medical facilities were running on generators Saturday, the health department said. Tornado damage 'sobering' While twisters damaged houses in Missouri and Illinois, Oklahoma City and its surrounding areas, including El Reno and Union City, were hit hardest. The storm system swatted down power lines and uprooted trees, flicked big rigs on their sides and yanked off part of the terminal roof at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport, where some 1,500 area residents had taken shelter in a tunnel. Get up to speed on the massive storm . \"We're just grateful we were able to get everybody down there,\" airport spokeswoman Karen Carney told CNN. A power outage and debris on the runway -- caused by 80 mph winds, not a tornado -- at one point forced the airport to cancel all flights. Service resumed Saturday, when the lights flickered back on to reveal water damage to the walls, counters and floors, Carney said. One twister tore open Kris Meritt's parents' brick house like a carton, sucking out its contents and tossing most of them onto the lawn. It spared the walls and part of the roof, then moved on to raze the house next door. The parents returned to survey the damage, but rushed off when another tornado was headed their way. \"It's a sobering thing to think about life, and to see all your memories just tossed about,\" Merritt said. \"Everything from your childhood on up.\" Though Friday's tornadoes were not as strong as the EF5 twister that killed 24 people on May 20, fear drove some people into their cars to flee, ignoring warnings not to drive. Officials described parts of Interstates 35 and 40 near Oklahoma City as \"a parking lot.\" \"People were actually driving southbound in the northbound lanes to try and get out of the way,\" said storm chaser Dave Holder. J. Marshall Shepherd, president of the American Meteorological Society and director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia, said Saturday that should not have occurred. \"We knew well in advance these storms were going to be quite dangerous,\" he told CNN. \"The weather service was crystal clear, to stay off the roads after 4 p.m. yesterday.\" In Moore, the storms affected residents still picking up the pieces from the previous disaster. \"There's damage everywhere,\" Mayor Glenn Lewis told CNN's Anderson Cooper. 'Overwhelmed' by rains, flooding . Most of Lewis' already devastated town blacked out Friday night, with flooded streets adding to the headaches. \"I can't even get home to see if my house is OK,\" the Moore mayor said Friday night. Eight to 11 inches of rain hosed Oklahoma City, drenching the area, Yager said. Get up to speed on the massive storm . An inch of water pooled on the first floor of City Hall, and apartments in low-lying areas of town were hit harder. \"We've seen widespread flooding throughout the entire 621 square miles,\" she said. Flooding stranded some motorists. \"We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding,\" said police Lt. Jay Barnett. \"We were overwhelmed.\" 3 die by drowning in Missouri . The impact of the severe weather spread beyond Oklahoma. A powerful storm caused major damage to a gymnasium of Gillespie High School in southwestern Illinois, with bricks piled up from what had been the gym's front now piled up on the school's lawn, Gillespie Mayor John Hicks said. Seven to 10 homes were destroyed, and more than 30 others suffered damage, in the storm. Thankfully, though, no one died or was significantly injured in the town of about 3,400 people. Gillespie's mayor said things might have been much different had the storm struck next week, when hundreds were set to gather not far from the high school for a celebration called Black Diamond Days. In Missouri, Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, as the storm front moved into his state stripping sidings and roofs off homes and causing deadly flooding. A tornado in St. Charles and St. Louis counties left a path \"over 10 miles of significant damage ... that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KSDK on Saturday. Aerial video from CNN affiliate KMOV showed the second floors of several homes ripped apart, with houses to the front and behind still standing. In one home, a man walked across the exposed second floor, walls and roof gone, at one point picking up what appeared to be a picture as he negotiated debris on all sides. Nearby, shirts still hung on one side of what used to be a closet. Also damaged was the 10,000-seat Family Arena in St. Charles, county spokesman Colene McEntee told CNN. The damage led three high schools in the Francis Howell school district to cancel graduation ceremonies that had been scheduled for Saturday, KSDK reported. No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in the state, according to Nixon. Problems with high waters aren't necessarily going away, especially in the southern part of the state. \"Waters are rising, floods are still occurring, and we're asking people to be very safe,\" the governor said Saturday afternoon. Moore re-traumatized . In Moore, the howls of civil defense sirens sent storm-weary residents scrambling again. Candace Looper retreated to her windowless laundry room with her cat and stacked couch pillows on top of her. \"I've been praying, and I've been singing 'The Lord's Prayer' and singing 'Amazing Grace,' so I'm OK,\" she told CNN. LaDonna Cobb and her husband, Steve, were with their children at their school on May 20 when a tornado demolished the building. A photograph of Steve Cobb carrying one of their daughters with his wife looking to him with blood on her face emerged as a symbol of Moore's suffering and resilience. Friday's tornadoes drove them into a shelter and put fear into their hearts again. \"We're terrified,\" Cobb told CNN's Piers Morgan. The second tornado was particular unsettling for their children. \"They were not handling it very well. They were pretty upset,\" Cobb said. Once it passed, Lewis, the city mayor, rode around town in his pickup. \"This is unbelievable that it could possibly even hit again,\" he said. \"We just started picking up (debris) two days ago.\" CNN's Nick Valencia reported from El Reno, Oklahoma; George Howell reported from Union City, Oklahoma; and Holly Yan and Ben Brumfield from Atlanta.

If confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the worker's case would mark the first known transmission of Ebola in the United States and the second-ever diagnosis in the country. With developments pouring in from all corners of the world, here's what you need to know to quickly get caught up: . WEST AFRICA . No relief in sight: . The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has climbed to 4,033, the World Health Organization reported Friday. The tally brings the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola to 8,399. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. A possible $32 billion hit: . The outbreak could cost the African economy $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors, the World Bank estimates. The steps some countries have taken to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus amount to \"putting a towel under the door of a building on fire,\" World Bank president Jim Kim told CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday. Complete coverage on Ebola . Liberia postpones election: . Liberia's President on Thursday postponed a senatorial election that had been set for this week, citing the Ebola outbreak in the country. The nation's election commission had recommended the delay, saying the prevalence of the virus, authorities' efforts to combat it and citizens' efforts to isolate themselves weren't conducive to a free and open election. Officials have not yet revealed any new date for the election, which had been set for Tuesday. U.S. troops arrive in Liberia: . A group of 90 U.S. Marines and airmen arrived in Liberia on Thursday to help Ebola response efforts, along with four V-22 Osprey aircraft and two C-130 transport planes. Their arrival brings the total number of U.S. troops deployed in Liberia to 334, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said. There are more coming. In late October, 700 troops from the 101st Airborne Division are scheduled to deploy to Liberia. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . U.S. CASES . New case in Texas: . A person who helped to treat Thomas Eric Duncan may be the first person to contract the disease while in the United States. The health care worker from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital tested positive in a preliminary test Saturday after reporting a low-grade fever Friday. The CDC is working to confirm the diagnosis. 'Modest improvement' for NBC cameraman: . The family of NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, is cautiously optimistic after doctors said his condition at a Nebraska hospital has improved slightly. Mukpo, an American citizen, has shown \"very modest improvement,\" according to The Nebraska Medical Center, where he is being treated. Mukpo is receiving an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001. \"Mr. Mukpo's condition is slightly improved,\" medical director Dr. Phil Smith said. \"He's been taking in some fluids and drinking Gatorade. But everyone needs to be reminded that this is still a very serious illness we're dealing with and no one has a lot of experience treating it.\" Thomas Duncan dies: . Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday, 10 days after he was admitted to Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. His family wonders whether the outcome would have been different if doctors had admitted him to a hospital on September 25, the first time he showed up with a fever and stomach pain. Duncan's family has criticized the care he received. The Dallas hospital that treated him says staff members did everything they could. Ebola test negative for Dallas deputy: . An Ebola test was negative for a Dallas deputy who was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the deadly virus, officials said. The deputy, Sgt. Michael Monnig, didn't have any direct contact with Duncan but had reported contact with Duncan's family. Physicians at Texas Health Presbyterian discharged him Thursday, soon after the negative test came back, hospital spokeswoman Candace White said. New travel screening: . Five of America's biggest, busiest airports are beefing up measures. On Saturday, people arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola started getting special screening, including having their temperature taken, at New York's JFK airport. Washington's Dulles, Newark, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta international airports will begin screening Thursday. Ebola worries spread: . In New York, fire officials said a patient in Brooklyn with Ebola-like symptoms had recently returned from the North African country of Sudan, the New York Daily News reported. The patient was undergoing tests, but the New York Health Department said there were no patients in the city suspected of having Ebola. The patient was \"never at risk for Ebola and never met the definition of an Ebola suspect,\" the Health Department said. Sudan is far removed from the West African center of the outbreak -- as far away from it as Atlanta is from Los Angeles. Still, fear of the often deadly disease has bred much caution. \"I have seen several people who had acute illnesses worried that they may have Ebola,\" said Dr. Mark Reiter, an emergency room physician in Tennessee and president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine. Reiter said many patients in his state are unlikely candidates, not having been to West Africa, nor having had any contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient. \"But it has gotten a tremendous amount of media coverage and some people are especially concerned about it, even if it is highly unlikely,\" Reiter said. In Los Angeles, a patient who was isolated at Centinela Hospital's emergency room after being transported from Los Angeles International Airport earlier this week has undergone all necessary tests required by the CDC and Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The patient was approved for discharge. Linda Bradley, hospital CEO, said the patient, who had traveled recently from Liberia, underwent numerous tests, which came back negative. Cuban doctors train, then fight Ebola in Africa . IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Spain Ebola patient has no significant change in condition: . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, \"is conscious and talking\" but was in \"stable but serious\" condition Saturday after taking a turn for the worse earlier in the week. She has been treated with the anti-influenza drug Avigan, hospital sources with knowledge of the case said. Spain ramps up response: . After Romero became the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, 16 people related to the case were being monitored in a Madrid hospital, including an emergency room doctor, the neighborhood doctor who saw her before the case was confirmed, and the nurse's husband, according to a government source. A special committee created by the Spanish government to tackle the Ebola crisis reported no significant changes in her condition. The committee, which will include representatives from government and health care, will coordinate national efforts to control the virus and establish protocols to deal with it, the source said. A nurse under observation at the hospital tested negative for the Ebola virus, the committee said. The nurse has been discharged but will remain under observation outside the hospital until her quarantine ends on October 16, the committee said. Sporadic infections unavoidable, the WHO says: . Sporadic Ebola infections will be unavoidable in some European countries because of direct travel from their hubs to hotspot areas in West Africa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. But the risk of spread, it said, is avoidable and extremely low. Australia scare: . A 57-year-old woman who returned to Australia after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has been isolated at a hospital and is undergoing tests, including one for the deadly virus, authorities said. She had isolated herself at home and checked her temperature twice daily since her return, as recommended by national guidelines. The Queensland Department of Health announced early Friday that initial tests on the woman came back negative for Ebola. United Kingdom: . The UK's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar railway terminals will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, a government spokesman said. Screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and future travel arrangements, as well as a possible assessment performed by medical personnel.

So after the drubbing the party took at the ballot box in 2012 -- failing to win the White House and losing seats in the House -- Priebus ordered a much-talked about top-down review of the party in an effort to stop Republicans for taking big losses during presidential elections. The report -- titled the \"Growth & Opportunity Plan\" -- was stark and blunt, challenging the Republican Party to make substantial changes to the way it interacted with voters. Republicans want to end perception as 'stuffy old men' Less than a year after the report was released and as Republicans nationally venture to Washington for the group's winter confab, Priebus and other Republican leaders are looking back on 2013 and heralding the moves they made in implementing their plan. \"A lot of it comes down to mechanics,\" Priebus said. \"Here is the point, if you are not in Hispanic communities on a year-round basis. If you don't represent those congressional districts, if you don't represent those Senate districts, who is there? Who is there telling the story of the Republican Party, of opportunity and freedom.\" There are fundamental areas that RNC re-tooling has focused on: improving a lackluster ground game, growing Republican standing in minority communities, investing in a data infrastructure and revamping the GOP primary system. All of this, Priebus and others said, is in an effort to turn into a year-round organization with a sustainable presence in crucial states. After President Barack Obama beat Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the way to winning reelection in 2012, many in the party felt changes needed to be made. As the GOP report touts on one of its first pages, it had \"lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections\" and Obama just won the Hispanic vote by a whopping 44%, African Americans by over 80% and Asians by 47%. In response to these losses, according to Jennifer Korn, the RNC's deputy political director and the head of demographic specific outreach, the party has put minority engagement staff in sixteen states. The RNC is especially proud of that - pointing out that 78% of the RNC's political staff is outside of Washington, D.C., -- but not fully satisfied. If they had their way, the RNC would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states. And Korn believes this plan has already been a success, pointing to the fact that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey won 50% of the Hispanic vote on the way to his reelection in 2013. Korn, who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House, said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County, New Jersey, a county Christie turned red in 2013. \"This is a permanent, year round effort,\" Korn said. \"We will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote, but to build relationships and listen to their concerns.\" But not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed. On the top of that list: the report's suggestion that Republicans should \"embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\" \"If we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,\" wrote the five Republican authors of the report, which also stated that the RNC believes \"comprehensive immigration reform\" is \"consistent\" with Republican policies to \"promote job growth and opportunity for all.\" After passing the Senate, immigration reform has stalled in the Republican controlled House. What's more, Republican's who supported the measure - like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - have taken a beating with the party's base for that support. Reid: Boehner will compromise on immigration reform . The other much talked about suggestion, that Republicans need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues, has proven hard to change. \"It's not just what we say; it's how we say it,\" Priebus said when the report was published. But a number of high profile comments have undermined the GOP effort. Examples: When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have \"calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert\" or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said \"the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.\" Priebus, who has called out some of the more outlandish comments, seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year. \"This idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world\" is not realistic, Preibus told CNN on Wednesday, the first day of the meeting. \"In one year, is the world carpeted? No. But we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny.\" Democrats have watched this rebranding with amusement. Every time someone like King makes an eye-popping statement or when the RNC, like it is doing this week, considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance, Democrats have questioned the validity of the plan. In an e-mail on Tuesday, Marcy Stech, spokeswoman for Emily's List, a liberal woman's group, said the RNC abortion proposal shows the party is \"misfiring on that rebrand\" and \"Republicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason.\" \"This is yet another example of the Republican Party being tone-deaf to American voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake, PR solution,\" Stech wrote. \"Maybe, in 2014, they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want, and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they don't.\" Priebus, quite expectedly, doesn't see it that way. Instead of saying the resolution pushes Republicans to talk about their pro-life stances, the chairman said the idea is that \"the point of the resolution is don't stand there like s sitting duck, like a fool, and get punched in the face\" when Democrats challenge Republican on abortion. While tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the RNC changes, the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012. Kirsten Kurkowski, the RNC's spokeswoman, said the party has \"fundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community-based and bottom up,\" is \"closing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology\" and has \"united behind the need for changes in the debate system.\" The debate system as been an important, albeit quiet, focus of the RNC after the 2012 loss. For much of 2013, a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012. Those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week's RNC meeting. \"I don't think we need a six-month slice and dice festival on our party,\" Priebus said. \"I think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary. And like I said, look I can't always control people's mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other. \" As for more comments that strike a tone the RNC would rather not take, most GOP committee members in Washington for the winter meeting know they are inevitable. \"We wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say, but we don't have a magic wand,\" said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour. \"I think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight. We have to keep educating our members, or governors, as well as our candidates, to think about what you say and how you say it.\" His advice to members who have a penchant for strong statements: \"Speak in a way that unites people and is not shrill. Shrill doesn't sell.\"\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- At long last, Maria Toorpakai Wazir can indulge her life's greatest love without fear of persecution. Hounded out of the notoriously dangerous tribal region that borders Pakistan and Afghanistan -- once referred to as \"Hell's door knocker\" -- salvation has been found thousands of miles away on a different continent. She survived death threats, spent countless hours alone in her room and masqueraded as a boy for years. And all for her love of squash. Now Pakistan's number one female player, who is ranked 53rd in the world, is homing in on her quest to become the best female player in the world, under the tutelage of Jonathon Power, the Canadian star whose name was inscribed on the first racket she ever owned. It is a fairytale story that has taken the 22-year-old a world away from a treacherous existence in the mountains of Pakistan, to Power's academy in Toronto, and morphed her into an agent for social change in her native country. \"I think positive and I do positive so I think people in Pakistan need to be educated, need to take part in sports and skills so they have high integrity, high self-esteem and so they use energy in a positive way,\" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. \"They will start holding rackets and bats rather than holding guns and grenades. I don't want militancy or Talibanisation -- I just want a brighter future for all the kids. I don't want them to end up as suicide bombers.\" Growing up in South Waziristan provided Wazir with a crash course in conservatism, a prevalent theme in a territory with a reputation for fierce tribalism. \"It was an area in between mountains and mud houses and as it was 100 or 200 years ago,\" she explained. \"The girls are deprived of all those basic rights. They stay inside the home and get married off at a young age. \"My whole family was different to the rest of the people in the area -- you could see the progress, the different mindset -- but they were still living in the Stone Age. \"They had no awareness about education or any health or exercise, or women's rights or child's rights. They didn't know how any education can be important for one person as a human.\" Exasperated at the barriers placed in front of her, Wazir took drastic action aged just four, burning all her dresses, putting on her brother's clothes and shearing off her long, dark hair. \"My dad believes that it is your choice and your right to live the way you want,\" she said. \"He laughed and he gave me a boyish name Genghis Khan, the greatest warrior in the history of the world. He said 'So, we have a fifth son, and his name is Genghis Khan.'\" However for Wazir and her family, domestic tolerance came at a price. In a society cloaked by repression and inequality, even being seen unaccompanied in public could be perceived as a betrayal of her culture and Muslim religion. And the liberal attitude of her father, Shamsul Qayyum Wazir, who encouraged his wife to continue her education and allowed their daughter to play outside with her brothers, was contradictory to the prevailing attitude of ultra-conservatism. So much so that he family decided they'd had enough after a campaign of intimidation that included the stoning of the family house, attempts on their lives and an imposed spell in an asylum for the father. The family moved to the city of Peshawar -- another Taliban stronghold -- where Wazir's scrapes intensified, with one scuffle leading to a head injury that required 12 stitches. Realizing she needed to channel this aggression, her father enrolled her in weightlifting classes at a local sports club, keeping up the pretense she was a boy. Wazir went on to win a junior weightlifting championship, but she also grew fixated on squash, having seen it played on her breaks from training. She earned a place at a squash academy run by the Pakistan Air Force, though she had to reveal her true identity to the director. Such was his delight at seeing a girl enraptured by squash he donated a racket to Maria bearing the name of Jonathon Power -- who won 36 top level events during his 15-year career at the top of the sport. But as word spread of her emerging talent, the anonymity Wazir had reveled in for so long evaporated. \"Attitudes changed, they started bullying but I used to find a way,\" she explained. \"I used to go early in the morning when there was no-one in my way. \"I used to repair those balls that were bad and torn in the squash court that guys used to throw away with tape and glue.\" Taliban's unwanted attention . A steady improvement in her game led to appearances in high profile tournaments and prominence in the Pakistani media. Awards from then president Pervez Musharraf and prime minister Shaukat Aziz were a mark of her pioneering spirit, but they also attracted the Taliban's unwanted attention. \"It was exhausting at every step,\" she said. \"It was hard to let people know all I want is to play squash. That's how I can live happy but I had to change my life with time. \"For the last eight years I've been trying hard to come through to the common people and today I'm getting threats from Taliban. I was totally exhausted. I didn't know what to do. \"I stopped going to the academy because it's the biggest dishonor if a daughter is kidnapped. That's (why) I locked myself in my room and started hitting from evening to morning.\" Her absence was noted and when she relayed the threats she'd received the issue was debated in parliament, who reacted by beefing up security around her. \"They put so many attack posts on the way to the squash court and around the squash court too,\" she said. \"Above the squash court they put snipers. \"I was going once a week or twice a month but at that time I completely stopped because if a bomb happened -- there is so much glass in the squash court itself -- it would kill the innocent kids. \"I didn't want it to be the reason so I stopped going and started playing in my room for three-and-a-half years.\" It was during this time Wazir says she knew she had to leave Pakistan to follow her dream. \"My dad said 'If a baby bird wants to learn flying, he has to leave the nest' and at that time I realized I cannot learn flying while am here. \"For three-and-a-half years I didn't get any email from anyone and one day I got an email back from Jonathan Power saying that he's going to help me, support me, teach me how to play squash so I can play at tournaments and become a world champion for Pakistan.\" Power himself was sent to London as a 12-year-old to train with former Pakistani world champion and all-time squash great Jahangir Khan, and was immersed in the culture of Khan's country, traveling to play there on many occasions during his career. Wazir's plea struck a chord with Power, who flew her to Toronto and has since been working on building her strength and stamina, and molding the rawness of her technique into a formidable weapon. \"I recognized right away this girl is special, she's very courageous girl and I wanted to help,\" said Power. \"She'll run through that wall 10 times until she finally breaks it. She thinks working hard just means killing your body and you'll get better, but sometimes you have to work smart. \"It's so rare to find somebody who has so much drive and so much passion, who is just dying to absorb knowledge. I think she's going to make it to number one in the world. \"She knows it's going to take a lot and she's prepared to sacrifice whatever it takes. I think she has the skills and the mental ability to make it all the way.\" Building bridges . As for Wazir, her ambition to be the finest player on the world is now allied to a desire to campaign for other young girls in Pakistan to have the freedom to explore sport. \"I feel the luckiest person and I think whether my hard work turned me into being lucky or if I am the chosen one to bring change to the world,\" she said. \"I learned it's more about humanity. It's not about religion, it's not about culture or caste or tribe or where you're from or the value of the background of the person. \"It's all about being a human. I learned a lot and squash taught me. Through squash I made it and learned otherwise I'd be stuck in those tribal regions. \"I want to create bridges between east and west, friendship between country and country, family to family and people to people. It's all about brotherhood -- sharing knowledge, skills, helping each other and sharing love and care for each other.\"\n\n**News 4**:\nVancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Heroin, cocaine and amphetamines are the kind of street drugs you expect to find in the shady corners of any city, hiding away from the glare of law enforcement. But in one small space in downtown Vancouver addicts openly inject their fixes -- as medics watch on. This is InSite, North America's only legal safe drug injection center. A banner outside reads \"InSite saves lives.\" It's a facility where drug addicts can bring and use their drugs and not risk arrest. Some of the addicts line up two or three times a day to use one of the 12 injection booths. One of the first users of the day is Steve. The center opens at 10 a.m. and then runs steadily for 18 hours until 4 a.m. Approximately 800 people use the booths every day. Steve gives his alias to the receptionist -- all InSite users have an official alias to protect their identity -- and moves into the injection room. He takes a seat and calmly begins to prepare his hit of heroin. He uses the clean needle and sterile equipment provided by InSite. The white powder is mixed with water in a spoon, gently heated with a candle, before being drawn into the syringe, and injected into the inside of Steve's elbow. It's not for the squeamish. There's quite a lot of blood. With fluorescent lighting and lots of mirrors, the atmosphere is clinical, even as the room fills with drug addicts focused on one task only -- feeding their addiction. Medical staff are on hand and watching closely. If needed they can help addicts find the right vein to shoot up into -- something which can be tricky for long-term users. But their main job is to step in when a user overdoses. Steve has overdosed here three times. \"I'm glad it was here [where I overdosed]. It's still in my hope that maybe I can get clean. I'm only 48. And that's why these places ... it's just, it's common sense! When you have a problem that's grown for whatever reason to the epic proportions that it has in this city, it's time to come up with a really good solution, and this is it.\" Vancouver is regularly lauded as one of the best places in the world to live. It's famously the city where you can ski in the morning, and swim in the afternoon. But the quality of life in the alleyways behind InSite is something altogether different. The Downtown East side is often labeled as the poorest postal code in Canada, which stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city's red hot real estate market. The alleyways are full of thousands of drug addicts, prostitutes and dealers. Vancouver Police Department estimates that these few blocks are home to more than 5,000 intravenous drug users. In the alleys we meet Liane -- another long-term user - who has used InSite since it opened in 2003. She is articulate, educated, and angry. She says that without InSite addicts would be still be getting high but without any of the medical oversight. To many around the world it may seem astonishing that a place like InSite exists. But for the people in the nearby streets who use it, it's a lifeline. Clean needles stop the spread of infections like HIV and Hepatitis C, and daily access to medical staff is all the more important for people living in harsh, exposed conditions. In 1997, Vancouver had the highest rate of HIV in the developed world. Using InSite makes sense, says Liane. It relieves the pressure of shooting up behind rubbish bins, or using dirty puddle water, or relying on a shared needle. \"We have to stop making it a moral issue and realise that this is a medical problem. Remember us addicts, we're somebody's mothers, we're somebody's sister, we're somebody's daughter -- we're not just a number -- the next time you pass me on the street and shake your head.\" Of course not everyone agrees with safe injection sites. Author, actor, and addiction counselor, David Berner, opened Canada's first ever residential treatment center for addicts back in 1967. He firmly believes that the best harm reduction strategies are centered on abstinence. \"There's only one problem with this place [InSite]. It ignores completely the mechanics of addiction. What are the mechanics of addiction? The mechanics of addiction are I want more. \"I understand reaching out and saying, 'Betty, Jack, you want to get clean? Let's go do some work. Let's get clean. It can happen, you can do it.' I don't understand, 'here's a needle, go shoot some more.'\" InSite is funded by taxpayers, at a cost of $3 million Canadian per year. It says for every tax dollar spent, four are saved, by preventing expensive medical treatments for addicts further down the line. The center has some support from the mayor, local government and some residents. The opening of InSite was a major campaign issue in Vancouver's 2002 civic elections. Supervised injection sites are not supported, however, by the Canadian federal government. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's opposition to InSite is well-documented. Speaking in 2005, he said: \"We as a government will not fund drug use.\" His then health minister, Tony Clement, went further in a 2008 letter to Canada's \"Globe and Mail\" newspaper: \"A more apt analogy of what InSite does ... would be a doctor holding a cigarette to make sure a smoker doesn't burn his lips, or watching a woman with cardiac problems eat fatty French fries to ensure she swallows them properly.\" The site is allowed to stay open only with a special license -- the result of a bitter battle with the Canadian government that went to the Canadian Supreme Court. In September 2011 judges ruled in favor of keeping InSite open against the wishes of Prime Minister Harper. The court said InSite allows drug addicts access to the same healthcare as other Canadian citizens. The dramatic Supreme Court ruling set a precedent and other cities in Canada, including Toronto and Montreal, had been watching closely. Councilor Gord Perks is chairman of the Toronto Drug Strategy. \"The Supreme Court ruling is a game changer. Now actually it's the law of the land that we have to provide equal access to medical services, including to people with drug addiction. So we've made progress.\" A four-year study into the viability of injection rooms in Ontario province recommended three sites in Toronto, and two more in Ottawa - the nation's capital. But the findings of the Toronto and Ottawa Supervised Consumption Assessment Study (TOSCA), published in 2012, were swiftly rejected by the Toronto city administration. Toronto's drug problem is not as visible as Vancouver's but it's still there, with about 9,000 people in the city shooting up daily. As TOSCA revealed, more than 50 percent of the public supported the opening of an injection room in Ontario. Perks thinks it's only a matter of time. \"We've started to get people to face the very difficult fact that if you do not provide this medical service you are killing people. And I think it's only a few years away until we have a supervised injection site here in Toronto.\" Injection rooms exist in a number of countries. The first opened in Switzerland in 1986, and since then Australia, Norway, Spain, Germany and others have followed suit. Accepting injection rooms as a legitimate part of drug strategy is hard for Berner to comprehend. \"It's more humane to help a person stay stupid? To help a person stay enslaved? You don't need to have heroin or needles or crack pipe kits to entice people to health. You could approach people and say, \"let me look at that sore. I'm a nurse. Let's clean you up a bit.\"\" But for people like Liane, it's a harsh reality that she may never get off drugs. She has been using for 20 years and InSite is her best hope of staying connected with medical and welfare services. \"I'm entitled to healthcare, and being treated like a human being, and not being looked at as somebody that isn't, somebody you don't want to talk about, like a dirty little secret. \"InSite in general, it's saved my life once, and it saved my husband's life on three different occasions.\" She has a swift retort when asked whether other cities should open injection rooms. \"Do they have drug users? And if the answer is yes, then the answer is embrace it.\" Todd Schwarzchild contributed to this report ."}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7598, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- It was a golden moment in a depressingly bleak week. Ukraine's female biathletes provided a temporary and joyful distraction from the ongoing troubles at home with a gold medal performance in the women's team biathlon relay on Friday at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The team led from start to finish in the 4x6 km race, taking gold in a time of one hour 10 minutes 2.5 seconds, 26.4 seconds ahead of defending champions Russia with Norway a further 11.2 seconds behind in third. Vita Semerenko, a bronze medalist in the women's 7.5 km sprint earlier in the Games, led Ukraine's women off before handing over to Juliya Dzhyma for the second leg. Valj Semerenko's twin sister Valj lost some time at the shooting range on the third leg but not enough to deny Ukraine their first Olympic biathlon gold as anchorwoman Olena Pidhrushna fell into the arms of her teammates at the finish line. \"Before the race people wrote us many messages and wishes, waiting for victory,\" Pidhrushna said after clinching her country's first Winter Games gold in 20 years. \"Until the very last moment, even this morning I read my emails, saying like 'Girls, start and win for us all, for Ukraine.' We are so happy that the people of Ukraine are happy back home and that something good happened for our country.\" Pidhrushna, who called for a minute's silence at the press conference following the event, was asked about her husband, Alexie Kayda who is a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament. \"He talked to me and he said he didn't know how to support me and improve my mood. Before a race, he tells me that he loves me and that he believes in me,\" she said. \"I can only thank for him for trying to protect me from everything that is happening at home. We only know the minimum of what is happening there and that is a good thing.\" Former pole vault world record-holder Sergei Bubka, who now heads Ukraine's Olympic Committee, couldn't contain his delight. \"Ukraine wins gooooold!\" he tweeted before praising Pidhrushna and co. for their efforts for winning Ukraine's first biathlon gold. Bubka, who won gold at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, told CNN's Amanda Davies that he was praying for a good result after violence had erupted in Ukraine's capital Kiev causing scores of deaths. \"We need this. We need this and we pray for that,\" Bubka said Thursday. \"We discuss with them to give them confidence and eliminate pressure from sport and situation at home. \"We tell them we love them and believe in them. 'Do what you do every time. It's your time and it's your day. We need this.' \"We want to show to everyone that Ukraine exists and is united through sport and Olympics.\" Canada breaks U.S. ice hockey hearts again . Canada piled on the agony for U.S. ice hockey fans with a 1-0 victory in the men's semifinal match at the Bolshoy Ice Dome on Friday. Exactly 24 hours after breaking the hearts of the U.S. women's team, Canada's men inflicted more misery on the Americans who, for the second successive Olympics, come off second best to their neighbors. The solitary goal came at the start of the second period -- Jamie Benn of the Dallas Stars scoring in the 22nd minute to set up a final meeting with Sweden -- who earlier maintained an unbeaten run in the competition with a 2-1 over Finland. Read more: 24 hours of pain for U.S. ice hockey fans . The Swedes, who have won all their games so far in the tournament, had to come from behind after Finland's Olli Jokinen opened the scoring in the 27th minute. But they weren't ahead for long as Loui Eriksson scored five minutes later before Erik Karlsson scored the winner in the 36th minute. The U.S. will play the Finns in the bronze medal match on Saturday. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper took the opportunity to remind President Barack Obama of the result and the bet the pair had made following a meeting in Mexico earlier in the week. Shiffrin skis into record books . U.S. teenager Mikaela Shiffrin became the youngest skier to win the Olympic slalom title, following up her 2013 world championship victory in the same discipline. The 18-year-old raced into the record books with a combined time of one minute 44.54 seconds to finish 0.53 seconds ahead of Marlies Schild of Austria. Kathrin Zettel, also of Austria, finished third. \"It is tough to describe my feelings,\" Shiffrin said. \"This has been a dream of mine for a very long time.\" Colarado-born Shiffrin showed her class under the floodlights at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. A composed first run saw her finish 0.49 seconds ahead of Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch, with Tina Maze -- seeking her third gold of the Games -- 0.67 seconds trailing in third at the halfway point. But while the Slovenian slid down the standings to eighth and Hoefl-Riesch to slipped to fourth, Shiffrin held her nerve after nearly falling on the icy surface in the second run before skiing home to take gold. \"It was a crazy moment. I was going very fast and I thought I was not going to make it, it scared me,\" Shiffrin said. Ski cross 1-2 for Canada . France's men may have swept the board in the men's event on Thursday, but it was Canada's women who were the big winners in the women's ski cross finals in the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park Friday. Marielle Thompson took the gold with Kelsey Serwa claiming silver, and Sweden's Anna Holmlund winning the bronze medal. \"It's crazy. I don't think it's even sunk in yet. I just had a big wave of emotion. I'm so so happy, especially to be up there with my teammate,\" Thompson said. \"We're all about girl power from the start. We're just having fun all day. I know Kelsey and we tried to help each other all the way down the course.\" Russian short track double . Russia claimed two of the three gold medals up for grabs in the Iceberg Skating Palace on Friday. Victor An sent the home crowd wild as he claimed gold in the 500 meters final, narrowly beating 19-year-old Dajing Wu from China with Charle Cournoyer taking the bronze for Canada. Korea picked up gold and bronze in the women's 1,000m final as Seung-Hi Park became the only female to win two short-track golds in Sochi, taking her overall Olympic medal tally to five. Park's compatriot Suk Hee Shim won the bronze with 20-year-old Kexin Fan from China taking silver. Park said she and Shim hadn't discussed tactics prior to the final. \"We didn't have any special plan since every situation is different. We just try to use teamwork and do well together. Fortunately we were able to do really well. We have been practicing the whole season together and it paid off,\" Park said. In the final short track event of these Games, Russia roused an expectant crowd with an Olympic record in the men's 5,000m relay winning time of six minutes 42.100 seconds as An claimed a sixth career Olympic gold -- a record in his discipline -- while the hosts took their gold medal tally to nine, level with the U.S. and Canada. Canada sweeps to curling double . In the Ice Cube Curling Center, Canada's men matched the gold medal-winning performance of their women 24 hours earlier with an easy 9-3 win over Great Britain in the final. Canadian skip Brad Jacobs said: \"I'm ecstatic, it's awesome, amazing. There are a million other words that can explain it, but that's all I can think of right now.\" His opposite number, David Murdoch was understandably more downbeat. \"I'm disappointed,\" Murdoch said. \"It was an opportunity of a lifetime, but it wasn't meant to be today. We did everything we could to try and start well, but we just had a poor start and that gave them a lot of confidence as well. \"Going 5-1 (after three ends) there was always going to be an uphill struggle and it didn't matter what we did in the second half.\" Earlier, Sweden's men claimed the bronze medal following a 6-4 extra-end win over China.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- On July 24, 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama addressed tens of thousands of Germans on the avenue that leads from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. In a pointed reference to the outgoing administration of President George W. Bush, he promised a new era of \"allies who will listen to each other, who will learn from each other, who will, above all, trust each other.\" One German present among the hugely enthusiastic crowd said the occasion reminded him of Berlin's famous \"Love Parade.\" No U.S. politician since John F. Kennedy had so captured Europeans' imagination. Five years on, in the words of the song, it's a case of \"After the Love Has Gone.\" The U.S. ambassador in Berlin has been summoned to the foreign ministry over reports in Der Spiegel that the U.S. National Security Administration (NSA) monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's official cellphone. His counterpart in Paris received a similar summons earlier this week after revelations in Le Monde. Merkel says Europe's trust must be repaired after U.S. spying claims . Both Der Spiegel and Le Monde used documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, lamented a \"grave breach of trust.\" One of Chancellor Merkel's closest allies, Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere told broadcaster ARD there would be consequences. \"We can't simply turn the page,\" he warned. Der Spiegel reported Thursday that Thomas Oppermann, who leads the parliamentary committee that scrutinizes Germany's intelligence services, complained that \"the NSA's monitoring activities have gotten completely out of hand, and take place beyond all democratic controls.\" In an article for the forthcoming edition of Foreign Affairs magazine, Henry Farrell and Martha Finnemore argue that it's the disclosure of such practices rather than their existence that is damaging. \"When these deeds turn out to clash with the government's public rhetoric, as they so often do, it becomes harder for U.S. allies to overlook Washington's covert behavior and easier for U.S. adversaries to justify their own,\" they write. \"The U.S. government, its friends, and its foes can no longer plausibly deny the dark side of U.S. foreign policy and will have to address it head-on,\" they argue. Among the Twitterati, #merkelphone has gained some traction, with the famous Obama motif \"Yes We Can\" finding a new interpretation. And the European media has begun to debate whether the revelations provided by Edward Snowden to The Guardian and other newspapers will do to Obama's image on the continent what the Iraq war did to that of President George W. Bush. Hyperbole perhaps, but the Obama administration is on the defensive, caught between fuller disclosure of just what the NSA has been up to and the need to protect intelligence-gathering methods. The president himself received what German officials describe as an angry call from Merkel Wednesday demanding assurances that there is no American eavesdropping on her conversations. The language out of the White House has been less than forthright, with spokesman Jay Carney saying that \"the president assured the chancellor that the United States is not monitoring, and will not monitor, the communications of the chancellor.\" His careful avoidance of the past tense has heightened suspicions in Europe that only the Snowden disclosures have forced a change of practice. Even pro-U.S. newspapers like the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung are in full throttle, writing that: \"The government in Washington has apparently not yet understood the level of damage that continues to be caused by the activities of American intelligence agencies in Europe.\" Le Monde reported that the NSA collected details of millions of phone calls made in France, and described it indignantly as \"intrusion, on a vast scale, both into the private space of French citizens as well as into the secrets of major national firms.\" Mexico to summon U.S. ambassador over spying allegations . French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault commented it was \"incredible that an allied country like the United States at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification, no justification on the basis of national defense.\" The U.S. Director of National Intelligence insisted in a curt statement that \"the allegation that the National Security Agency collected more than 70 million \"recordings of French citizens' telephone data\" is false.\" But President Obama called his French counterpart, Francois Hollande, and the White House subsequently acknowledged the allegations had raised \"legitimate questions for our friends and allies.\" The fall-out may be more than rhetorical. Germany's opposition Social Democrats are asking whether the European Union can -- or should -- agree a free trade deal with the U.S. in the current atmosphere. Negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership were already in a fragile state and will not be helped by claims in Le Monde that large French corporations such as telecom company Alcatel-Lucent have been targeted by the NSA. The European parliament has always been prickly about data-sharing with the U.S., and for years held up the U.S. Treasury's efforts to use the SWIFT interbank apparatus to keep tabs on terrorists' financial flows. The parliament this week passed a non-binding resolution calling for the agreement that was eventually reached to be suspended. And a parliamentary committee has agreed tough measures that would forbid U.S. companies providing data services in Europe to transfer the information to the U.S. without obtaining permission. The legislation must be agreed with member states, but for those hoping to get the provision deleted the wind is blowing in the wrong direction. Not unlike the WikiLeaks disclosures, reports based on the Snowden documents have caused embarrassment and friction around the world. President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil cancelled a visit to the United States after it was alleged that the NSA had intercepted her messages as well as communications from the state oil company, Petrobras, now one of the biggest players in the oil industry. Spiegel reported the U.S. had also accessed emails to and from former Mexican President Felipe CalderÃ³n while he was still in office. Obama, in his address to the U.N. General Assembly last month, tried to head off the gathering storm - saying: \"We've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.\" U.S. spy chief says reports of NSA logging French phone calls are false . And there is a hint in the U.S. response this week that, to borrow from Hamlet: \"The lady doth protest too much.\" The NSA itself has made the point that \"the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations.\" The UK and France are among governments that run their own expansive technical programs. Der Spiegel reported -- again based on Snowden's disclosures -- that the British equivalent of the NSA was involved in a cyber-attack against Belgium's state-run telecommunications company, Belgacom. The company would only say that \"the intruder had massive resources, sophisticated means and a steadfast intent to break into our network.\" The Europeans have been very grateful to share the benefits of the NSA's immense data-gathering abilities in counter-terrorism and other fields. U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks show Germany was enthusiastic in 2009 and 2010 for closer links with the NSA to develop what is known as a High Resolution Optical System (HiROS) -- a highly advanced \"constellation\" of reconnaissance satellites. One cable from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin said: \"Germany anticipates that their emergence as a world leader in overhead reconnaissance will generate interest from the USG and envisions an expansion of the intelligence relationship.\" The 9/11 attacks changed espionage beyond recognition, leading to massive investment in the U.S. in \"technical means\" -- the flagship of which is the enormous NSA data center being completed in Bluffdale, Utah. Its computing power, according to the specialist online publication govtech.com is \"equivalent to the capacity of 62 billion iPhone 5s.\" But 9/11 also shifted the balance between intelligence-gathering and civil liberties, with the U.S. federal government acquiring new powers in the fight against terrorism -- some sanctioned by Congress but others ill-defined. The technology that allows such enormous data-harvesting cannot be put back in the box, but the limits to its use pose an equally huge challenge. Ultimately, the Europeans need to collaborate with the U.S. on intelligence-gathering, to deal with international terrorism, cyber threats and organized crime. But the Snowden allegations, whether reported accurately or not, have changed the public perception and mood in Europe, obliging leaders like Merkel to take a tougher stand. At least there has been plenty of room for black humor amid the diplomatic back-and-forth. \"Earnest question: What do European leaders talk about that's worth spying on?\" asked Politico's Blake Hounshell on Twitter, while New York Times London bureau chief Steve Erlanger quipped: \"I'm not sure I'd want to listen in to Silvio Berlusconi's cellphone.\"\n\n**News 3**:\n(TIME.com) -- Peter Salk and Aseefa Zardari never met before today, but they have an odd and very significant thing in common: both of them were inoculated against polio by one of their parents. In the case of Salk, of course, it was his father Jonas, who administered his just-developed vaccine to himself, his lab workers and his family even before it was formally approved and released. Aseefa's inoculator was her mother, the late Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, assassinated in 2007. \"I have a picture of my wife immunizing our daughter 18 years ago,\" said Asif Zardari, the current president and Aseefa's father, at a United Nations gathering Saturday. \"My martyred wife told the world she dreamt of a world in which all children are free of disease.\" Father, daughter and Salk had come to the U.N. as part of a new international push to eradicate polio once and for all, and they were hardly alone. Also in attendance were U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; Afghan President Hamid Karzai; Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan; Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius; and -- significantly -- Bill Gates, head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of them and others addressed a plenary session of the U.N.'s Economic and Social Council, and all of them had a single promise: by 2015, if not earlier, polio would join smallpox as the only diseases in human history to be finally and fully snuffed out in the wild. TIME.com: Polio's back. Why now? There was an odd-seeming disconnect between the financial and institutional firepower assembled Saturday and the actual, lingering incidence of polio. In 1952, three years before the Salk vaccine was introduced, 52,000 children were paralyzed or killed in the U.S. alone. In 1988, polio was endemic in more than 120 countries, still afflicting an average of 350,000 people -- mostly children -- per year. Today, the disease is endemic in just three countries -- Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria -- and only in isolated pockets at that, an improvement due in no small part to the efforts of Rotary International, whose 34,000 chapters worldwide have spent more than $1.2 billion in the past 24 years to wipe out the disease. So far in 2012, there have been just 88 reported cases, and India, which once had a higher incidence than any country in the world, just celebrated a full polio-free year. In epidemiological terms, that ought to be enough to declare victory -- especially in a world in which 34 million people are infected with HIV and a staggering 225 million have malaria. But numbers can be dangerously misleading, and this is especially the case with polio. For one thing, only about 1 of 200 polio infections actually produce disease symptoms. The other 199 are subclinical, which means patients may have no idea they're infected, even though they can still pass on the virus -- and it's one that's exceedingly easy to pass, especially in the developing world where poor sanitation accelerates transmission. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . In 2003, polio was on the brink of extinction just as it is today, until clerics in northern Nigeria banned the vaccine claiming that it was part of a plot to infect Nigerian youth with HIV. By 2005, polio cases -- nearly all of them the Nigerian strain -- were raging across 16 countries, from Africa through India and into Oceania. \"As long as the polio virus survives,\" said Sebelius in her U.N. remarks, \"there's a risk of resurgence.\" Ensuring that it doesn't survive was the announced mission of the gathering, and that mission is being prosecuted in a lot of ways -- starting with money. Gates has committed more than $1 billion to polio vaccination efforts so far and is keeping the funding spigot open as long as necessary. Rotary Chairman Wilford Wilkinson announced another $75 million to add to the group's already huge contribution; Australia pledged another $50 million. Perhaps most important, the Islamic Development Bank has now stepped into the game, pledging $227 million to Pakistan to help close an existing funding gap until the virus is at last eradicated. TIME.com: How a ban on polio puts the entire world at risk . It's Pakistan that is currently ground zero in the polio war, not because it has the greatest number of remaining cases -- though it does -- but because the anti-polio effort has recently been politicized, just as it was in Nigeria nine years ago. In June, the Taliban blocked a planned round of vaccinations for 161,000 children, demanding that U.S. drone strikes in the country be halted first. Western vaccinators have also been newly suspect, ever since the British newspaper the Guardian revealed that CIA operatives involved in the killing of Osama bin Laden used a faux vaccine campaign in Pakistan to obtain DNA from suspected bin Laden family members, in order to determine if he was in the country at all. In July, gunmen attacked polio teams administering vaccines after the prohibition was lifted, critically wounding a Ghanaian doctor. That tragedy hung over the U.N. proceedings. Taliban's vaccine ban may affect 280,000 children . \"This is a matter of health and justice,\" Ban said in his prepared remarks. \"Where there is fighting and insecurity, I appeal to all parties to provide safe access to health workers.\" Zardari announced that government forces are mobilizing community leaders \"to understand that the polio vaccine is a blessing.\" Gates's remarks were less about geopolitics than about common sense -- fiscal and otherwise. In a conversation with TIME last week, he described a vaccination program that costs even $1 billion per year as \"a heck of a bargain\" since it avoids tens of billions of dollars in downstream treatment costs -- to say nothing of human suffering. \"I'm very focused on impact per dollar,\" he said at the U.N. \"This is one of the smartest allocations of resources the world can make.\" TIME.com: The Taliban halts the polio vaccine -- and Pakistan's kids will pay . To help the world make that investment well, he is employing satellite mapping tools to target more precisely where in often off-the-grid places vaccination teams must go. He is also arranging to equip vaccine crates with GPS tracking systems to ensure that vaccines don't wind up lost, discarded or on the black market. Ultimately, he'd like to see the techniques and infrastructure that are built to eradicate polio today put to work against malaria, measles, HIV, cholera and similar global scourges tomorrow. \"We want to leave in place a primary health care system that can be used for other diseases,\" he said. Gates sounded confident that polio could indeed be beaten and in relatively short order -- within just two or three years; Goodluck Jonathan pledged that in Nigeria at least the disease would be finished by 2015, when his term in office expires; and Alan Duncan, the U.K.'s Minister of State for International Development -- representing the world's second largest donor country after the U.S. -- delivered an open scolding to developed nations that have yet to get off their wallets and help pay for the eradication effort. \"We need to understand why some countries are reluctant to contribute,\" he said with pointed emphasis. \"India has shown the world what is possible. Other countries have got to learn from that excellent example.\" Bin Laden raid harms Pakistan polio fight . For all the new emphasis and fresh blood being brought to the anti-polio fight, it was the seniors in the crowd who spoke with the most poignancy. Sebelius recalled being a small child during that viral summer of 1952 when so many of her peers were claimed, and then, in 1955, becoming part of what was known as the Polio Pioneers -- the first schoolchildren to step forward and receive the new vaccine. In the waiting area before the event began, an elderly polio survivor moving with the aid of two walking sticks approached Peter Salk to thank him for the work his father had done -- even if it came too late to spare him the disease. In a pre-vaccine world, there was no one to blame for that victim's long-ago infection. But in ways big and small, we'll all be to blame for any infections to come. TIME Archives: Closing in on polio . This story was originally published on TIME.com. At the U.N., a vow to eradicate polio by 2015 .\n\n**News 4**:\n(CNN) -- When Haile Gebrselassie speaks people listen. The Ethiopian double Olympic gold medalist, who won the 10,000 meter title at four consecutive World Championships between 1993 and 1999, knows talent when he sees it. So when Gebrselassie labeled Nigerian sprinter Obinna Metu \"a bundle of talent who has a very bright future because he is ready to learn,\" people began to sit up and take notice. Most of all Metu himself, who as the fastest sprinter in Nigeria is determined to emulate Gebrselassie's success. \"I want people to be hearing my name, I'd love to be famous,\" Metu told CNN's Human to Hero series. \"I'm thinking of a way to develop my name and sports can help me achieve this. I want to let the whole world know that I exist.\" Father figure . Metu and Gebrselassie's paths crossed at the G4S 4Teen Program, which Metu says is \"all about helping the young athletes to develop their talent through financial back-ups.\" The pair recently spent time together in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa where they hope to inspire the next generation of athletes. But while hundreds of children watched on in awe it was Metu who was starstruck by Gebrselassie -- a man he describes as a father-like figure. \"Because of his inspirational talks I'm able to withstand the challenges on the track -- he gives me fatherly advice,\" said Metu. \"He has made me understand that to become a great person in track and field or even in sports in general, you have to train your mind to cope with pressure. \"If you cannot handle the pressure then I don't think you can have the qualities to become a champion. \"I could tell that he was able to deal with the pressure and that's why he set so many records. To have him as my mentor is a great thing and will always live in my memory.\" Bolt . While most athletes would dream of having just one mentor with the experience and success of Gebrselassie, Metu is in the enviable position of having two -- and the second one isn't too bad either. \"Usain Bolt is lovely,\" Metu said of the world's fastest man. \"He's the kind of person everyone would like to be, to be where he is. \"Because he's generous, he doesn't discriminate, he doesn't really show that he's a champion, he doesn't scare people away from him. \"He always wants people to be close to him. He plays a lot, if you're a champion or if you're not a champion, he recognizes everybody.\" Jamaica's Bolt, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, is regarded as one of the finest sprinters in history as well as one of the most charismatic athletes on the circuit. But behind his bravado and confident streak is a man who is desperate to help his fellow competitors, according to Metu. \"Usain made my stay wonderful in Jamaica,\" he said. \"Usain would always say 'Africa, come on, let's go'. He doesn't differentiate. \"He always remembers how he started. He always remembers 'hey, I was once like this guy, so I have to encourage them'. \"He really does encourage people; he encourages young people around him to keep what they know best.\" Personal best . Bolt's work with Metu has already reaped dividends with the Nigerian producing a season's best of 10.11 following his time with the Olympic 100 and 200 meter champion. The opportunity to work with sprinters and coaches outside of his own country was important to Metu, who believes the lack of top training partners in Nigeria has hampered his progress. By working in the U.S. alongside some of the biggest names in athletics such as Bolt and Yohan Blake, Metu has gained the kind of experience he could never have gained in Nigeria. \"I think training with these guys teaches you how to manage yourself in the competition,\" he added. \"It helps you realize that you shouldn't fear champions. It makes you recognize that one day I'll be like this guy. \"If you train with a champion then hopefully you'll turn out the same way. That's why it was such a great opportunity when I trained with Usain Bolt.\" New challenge . Already a champion in his own country, Metu is desperate to push the boundaries of his success and challenge the Jamaicans and Americans in the big tournaments. Racing against the same athletes within Nigeria no longer holds any appeal nor is it challenging enough -- he's the big fish in the small pond and that has to change. \"I'm the fastest man in Nigeria and everybody's looking up to me -- they want to beat Obinna Metu,\" he said. \"I'm unbeaten in the national trials for the past four years. I still need to do a lot of things to do to become a champion. My mental target is not to win national trials. \"It's no longer any news to me, I don't call it a victory. If I win I don't celebrate that much. \"I'm looking forward to winning a medal at the World Championships or at the Olympic Games. That's what I'm focusing on now.\" The opportunity to star at the Olympics began as a far fetched dream. It was during his time at school that Metu decided to pursue sprinting and attempt to follow in the footsteps of his hero, Olusoji Fasuba. Fasuba, an Olympic bronze medalist and a Commonwealth Games silver medalist, provided the inspiration for Metu, who at five years his senior had already become a household name in Nigeria. The two men came face to face at the national Olympic trials in 2008 with Metu defeating Fasuba and taking the title as Nigeria's fastest man following a thrilling 100 meter contest. It was a proud moment for Metu, who also won a bronze medal in the 200 meters at the 2007 World Championships as well as a gold medal at the All African Games in Algeria. Olympic bow . That success ensured he arrived at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing full of confidence -- finishing second in his 100m heat with a time of 10.34 seconds before recording a time of 20.62 in the 200m. Disappointment followed in the 4x100m relay -- a nightmare baton exchange led to disqualification and ended any hopes of medal success. But that failure failed to dent Metu's spirit. Competing at the Olympics in Beijing and then at London four years later remains a proud achievement -- but is by no means the most important of his life. That came when he graduated from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, with a degree in Business Management. \"My greatest achievement is that I'm an international athlete and a graduate,\" he said. \"It's something to boast of, because I don't know about Western countries, but I do know about the African mentality. \"They always see sportsmen as people who don't go to school -- as a nuisance. People used to see sportsmen and women as uneducated, people who wasted their time. \"So I am proud to say, 'OK, I'm able to combine sports and my educational career and combine them successfully'. \"Every year I'm counting my achievements. It's not as if winning national trials is the best achievement in track and field. \"They say that charity begins at home. You have to show that you are good in your own country before showing the rest of the world that you are good.\" Family man . Metu's family were certainly proud of him when he won gold medals in both the 100 and 200m at the West African University Games in Ghana. From there he moved on to the very first training camp held by the G4S 4teen Program in Kenya where under the guidance of Gebrselassie he has flourished. His success working alongside the likes of Bolt and Gebrselassie has helped Metu not just blossom as an athlete, but as a person. But there is no doubt in his own mind where the roots of his success stemmed from. \"I'm a product of my family. My family do not regret they have me in this world,\" he said. \"They say 'Ah that's my son'. My mum, brothers and sisters are all proud of me. \"They say, 'Yes Obinna, you're making us proud out there' and that's it. I think it's a great achievement for me.\" Perhaps in time he'll make Gebrselassie proud too."}

Please note that all quotes are from rush transcripts and are subject to change. If you'd like to receive a sneak peek of next week's news in your inbox every Sunday, you can sign up for the \"Political Ticker newsletter\" at http://www.cnn.com/profile/ . CNN's John King looks back at Sunday's talk shows and what will make news in the coming week. (CNN) -- And amid all the talk, there was notable silence: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided not to appear on any of the Sunday shows to defend herself after a rocky week. For Pelosi, last week included a concession that she had been briefed about the use of waterboarding back in 2003 and an accusation the CIA had deliberately misled her and Congress about Bush era interrogation practices. Health care, the economy and the path to a GOP comeback were also hot topics, not to mention the controversy over President Obama's commencement address at Notre Dame. With Speaker Pelosi declining offers from \"State of the Union\" and others to answer questions on Sunday, her Republican critics stepped into the vacuum -- with gusto. Pelosi's critics fire away . \"Lying to the Congress of the United States is a crime. And if the speaker is accusing the CIA and other intelligence officials of lying or misleading the Congress, then she should come forward with evidence and turn that over to the Justice Department so they can be prosecuted. And if that's not the case, I think she ought to apologize to our intelligence professionals around the world.\" -- House Minority Leader John Boehner on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Read more of Boehner's comments . \"I think the reality here is that Nancy Pelosi has stepped in it big time. And she is now put the Democratic Party in a position, where the question for me is, does the president support Nancy Pelosi's versions of what happened, or his CIA director's versions of what happened.\" -- Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" For all the criticism of the Democratic speaker, there was clearly little desire on the part of some Republicans to seek an investigation that might damage Pelosi but would definitely put the spotlight on Bush administration officials and the interrogations of terror suspects. \"I am less interested in investigating whether her memory is correct or she lied about it than I am in the policies that flow from the debate that we're having. I am not one who thinks we ought to have truth commissions and all of the rest of it and keep looking backward. I agree with the president. We've got enough on our plate, we need to look forward.\" -- Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, on ABC's \"This Week\" Supreme battle ahead . One certain issue for this week is the president's search for a Supreme Court nominee. Conservatives are putting pressure on leading Republicans to prepare for a confirmation fight, and while the math overwhelmingly favors the Democrats, the Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said it was too soon to rule out a filibuster, a tactic he condemned during Bush administration court debates. \"I think it is way premature ... to be predicting what kind of procedural moves will be taken when we haven't even seen the nomination yet.\" -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on \"Fox News Sunday\" Cheney: Help or hindrance? Former Vice President Dick Cheney was not out on the Sunday talk shows, but there was a lot of debate over whether he's helping or hurting the Republican Party with his harsh criticisms of the Obama administration. The criticisms have been coming hard and fast ever since his first TV interview on \"State of the Union\" on March 15. Read more about criticisms, reaction . One of his staunch defenders was his daughter: . \"The future of the Republican Party is going to be built based on substance. And a key part of that substance is a strong national defense. The national security piece of it is one on which the [former] vice president has in fact been very effective in the debate over the last two weeks. Not just in influencing public opinion but frankly influencing the Obama White House.\" -- Republican strategist Liz Cheney on \"This Week\" Read more of Liz Cheney's comments . The latest on Guantanamo . The concept of Republicans \"influencing the White House\" relates to two recent dramatic reversals of policy: refusing to release additional photos of interrogations and considering trying Guantanamo detainees in military commissions instead of civilian criminal courts. The debate on what to do with the detainees continued Sunday: . \"They should be transferred to established criminal courts, courts that have been able to handle such cases. ... We have the capacity. We have the prisons that can hold them. We have the finest system of justice in the world. Let's use it. Let's not make a new one up.\" -- ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" \"The president has a tough job to do. And I think he is beginning to learn how difficult it is to govern. You know it's one thing to campaign and to make statements. But when it comes to governing, there has to be much more pragmatic decisions. We've seen the president make several of those lately.\"  -- John Boehner on \"State of the Union\" Read more of Boehner's comments on governing . Economy: Hopeful signs? With such dreadful economic news in the past year, people will take anything they can get. \"I think what happened is the free-fall in the economy seems to have stopped. I guess the analogy [is] there are some glimmers of sun shining through the trees, but we're not out of the woods yet. We do have more work ahead.\" -- Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on \"State of the Union\" President at Notre Dame . Another big Sunday story was Obama's commencement speech at Notre Dame University -- speaking directly to those who protested his presence at the Catholic institution. \"When we open our hearts and our minds to those who may not think like we do or believe what we do -- that's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground. ... That's when we begin to say, 'Maybe we won't agree on abortion, but we can still agree that this is a heart-wrenching decision for any woman to make, with both moral and spiritual dimensions.\" -- Obama at Notre Dame University. Read more about Obama's visit . On \"State of the Union,\" two political contributors, conservative radio talk show host Bill Bennett and Democratic strategist James Carville, had very different views of this event: . Bennett: Yes, he should be welcome on the campus. Yes, he should be able to come and express his views. Should he receive an honor for his views? No, he should not. When you go against fundamental moral principles, fundamentally teachings of the church, then you should not be honored. Should there be a debate on campus on this as there can be, sure. Carville: If Notre Dame is serious ... this is what they need to do: They need to get every member of the faculty, particularly the law school -- I understand that there are law school professors teaching at Notre Dame that say Roe v. Wade is set law. ... Why don't they go through and see if their biology teacher -- see if anybody on that faculty is pro-choice? Bennett: Missing the point. Carville: I'm not missing the point. It's much more relevant to a university what a teacher is teaching in the classroom than somebody gets an honorary degree. I know people who have gotten 40 honorary degrees. That's another issue. Are you willing to have them go and make every law professor sign a statement saying that they overturn Roe v. Wade? How can you teach students that? Bennett: Free inquiry at the university is entirely appropriate. But the point of honoring someone who is the most pro-abortion president for his life and his work is inappropriate. I have one of those honorary degrees from Notre Dame, by the way. It ain't worth much. On a lighter note . Minority Leader Boehner was the butt of one of President Obama's best lines at the recent press dinner: . \"In the next 100 days, our -- my partisan outreach will be so successful that even John Boehner will consider becoming a Democrat. After all, we have a lot in common. He is a person of color. Although not a color that appears in the natural world.\" -- President Obama . Boehner took the joke about his deep tan in stride: . \"You know, as I tell my friends, you only tease the ones you love. And, you know, if the president wants to go out and take a walk with me, as I do every day, or I walked 18 holes yesterday. Last weekend I was in Ohio cutting my grass, trimming my beds, I enjoy being outside. But I'd rather be heckled than ignored.\" -- John Boehner. Read more about Boehner's response .\n\n**News 2**:\nIt may be a foregone conclusion in the minds of many that accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is guilty of murder.  A horrific crime: multiple killings, including that of a child, and more than 200 maimed or wounded. What may be less clear is Tsarnaev's role in the attack, and whether, if convicted, he will be sentenced to death. As both sides prepare for his November trial, court filings and arguments by prosecutors and the defense provide a glimpse into their opposing strategy for the penalty phase of the case. The government says it has video showing Tsarnaev placing a backpack near the finish line, then using his cell phone, moments before the first bomb went off. He walked away and the second bomb went off in front of the camera, officials say. There is also the note Tsarnaev scribbled on the boat he was hiding in, claiming the Boston Marathon victims were payback for U.S. wars in Muslim lands. Excerpts of the note open the grand jury indictment.  \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished;\" Tsarnaev wrote.  \"We Muslims are one body, you hurt one, you hurt us all;\" \"Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed;\" and \"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.\" In seeking the death penalty, prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor Tsarnaev's \"betrayal of the United States.\"  They claim that after Tsarnaev received asylum from the United States, the defendant \"enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States\" by killing and maiming its people. Leading the defense team is Judy Clarke, a longtime public defender who has represented some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski, who killed three; Jared Loughner, who shot and killed six people and critically wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords; and Susan Smith, the emotionally disturbed mother who drowned her two children. Kaczynski and Loughner pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment. In the Smith case, Clarke argued that her client's abusive childhood and depression tormented her, causing her to \"snap.\"  Although it convicted Smith of murdering her sons, the jury spared her life. \"She enjoys a wonderful reputation, she fights very hard for all her clients,\" said former U.S. attorney David Kelley, who prosecuted terrorism cases in New York's Southern District.  \"She's the model for all defense lawyers.\" Humanizing Tsarnaev is a priority for his defense team, said David Hoose, a criminal defense lawyer who represented Kristen Gilbert, a former Veterans Administration nurse convicted of killing four patients.  The jury in that case did not vote unanimously to impose the death sentence.  Gilbert was thus sentenced to life in prison. \"There's always a story to be told, \" Hoose said.  \"It's not a story that excuses or justifies what was done. but it explains and allows us to understand as human being to human being what led someone to the point in their life where they could undertake such an act that virtually everyone else finds incomprehensibly horrible.\" The defense has great leeway in presenting its case for the penalty phase.  \"The Supreme Court has held that pretty much anything related to the defense background, or character, or to the circumstances surrounding the crime\" is admissible, Hoose said. Hoose said he believes Tsarnaev, who was 19 when the crime happened, has a good chance of avoiding the death penalty. \"This is a young kid, still impressionable, only a year and a half over the minimum that he would have to be even to be eligible for the death penalty, who is clearly under the influence of an older brother who has been radicalized and who has become extremely violent.  What do you do as a younger sibling when that kind of thing is going on in your family?\" In a recent court filing, the defense lawyers sought information prosecutors obtained from the federal government's surveillance of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.  \"Any evidence tending to show that Tamerlan supplied the motivation, planning and ideology behind the Boston Marathon attack, and that his younger brother acted under his domination and control, is material,\" the defense argued. Tsarnaev's defense team declined to comment to CNN, but in a status hearing this week, they called the Tsarnaev family dynamic key to their case.  \"If the government indictment is true, this is about a family,\" defense attorney David Bruck said.  The defense objects to having an FBI agent monitor conversations between Tsarnaev and his siblings during prison visits.  Judge George O'Toole has indicated he agrees with the defense, but deferred ruling to give prosecutors time to respond. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, three people have been executed: Timothy McVeigh, for the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people; Juan Garza, for three murders connected to drug trafficking; and Louis Jones, for the kidnapping and murder of a female soldier. According to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project, juries have handed down 74 death sentence verdicts since the death penalty was reinstated.  However, a judge has formally applied the sentence only 71 times.  The disparity comes from defendants' convictions that were overturned or death verdicts that were vacated before formal sentencing by the judge. The liberal-leaning nature of Boston-area juries also will bear watching in Tsarnaev's case.  Massachusetts banned the death penalty in 1984.   Hoose said in an area that is heavily Catholic, many are inclined to follow the lead of Pope Francis, who opposes capital punishment. In a Boston Globe poll taken in September, 57% of Boston respondents supported a life sentence for Tsarnaev.  Thirty-three percent favored the death penalty. Lillian Campbell, whose granddaughter, Krystle Campbell, was killed in the marathon bombings, told CNN's Chris Cuomo, \"When they came out with this part about the death sentence ... I said, well, I don't really care what they do with them.  Because whatever they do, it's not going to bring her back,\" she said. \"I'll never forget her, ever, no matter how much they say.  Or what they do with the guy who did it. So I wouldn't wish anyone dead.  I wouldn't.\"  \"Even after what he did?\" asked Cuomo. \"Even after what he did,\" Campbell replied. Prosecutors in the case declined to speak with CNN. Former federal prosecutor Allison Burroughs said, given the nature of the crime, it's not surprising the government is seeking the death penalty.  \"If not in this case, then when?\" Burroughs said. However, she said winning a death penalty verdict in Massachusetts is so unlikely it may not be worth the time and resources involved. Others say the government made the right decision. \"The death penalty attaching to a case of terrorism where people are maimed and killed is certainly a reasonable option,\" said Gerry Leone, the former Middlesex County District Attorney who prosecuted \"shoe-bomber\" Richard Reid in 2002.  Reid pleaded guilty before going to trial. Although Leone said he thinks the defense has a chance of beating the death penalty, the prosecution strategy should be clear. \"The prosecution keeps harping on and keeps drilling home the facts. And the facts are horrible here.  Two-hundred-sixty plus people who were hurt and maimed.  Three people dead.  A police officer in the aftermath of those actions executed,\" Leone said.  \"The government will keep pounding home the facts in this case, which are just horrible from a human perspective.\" Richard Burr, who represented Timothy McVeigh, knows what it is like to lose a capital case.  McVeigh was executed in 2001. \"In any case where there is huge public injury, there's pressure on political leaders to seek the death penalty. There may be pressure on jurors to return a death penalty, even against their better wisdom.\" The key, Burr said, is to present the jurors with a detailed narrative of the defendant's life that can evoke some mercy.  \"Clarke and her team are masters at getting at a defendant's life story,\" Burr said.  Yet \"she is also attuned to the critical need for the capital defense team not to ignore the victims.\" \"The death penalty deprives people of their humanity,\" Burr added.  \"We have to try to help remind everybody that we're all in this together.\"\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- As recently as 2011, Hillary Clinton was seen by many as a respected but polarizing figure: Smart and accomplished, sure, but controlled and somewhat humorless. In the infamous faint praise of her rival-turned-boss Barack Obama, she was \"likable enough.\" Three years later, she seems somehow hipper, looser and more ... human. As we inch toward the 2016 election, she's presented a new online persona. While Clinton has embraced social media, it hasn't always loved her back, as seen most recently on her current book tour. The Internet has used every opportunity to turn her words and actions into memes, not all of them flattering. So what happened? How did Hillary Clinton suddenly go viral? You can trace the change back to October 18, 2011, when then-Secretary of State Clinton was traveling with her staff on a C-17 military plane from Malta to Tripoli, Libya. Nobody knew its importance at the time, but that's the day Reuters' Kevin Lamarque and TIME's Diana Walker snapped a handful of photos that would soon become iconic: Clinton, in oversize black shades and a no-nonsense expression, checking her BlackBerry at a makeshift desk as staffers mingled behind her. \"Okay, nice image I thought, but we were about to land in Tripoli which was certain to yield the images that the world would really want to see,\" Lamarque wrote in a blog post months later. \"Photographers, you never really know when your pictures will resurface and what use they will be to someone out there.\" 5 things to watch in Hillary Clinton town hall . Texts From Hillary . You know the rest. Six months later, the photos were all over the Internet, thanks to two journalists with an idea that started as a joke at a bar. In April 2012, Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith launched a blog, Texts From Hillary, that showed fictional text-message exchanges between Clinton, from her seat on the plane, and a range of celebrities. There she was rejecting a Mark Zuckerberg friend request, telling a flirty Ryan Gosling to call her \"Madame Secretary,\" blowing off Jon Stewart by saying she's already booked on Colbert and responding to Obama's \"Hey Hil, whatchu doing?\" with \"Running the world.\" As the perfect vessels for deadpan mockery in the social media age, the posts and related Twitter feed soon were everywhere. Within days, Clinton invited Lambe and Smith to her office at the State Department, where she initiated a group photo of the trio texting on their phones. Although its makers shuttered the blog only a week later -- \"Once you meet the subject of your meme ... it's very hard to top that,\" Smith told CNN -- Clinton's image was altered almost overnight. \"During the 2008 Democratic primary, Barack Obama had a lock on young people, technology chic and the press. Hillary was regarded by kids as the lady who'd been around a long time, wearing headbands and pantsuits,\" Maureen Dowd wrote that week in The New York Times. \"Now she's quick to laugh at herself and take advantage of the positive buzz,\" Dowd continued. Building a brand on Twitter . A few months after Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013, she joined Twitter. Her first tweet thanked Lambe and Smith for the inspiration and then said, \"I'll take it from here ... #tweetsfromhillary.\" It was retweeted more than 10,000 times. And her Twitter bio became an instant classic of the form. It reads: \"Wife, mom, lawyer, women & kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD...\" Soon Clinton was posting childhood photos of husband Bill on his birthday, tributes to the late Nelson Mandela, a portrait of her with members of Russian band Pussy Riot and pleas for such pet causes as elephant poaching and empowering women in the developing world. \"She has really embraced the platform in the right way. She has humanized herself and her brand,\" said Shama Hyder, CEO of the Marketing Zen Group. \"Today, participating in digital media isn't a choice,\" Hyder added.\"Your digital footprint is created regardless of your participation, and any smart politician knows that it is best to help curate that image vs. leaving others to define it for you.\" Clinton also has shown flashes of self-mocking humor, as when she tweeted a joke during the Super Bowl in February about how she enjoyed watching \"someone else being blitzed and sacked\" on Fox for a change. Today, Clinton, 66, has 1.5 million Twitter followers, many who may not even remember her eight years in the White House. At least for now, she seems more comfortable in her skin -- witness the photos of her wearing thick glasses and almost no makeup -- although that may change if she runs for president again. The Internet isn't always nice . But getting the attention of the Internet is not always a good thing. Anything Clinton says has the potential to go viral, for worse as well as better. In January 2013, Clinton was fighting back criticism before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing about the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,\" she said. \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.\" The Twitter-sphere quickly seized on the outburst, and within hours, #WhatDifferenceDoesItMake was trending. Not only did the hashtag spread, but so did a graphic of Clinton's 2008 campaign sign juxtaposed with the phrase \"What difference does it make?\" Earlier this month, as she promoted her new book, \"Hard Choices,\" Clinton was trending again . In an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Clinton said she and former President Bill Clinton were \"dead broke\" and \"struggled to piece together the resources\" for mortgages in pricey Washington and the New York suburbs along with their daughter Chelsea's tuition at Stanford University. Clinton sought to clarify her comment, saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled to pay off debt, but the damage was done. Her Twitter critics turned #HillaryIsSoPoor into a mocking hashtag. Once and future candidate? Criticism aside, should Clinton run for president in the 2016 election, digital-branding experts believe the reborn, tech-savvy Clinton will resonate better with voters, especially young ones. Marketing guru Marian Salzman believes the old Clinton hid her personality behind the security wall of public service. The new Clinton is undergoing a swift digital makeover, said Salzman, CEO of Havas PR North America. \"How can she modernize, and fast? Get online and exude an ageless hipster style that takes away the pain of the proximity between her age and the age of Ronald Reagan (69) when he took office,\" Salzman told CNN. \"The sudden burst of intellectual energy, even in 140 characters, reinforces she is of these times and living the now.\" Salzman believes Clinton must be her authentic self on social media to appear more relatable to voters. \"She needs humor and self awareness -- we don't want Mrs. Thatcher,\" she said, referring to the sometimes imperious former British prime minister. \"She needs to be of the people, and with them.\" It can't hurt to keep posting more personal messages such as her \"My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be!\" tweet congratulating Chelsea and husband Marc Mezvinsky on expecting their first child. Hyder, of the Marketing Zen Group, believes Clinton still wants to be president and has realized \"she can no longer sit on the sidelines\" when it comes to digital media. \"I believe it has helped her garner many new fans and will continue to play a huge role in building her brand,\" Hyder told CNN. \"The last time Ms. Clinton had presidential aspirations, there wasn't a strong sense of her as a person. The public had a very one dimensional image. \"Using digital media in this way allows her to present a fuller ... more human picture. If she does decide to run, it could be a decisive factor.\" CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.\n\n**News 4**:\nAfter days of protests and related violence, concerns are growing that furor over an anti-Islam video could intensify even more Friday -- threatening U.S. interests abroad and at home. People have taken to the streets in 10 nations and the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir, according to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, railing against \"Innocence of Muslims\" and the nation where it was produced, the United States. This outrage, and danger to Americans, could worsen in the coming days, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FBI warned Thursday in a joint intelligence bulletin. \"The risk of violence could increase both at home and abroad as the film continues to gain attention,\" the U.S. agencies said. \"Additionally, we judge that violent extremist groups in the United States could exploit anger over the film to advance their recruitment efforts.\" American tourists cautious, but undeterred . Worries about Friday, in particular, stem from the fact Muslims hold weekly prayers that day -- and may congregate afterward and march on U.S. diplomatic missions. \"We are in a full-court press at every single one of the posts in the Middle East and anywhere else there is any chance of demonstrations after Friday services to make sure nothing bad happens. And to have the security in place in case bad things do happen,\" one senior U.S. official said. The ongoing unrest centers on an obscure 14-minute film trailer that mocks Islam's prophet. Posted in July on YouTube, it got more notice recently after Egyptian television aired segments and anti-Islam activists promoted it online. Numerous questions surround the film, which includes cartoonish scenes of Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. According to a FBI/Homeland Security joint statement, the film's producer identified himself to news media as an Israeli -- an assertion Israel's government denies -- and falsely claimed the movie was financed with help from more than 100 Jewish donors. While he'd been identified in July 2011 by various names, including Sam Bassiel, federal officials now say they believe the filmmaker's name is Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. He was convicted in 2009 of bank fraud, with the indictment from the U.S. Attorney's Office listing seven aliases. A production staffer said he believed the filmmaker was a Coptic Christian who also went by the name Abenob Nakoula Bassely. Analysis: In Libya, militias 'running the show' On Tuesday, the same day people protesting the film stormed the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was attacked -- leading to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith, and security officers Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former Navy SEAL commandos. In addition to stressing there's no excuse for violence targeting U.S. diplomatic missions, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called the video \"disgusting and reprehensible\" and said it appears to aim \"to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage.\" Still, condemnations of the film and calls by leaders of largely Muslim countries not to assault U.S. diplomatic missions haven't stopped throngs from demonstrating, at times violently. Protests rage against inflammatory anti-Islam film trailer . Small and large demonstrations have occurred in recent days all around North Africa and the Middle East. While some protesters say they have not seen any of the online film, they were incensed by reports of its depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. Many of them directed their anger, too, at the U.S. government and its Israeli allies. In Cairo, for instance, a photo showed a man standing over chalk-writing, in Arabic, that read, \"Remember your black day 11 September.\" Here are details about various protests: . -- In Yemen, demonstrators breached a security wall at the U.S. Embassy as several thousand people protested outside. Four protesters died during clashes with security forces outside the embassy, according to Yemeni security officials. Twenty-four security force members were reported injured, as were 11 protesters, according to Yemen's Defense Ministry, security officials and eyewitnesses. -- In Egypt, site of one of the largest, longest-lasting protests, at least 13 civilians and six police officers were injured Thursday, according to Egyptian government officials. Throngs continued to pack the area in front of the Cairo embassy on Friday morning, as a large fire burned and security guarded the area. The instability in Egypt is a primary concern to U.S. President Barack Obama, who warned in an interview with Telemundo that it would be \"a real big problem\" if Egypt's leaders fail to protect American interests there. -- In Tunisia and Morocco, protesters massed in front of U.S. embassies. -- In Gaza City, Palestinians demonstrated outside U.N. headquarters, and about 200 Palestinians protested the film at the Palestine Legislative Council building. In one instance, Palestinian men burned a U.S. flag. -- In Tel Aviv, Israel, about 50 people demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy. -- Iranians protested near the Swiss Embassy in Tehran on Thursday. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran, since Washington and Tehran do not have diplomatic relations. Up to 500 people chanted \"Death to America!\" and called for death to the director of the movie. The Islamic Propagation Coordination Council, meanwhile, has issued a statement calling for rallies across Iran on Friday \"to protest Zionist-U.S. plots against Muslim and Islamic values,\" the state-run IRNA news agency reported. -- In Iraq, specifically in the predominantly Shiite area of eastern Baghdad known as Sadr City, hundreds of protesters hit the streets to protest the film. They chanted, \"America is the enemy of the people,\" with some burning an American flag. Other followers of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr also protested in the provinces of Najaf and Karbala. So far, the violence has not spread to Afghanistan, where there is a high potential for outrage to erupt into destabilizing chaos. Obama and his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai, have expressed their commitment to prevent that from happening. The Afghan government has ordered an indefinite block of YouTube to prevent people there from watching the clips and staging violent protests. YouTube has already restricted access to the video. Attention in the United States turns to filmmaker . U.S. officials have stepped up their criticism of the film at the center of the protests, which was privately produced in the United States. Reaction fuels debate on free speech vs. hate speech . The FBI has spoken to the elusive man behind the film within the past 24 hours, a federal law enforcement officer told CNN on Thursday. Feinstein, head of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said she believes \"an investigation is going on in this country considering the individual who did this very obnoxious ... preview to some very stupid, ... wrong-headed movie.\" Many Muslims find any depiction of Mohammed to be offensive. A Danish newspaper's publication in 2005 of Mohammed caricatures triggered riots -- and derogatory depictions of the prophet are considered by some to be worse. The production staffer on the movie said the filmmaker was a Coptic Christian who had gone to Alexandria, Egypt, where the Coptic church is based, to raise money for the film. Far from standing behind the film, the Coptic church has issued a statement calling it \"abusive\" and part of a \"malicious campaign to divide people.\" Quest for \"justice\" after U.S. ambassador's killing . Sources tracking militant Islamist groups in eastern Libya say Tuesday night's deadly attack was most likely carried out by a pro-al Qaeda group. Obama has vowed \"justice will be done.\" U.S. warships, carrying guided missiles, are on their way to the coast of Libya, and unmanned drones are being sent to help search for the killers. And a group of Marines called a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team has been deployed to Libya to help secure U.S. facilities, two U.S. officials said. About 50 Marines arrived in the country Wednesday, officials said. Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur said he is heading a high-level commission that includes heads of the North African nation's foreign, defense and interior ministries to investigate the attack. \"Our friends ... have supported us throughout these difficult times,\" he said about the U.S. government. \"We are very determined to bring things back to order.\" Romney, Obama navigate Arab world turmoil . Abushagur said at least one Libyan was arrested Thursday morning in connection to the attack, with authorities actively pursuing \"three or four\" more after examining video from the scene and talking with witnesses. The prime minister offered details on the case Thursday shortly after Libyan Deputy Interior Minister Wanis al-Sharif said \"some individuals\" suspected in the case were in custody, according to state-run LANA news agency.

Yet 10 years after his death, he's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that's long defined relations among and between Israelis and Palestinians. So, too, has the violence that's marred the region for decades. Recent incidents have stirred fears in Israel of a return to 2002, then in the midst of a second intifada, or armed uprising, when the Israeli government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks. On one day alone last week, an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a Tel Aviv street while three Israelis were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same West Bank hitchhiking post where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year. This followed several incidents in which drivers ran their vehicles into crowds on busy streets. Then came Tuesday, when two knife- and ax-wielding Palestinian cousins killed four Israelis worshiping inside a Jerusalem synagogue. 'Terror attack' at Jerusalem synagogue . So does this all mean a third intifada is coming, if it's not already here? No -- or, at least, not yet, according to experts. Much has changed, they point out, since Arafat's death. It's harder than ever to get from the West Bank into Israel, especially with explosives and such. There has been no call to arms by the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank; instead, analysts say, there has been significant cooperation with Israeli authorities to ferret out potential attackers. And there haven't been anything close yet to the coordinated, large-scale attacks in Israel like those of the early 2000s. As retired former Israeli National Security Adviser Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror pointed out last week, what's happening now \"falls far from\" the first two intifadas, as far as the overall threat to Israel. But one thing that hasn't changed is the deep frustration among Palestinians. Now, as was the case over a decade ago, many still harbor steep distrust of Israeli authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough. \"The nature of these movements is that a spark could ignite the tinder,\" said Jon B. Alterman, the head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Middle East program. \"... And once it starts moving, you have no idea where it's going to go.\" Israeli troop kill Palestinian man in West Bank clashes . Voids in Palestinian hope, leadership . Arafat is still considered a hero among many Palestinians, as the scenes around the West Bank commemorating his death November 11 showed. This was a man, according to his supporters, who stood up to Israel. This was a man who rallied Palestinians to fight. This was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent Palestinian state. Fatah cancels Arafat memorials after bombings, blames Hamas . Not only is there no more Arafat, but the idea of a unified Palestinian front is a thing of the past as well. Arafat's former group, Fatah, now controls the West Bank under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, while rival Hamas is in charge of Gaza. \"You have an unprecedented division,\" said the Brookings Institution's Khaled Elgindy, contrasting that to what he views as Israeli leadership that's become more conservative and less willing to compromise. \"It's a much weaker leadership than we've ever seen.\" The lack of a unifying figure, like Arafat, has led to a \"complete alienation of the people from leadership,\" said Ingrid Jaradat Gassner of the Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem. Not only don't they have a person to rally around, there's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many Palestinians. \"People really have no expectation, no hope, no perspective in terms of there being any chance that comes through a political initiative,\" Gassner told CNN from her home in Bethlehem. \"So what we have is an outburst of frustration.\" What there is not, however, is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against Israelis -- which was unlike, many say, what happened during the second intifada. In some ways, that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel, only the attacker may know what will happen next. \"This is a huge problem because there is no intelligence,\" Amidror told reporters on a call coordinated by the Israel Project. \"Someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying, 'Today, I'll kill some Israelis.' \"There is no organization behind it,\" the former Israeli national security adviser said, noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack. \"... I don't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual (like that).\" 2 killed, 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on Israelis . Israeli policies have an impact . What's happening and what's not happening, if you're talking about major attacks, is a testament to Israel's policies as well. A lot has changed since what Israelis called the \"Passover massacre,\" when a man walked into a seaside hotel in 2002 and blew himself up, killing 30 civilians. For one, a wall -- or a fence, depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the West Bank and Israel, making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons. Also, Israel has a renowned intelligence apparatus that's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers. This is on top of other policies, like stringent measures restricting citizens' ownership of firearms. And even as it pushes for independence, the Palestinian Authority has quietly become a working security partner with Israeli authorities. Behind the scenes, the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks, not to mention common foes from Hamas. \"The two have worked together, and it has prevented many terror attacks inside Israel,\" said the Israel Project's David Harris, predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds. \"And it has also brought much more calm.\" Yet as clashes in the West Bank last week showed, it sometimes doesn't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand. And Palestinians don't live only there and in Gaza. Many live in Israel, including some 300,000 in East Jerusalem, where there has been recent unrest centered around what Jews know as the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary. \"The fear for Israel is that the new terrorists (will be) on this side of the fence,\" said Harris. Violence, bad feelings never went away . Even then, discontent among so-called Arab Israelis is not a new thing either. In fact, experts say -- from a security situation -- Israel appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago. The measures it's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence. But according to Gassner, Palestinians' frustrations \"have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons.\" She says that many feel that Israelis -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for \"normal lives.\" \"People want to take care of their families, get their kids to school, have enough income to live off of,\" she said. \"And then the pressure just builds up. That's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration.\" Elgindy, from Brookings, said more forceful responses by Israel to attacks can backfire, reasoning, \"When you respond to violence with more repression, you're going to get more violence.\" The \"primitive assault tactics\" now being used against Israelis -- knives and cars, rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the Palestinians' storyline, especially if Israeli security forces respond \"with a heavy hand\" as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office promised after Tuesday's synagogue attack, expert Assaf Moghadam said. \"(Such tactics) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation; they can claim 'we don't have better means of disposal,'\" said Moghadam, from the Israeli-based International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. \"It's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party.\" It's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace, security and happiness to both Israelis and Palestinians -- that has some especially worried. If there's no political end in sight, what's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build? \"It's probably not going to get a lot worse, and it's almost certainly not going to get a lot better,\" said David Pollock, the director of the Washington Institute's Fikra Forum. \"The best you can say, on both sides, is, 'Well, at least we're not like Syria and Iraq.\"\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- For decades, pioneering environmentalist Stewart Brand, the founder and editor of the Whole Earth Catalog, opposed the use of nuclear power. Now he sees it as vital to efforts to combat climate change. Earlier this month, Brand made the case for nuclear power in a debate with Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson at the TED Conference in Long Beach, California. (TED is a nonprofit that took its name from the subjects of technology, information and design and is dedicated to \"Ideas worth spreading.\" It publishes talks on all subjects at http://www.ted.com/) His outspoken support for nuclear power comes as the White House has been pushing for the first new nuclear plants in the United States in three decades. Last week, President Obama announced $8.3 billion in loan guarantees for adding two nuclear reactors at an existing plant in Burke County, Georgia, near Augusta. Mark Jacobson says nuclear power is too risky . Brand says his turnabout began in 2002, when the Global Business Network, a consulting organization he co-founded, did a project on climate change for the U.S. Secretary of Defense. In an interview with CNN.com, Brand said the project showed him that the globe's climate can change abruptly: \"It goes over some tipping point and suddenly you're in a situation that you don't like and you can't go back. That got me way more concerned about climate as a clear and present danger than I had been.\" Looking for a surefire way to cut greenhouse gases, Brand said the alternative to burning coal became clear: \"We already had a very good supplier of ...electricity. It worked like mad and was as clean as it could be -- and that was nuclear. \"Looking at nuclear more closely made me look at coal more closely and I got to realizing what a horror it was across the board, and as I learned more about nuclear, I started learning all this stuff that my fellow environmentalists had been careful not to let me know about.\" Read about Bill Gates' argument for nuclear power . Brand spoke to CNN.com Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What did your fellow environmentalists get wrong about nuclear power? Stewart Brand: Well, things like, nuclear radiation is a terrible thing that we must all fear at any scale, and nuclear waste a thing that we must be horrified about, with it lasting hundreds of thousands of years and how dare we burden future generations with that. I started looking at the basic scientific and engineering lore on both those subjects. ... They are interesting engineering problems that are mostly solved already. CNN: How have they been solved? Brand: Anti-nuclear people have been saying, since Yucca Mountain [a proposed nuclear waste repository in Nevada] won't work or can't work, then you can't have nuclear. But then you think we do have nuclear, so nuclear waste must be coming out of these reactors ... so where's it going? It's going right there on the site in these dry cask storage containers where it doesn't seem to bother anybody. You can go out and look at them, stand next to them, no bad things happen. So it's already de-demonized as you see it as not this huge intractable problem. It's actually quite tractable and on a local level. And carting the stuff around is treated as such a terrible thing and \"My God, what if there's an accident?\" And you look at the videos that were made at Sandia [National Laboratory] years ago where they ran a locomotive into one of the containers, and no bad thing happened, and then they burned it in jet fuel, and no bad thing happened, dropped it from a great height, no bad thing happened. You start to realize this is actually pretty well in hand. And the rest of the story on that is the next generation of reactors, the so-called fourth-generation reactors, most of them use what we now call nuclear waste as fuel. ... So a lot of the waste issue goes away when you realize that a very good thing to do is to just park it somewhere while we think about whether we do want to stick it in the ground or use it in these fourth generation reactors. One of the things I learned is that we've already been burying nuclear waste in New Mexico at the waste isolation pilot plant for 10 years now. Works fine. It's a salt formation 3,000 foot thick -- you go half a mile down and that salt formation has been there for 250 million years. It's not going anywhere. ... It's a perfectly good place to stash this stuff if you want to get rid of it. Environmentalists will say there's no working nuclear repository anywhere in the world and you look and actually there's one being built in Finland. CNN: What about the potential for a release of radiation? Brand: The requirement is that no more than 15 millirems of radiation gets out to the public a year, and when a lady goes to get a mammogram she gets twice that. When you move from Connecticut to Colorado, the background radiation goes up five times that. And in medicine, we routinely use radioactive isotopes for a whole manner of diagnostic procedures, for x-rays and CT scans. ... Then you look at the medical studies, the epidemiology. People have been looking for human harm from radiation for a long time, ever since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And it came as a surprise to me to learn, there were no birth defects in children born to exposed parents in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When the U.N. went to study the Chernobyl area after the accident there, there were no birth defects turning up in the women who had been pregnant during that exposure. Meanwhile, some anti-nuclear organizations have been using horrifying photographs of deformed babies with gross birth defects and saying these were caused by Chernobyl. It's just a lie, so that's a little alarming to see scare tactics like that based on nonscience. Obviously you do not want to go and get close to nuclear fuel. On the other hand, when you take the fuel out of the reactor and put it in storage, 175 years, seven generations later, the radioactivity of that fuel is one billionth of what it is when you took it out of the reactors. This stuff actually has a half-life that is good. ... Mercury doesn't have a half life, when mercury gets into the system, it bioconcentrates to the point where we tell pregnant women not to eat wild fish and shellfish because the mercury has accumulated, mostly from coal burning. ... CNN: What about nuclear proliferation, the potential for spread of nuclear weapons due to greater use of nuclear power? Brand: First of all you want to separate out nations where that's a worry and where it's not a worry. China and India we really need to have stop burning coal. ... Now is there a proliferation issue there? Not really -- China and India have nuclear weapons. The figure I quoted at TED was that 21 nations have nuclear power, only seven have nuclear weapons, and in every case they got the nuclear weapons first, then the nuclear power. Sweden has nuclear power -- 40 percent of their power is from nuclear. Do we worry about them having nuclear weapons? Probably not. So then that leaves a few countries that we are concerned about. Iran is one. Venezuela would like to be one. That's where Obama's program for fuel banking, which was actually started in a very intelligent way by the Bush administration, is the classic workaround. It's a thing which lets you know basically where all the fissile material is going in the countries that join the program. ...The great thing about nuclear weapons is when you downgrade the weapons-grade uranium, you get very good nuclear fuel. That's what the U.S. has been doing for 10 years with Russian nuclear weapons. I love the symmetry of that. The very warheads that used to be targeted at American cities to blow them up are now being used to light them. CNN: Some critics of nuclear power say that it takes so long to license and build nuclear power plants it's not really a practical alternative? Brand: ...Things can be accelerated a lot. So one of the things the U.S. is doing is separately licensing -- going through the whole approval process -- reactor designs before they have to be figured out in context of a particular site. ... Then there used to be this long delay of getting site approval, but as it happened, when we slowed down and stopped our reactor building in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, most of the reactor sites already had permission for additional reactors, so that part has already been done. ... Look, you're not going to cure greenhouse gases with nuclear, but curing greenhouse gases without nuclear is approximately impossible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stewart Brand.\n\n**News 3**:\nFrench gunman Mohammed Merah, the self-styled al Qaeda jihadist accused of killing seven people, died in a hail of bullets Thursday as police moved in to end a day-long siege. He was shot in the head as he jumped out of a window with a gun in his hand, authorities say, ending a deadly episode that has shaken the nation. As a picture emerged of a man who was known to the police and had apparently sought out Islamist jihadists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, many have questioned why it took so long to track him down. The 23-year-old first struck March 11, killing a soldier in Toulouse. Another shooting in Montauban four days later left two soldiers dead, and a third attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse Monday killed four people, three of them children. Announcing Merah's death, Interior Minister Claude Gueant said a special forces expert had told him they had never seen a suspect resist with such ferocity. Merah had shown what a dangerous man he was by first telling police he would negotiate and then declaring he would resist arrest with lethal force, Gueant said. And when police finally entered his apartment, he burst out of a bathroom with guns blazing and continued shooting to the end, Gueant said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that every effort had been made to take Merah alive, but in the end, no more lives could be put at risk to achieve that. Merah still had guns, ammunition and the ingredients to make petrol bombs in his apartment when it was raided, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said, and was wearing a bulletproof vest. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said that from an al Qaeda perspective, Merah went down in a blaze of glory, still firing at special forces as he died. Police wait, negotiate with suspect . He had told police commandos late Wednesday that he wanted \"to die as a mujahedeen,\" Molins said. But Molins, who is France's counterterrorism chief, rejected the suggestion that intelligence forces had failed by not picking up the serious threat posed by Merah sooner. Merah, a French national of Algerian origin, had not followed a traditional route to radicalization or joined known Islamist networks, Molins said, actions which would have triggered closer scrutiny. Nonetheless, Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for a couple of years, having \"already committed certain infractions, some with violence,\" Gueant told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Merah spent considerable time in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the minister added. His attendance at an al Qaeda training camp there led to him being placed on the U.S. no-fly list, a U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN. On Wednesday, the interior minister told how Merah, under siege, had boasted of his actions to police through the closed door of his apartment in the southwestern city of Toulouse. \"He claims to be a jihadist and says he belongs to al Qaeda,\" Gueant said. \"He wanted to avenge the Palestinian children and take revenge on the French army because of its foreign interventions.\" Molins said then that the suspect told the officers surrounding his apartment that he had acted alone -- and that he had intended to carry out more attacks on police and a soldier Wednesday. Merah's only regret was that he was not able to kill more people, the prosecutor said, and he boasted of having brought France \"to its knees.\" Molins said Merah had initially indicated that he was not intending a suicide mission and wanted to live. But as the siege wore on, the chances of the suspect emerging alive receded. Now all attention is likely to be focused on what caused him to strike -- and whether Merah did, as he said, act alone. Investigators looking at a possible role played by his older brother, Abdelkader Merah, want more time to question him, Molins said, and are following up other leads. His mother is also being questioned. Police tracked Merah down via his mother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first shooting victim, officials said. Gueant initially told reporters it was the IP address of Merah's brother that led investigators to him. But little is known about what triggered Merah's radicalization. In one clue, Molins said Merah had told police he started reading the Quran while in prison, after presumably being exposed to more radical ideologies there. Lawyer Christian Etelin, who represented Merah in connection with previous minor offenses, said his client went to Afghanistan two years ago. He had become suddenly radicalized, Etelin told BFM-TV, and wanted to become more involved politically. Etelin last saw Merah, whom he described as having a \"complex\" personality, on February 24, when he appeared in court accused of driving without a license and causing an accident with injuries. Merah was sentenced to a month in prison and was to appear before the judge again in early April to determine where he would serve that sentence, the attorney said. Killings focus fears on 'solo' acts of terror . But a series of clues, some relating to a scooter used in the attacks, instead led investigators late Tuesday night to the apartment in Toulouse where Merah holed up under siege, armed and dangerous. The shootings had already revealed a ruthless and determined killer. All seven victims were shot in the head, most at point-blank range, and authorities said they were carefully targeted because of their religious and ethnic ties. The gunman's first victims were three soldiers of North African origin who had recently returned from Afghanistan, who were shot dead in two incidents. Days later, the killer struck again, killing a rabbi and three children at the Jewish school Monday. More details of how Merah planned and executed the attacks are likely to emerge in the coming days. Videos he took of the attacks, seen by police, suggests a cold-blooded brutality. \"Allahu Akbar,\" (God is great) he says as he guns down the two soldiers in Montauban. Merah said he had posted the video online, but police do not yet know where, Molins said. Merah claimed to have trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan's Waziristan region, bordering Afghanistan, Molins said. He was sent back from Afghanistan to France after being picked up at a traffic stop by Afghan police who reported his presence to international forces, the prosecutor said. The French defense ministry said Merah had twice tried to join the country's armed forces. The first time, in the northern city of Lille, he was turned down because of his prior convictions. The second time, in July 2010, he attempted to sign up for the Foreign Legion in Toulouse, but left during the first round of testing, the ministry said. Although his neighbors describe him as having been a quiet man, at home Merah had watched violent jihadist videos online, including footage of decapitations, Molins said. He was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, the prosecutor added. Police have questioned other family members in Toulouse, including his mother, Zoulika Aziri, Molins said. Mohammed Merah was born in Toulouse in October 1988, according to Elisabeth Allanic, magistrate at the prosecutor's office in Paris, and at one time he worked in a garage in a Toulouse suburb. He grew up in a northern suburb of city called Les Izards, which lawyer Etelin described as an area with some drug-related activity. Etelin told BFM-TV he had represented Merah since 2004 or 2005, when his client was a minor, mostly over accusations of theft. He said Merah had been \"polite and courteous\" and had shown no signs then of a tendency toward radicalization. That might have changed after his trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan, but Etelin said he didn't notice a big difference. \"I knew he was politically active but he never spoke to me about this. He didn't want to talk about this,\" Etelin said. \"He was very discreet on this. But I never had the impression that he was an individual radically different from the one I knew in the beginning. I always knew him as being someone very flexible in his behavior, courteous, polite, soft and certainly not rigid to the point of being led by a certain fanaticism.\" Etelin said that before the alleged murders, he had mainly been in contact with Merah's older sister, who, along with their mother, had been \"exasperated\" with Merah's minor crimes. \"It was not possible to see him being serious,\" the sister had said, according to Etelin.\n\n**News 4**:\nOn their own, they're simple household items. Pressure cookers. Nails. Nylon bags. But combine them with explosives, and you can get the kind of bombs that investigators now suspect were used to turn the finish line of the Boston Marathon into a bloody nightmare. Scraps of them found at the scene of the twin bombings are being sent to the FBI's national laboratory, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices, the federal agent leading the investigation said Tuesday. Meanwhile, investigators combed through a digital mountain of photos and video clips and asked the public for help finding who planted them at two points on Boylston Street. \"Someone knows who did this,\" said Rick DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office. \"Cooperation from the community will play a crucial role in this investigation.\" DesLauriers asked people to report anyone who talked about targeting Monday's race or showed interest in explosives. He urged anyone who might have heard the sounds of explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or saw someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around Monday to come forward. 'Boston will overcome,' mayor vows . There has been no claim of responsibility, DesLauriers said. \"The range of suspects and motives remains wide open,\" he said. The U.S. government has warned federal agencies in the past that pressure cookers -- airtight pots used to quickly cook or preserve foods -- have been packed with explosives and shrapnel and detonated with blasting camps. A law enforcement official said Monday's bombs were likely detonated by timers. Photos obtained by CNN showed the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. A federal law enforcement source told CNN the photos were included in a bulletin sent to federal law enforcement agencies. The pieces recovered so far suggest the devices, which were identical, could carry 6 liters (1.5 gallons) of liquid apiece, a Boston law enforcement source said. The parts found include a partial circuit board, which would be used to detonate a device. 'Very effective' bombs . Pressure cooker bombs can be \"very effective,\" terrorism expert Jeff Beatty told CNN.  Taliban and al Qaeda militants \"use them to make their IEDs,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean it was the Taliban -- other people can read about this,\" said Beatty, who served in the FBI, CIA and the military's Delta Force. But so far, investigators have found no foreign or al Qaeda connection to the bombings, a U.S. official told CNN. And Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters in Washington that some of the facts suggest the carnage had its roots in American soil. \"There are a lot of things that are surrounding this that would give an indication that it may have been a domestic terrorist, but that just can't be assumed,\" Chambliss said. We've been hit before on home soil . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the bombings don't appear to be harbingers of \"a broader plot.\" But she urged Americans \"to remain vigilant and immediately report any signs of suspicious activity to local law enforcement officials.\" And members of Congress who were briefed by Obama administration officials on told reporters that the field of possible suspects remains wide open. \"We really don't know if it's a foreign or domestic threat,\" said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Commitee. \"We don't know whether this was a homegrown terrorist or part of a wider conspiracy.\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper held closed-door talks with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Chambliss,R-Georgia, told reporters afterward that \"there's not a whole lot of update to give.\" What we know about the bombings so far . \"This is a very fluid investigation. The FBI's in the lead, and I personally know the special agent in charge. He's one of the best,\" Chambliss said. Late Monday, authorities searched the apartment of a young Saudi man who was among the wounded at the race.  He was found to have no connection to the attack. \"He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time,\" the U.S. official said. A Saudi woman, a medical student who was also injured in the blast, has also been interviewed by investigators, according to a law enforcement source. Boston's 'most complex crime scene' ever . Investigators are combing what Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis called \"the most complex crime scene that we've dealt with in the history of our department.\" The cordoned off area has been reduced from 15 blocks to 12 and will be reduced further in coming days, he said. Even the smallest bits of debris could help indicate the bombs' \"signature,\" said a federal law enforcement official who works in the intelligence community. The explosives themselves were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material -- suggesting the packages used in the attack were crude devices. How you can help . Based on the bombs' effects, the devices could have been small enough to be concealed in small bags or boxes, a law enforcement official said.  The smoke was consistent with a \"low-velocity improvised explosive mixture, perhaps flash powder or sugar chlorate mixture,\" the official said. Two photos obtained by CNN affiliate WHDH might raise more questions. The first shows a light-colored bag sitting on the ground next to a mailbox. The second -- of the same spot -- shows a blast seemingly where that bag sat, with the mailbox still upright. Investigators have not commented on these photos, which WHDH reports it has shared with authorities. When the pieces that have been recovered are sent to the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, investigators will try to better understand how they worked and look for clues like fingerprints, DNA or serial numbers to help track who planted them, the Boston law enforcement source said. Authorities haven't given any timetable as to when they expect significantly new details. But DesLauriers vowed Tuesday that the more than 1,000 law enforcement officers from more than 30 agencies will get results, even if they have to go \"to the ends of the Earth\" to get them. \"Our mission is clear: to bring to justice those responsible,\" he said. \"The American public wants answers. The citizens of the city of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts want and deserve answers.\" Boston heroes: Running to help . Authorities have begun to search through huge amounts of video and images from surveillance cameras in the area near the attack.  So far, no footage has been spotted showing someone placing the bombs, a law enforcement source said. Authorities have asked anyone with images from any part of the marathon to share them with police. \"People don't know that they were witnesses -- that they might actually have evidence in their phones or in their cameras,\" Juliette Kayyem, President Obama's former assistant secretary for homeland security, said on CNN's \"Starting Point.\" Davis vowed authorities will sift \"through every frame of every video.\" The FBI is likely issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around Copley Square at the time of the blasts, according to a federal law enforcement official. Doctors believe bombs contained sharp objects . Two doctors overseeing treatment of the injured believe the explosive devices contained nails or similar objects. Many patients have severe wounds \"related to the blast effect of the bomb as well as small metallic fragments that entered their body,\" including \"pellets\" and \"nail-like objects,\" said Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital. A variety of sharp objects were found inside the patients' bodies, he said, adding that the bombs probably contained multiple metallic fragments. Asked whether what was found in the patients' bodies could have come from nearby objects that exploded in the blast, Velmahos said he believes the materials were likely part of the explosive devices. Map of the explosion sites . Ron Walls, chair of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said most patients there were wounded by \"ordinary debris.\"  But three were injured by \"perfectly round objects\" that were \"very uniform, consistent, metallic,\" he said.  And another patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails. \"There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" Wall said. No unexploded bombs . Suspicious packages that were detonated out of precaution after the bombings turned out not to be explosive devices after all. After the blasts Monday, some officials reported that explosive devices that failed to go off were found. But investigators said Tuesday the only bombs were the two that exploded at the marathon. The intelligence community is poring through all threat reporting for any clues, U.S. counterterrorism officials told CNN. That includes any claims made on jihadist websites. Nothing is being dismissed this early on, the officials said. Bombing is the latest Patriots Day tragedy ."}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7521, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- I was stunned. We were deep into the fall semester at the University of North Carolina journalism school, where I taught feature writing. I was showing the students an example of a travel article, one I had written for The New York Times about Plymouth, Massachusetts. I read a few paragraphs from the opening scene, with U.S. 44 winding through cranberry bogs, a billboard coming into view with images of Gov. William Bradford and Elder Brewster, the greeting in boldface letters: Welcome to Plymouth -- America's Hometown, and a black Pilgrim hat that conjured up memories of all those Thanksgiving pageants in grade school when Priscilla said: \"Speak for yourself, John.\" A student in the second row said, \"Who's John? And ... this Priscilla?\" A student in front of her said, \"I've never heard of these people.\" That's when a young woman in the front row said, \"Yeah, I kept wondering, who are these dudes?\" I felt sheer incredulity now. \"Capt. Myles Standish?!\" The no was in the silence. A silence that morphed into sympathy. They hadn't meant to make me feel so bad. A student at the other end of the second row squinted in deep thought, admitting that Myles Standish sort of rang a bell. \"Wasn't he the captain of the ship?\" I didn't know you could get through grade school without those Thanksgiving pageants and the Priscilla-John Alden-Myles Standish triangle immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Nor did I think you could get through the American history courses that follow or become a student at one of the top public universities in the land without encountering those names. Or Gov. William Bradford. Or Elder Brewster. Publishers of textbooks have pretty much dropped the Pilgrims. Maybe they are sensitive to separation of church and state, or don't want to jeopardize their sales to schools and school boards. It's true, too, that lots of more recent history has had to be added to textbooks, for World War II and the Cold War, not to mention Vietnam, the space race, the civil rights movement and the too many assassinations and assassination attempts. That leaves little or no room for the Pilgrims and what they did. But I say no more. Opinion: Some uncomfortable truths about Thanksgiving . No more forgetting, casting Priscilla and John Alden, Capt. Myles Standish, Bradford and Elder Brewster aside -- left in the ditch of history. Let's hear it for the Pilgrims! I say this not for personal reasons -- I am a member of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants -- but because their story is an important part of this country's history. When they boarded the Mayflower in Plymouth, England, in 1620, it was not because they didn't have anything better to do. They did not sail across the Atlantic, still a great unknown, simply to see what was on the other side. They came aboard the ship -- a very small ship for such a big ocean, all the more evident if you have stepped aboard the replica Mayflower II -- and sailed west because they had a deep and abiding desire to worship their God as they saw fit. There were 102 of them. The Pilgrims did not occupy passenger cabins, however small those cabins might have been back then. They were considered the cargo for the voyage, and so crossed in the cargo space, the deck -- a dark deck -- below the crew's quarters. Halfway across, the ship was damaged by a bad storm. In another storm, John Howland was swept off the deck of the ship into the ocean; he managed to grab a rope and was pulled back on deck. Oceanus Hopkins was born at sea. Peregrine White was born after they reached Cape Cod. The Mayflower dropped anchor in Provincetown Harbor on November 22, 1620. (Some historians give the date as November 11.) Later that day 41 men gathered in a cabin to draw up the rules of governance for their colony -- a document that has come to be known as the Mayflower Compact. Those 41 men then affixed their signatures to one of the great liberty documents of history. It would become the keystone for the U.S. Constitution. It took almost a month for the search party to find a suitable place for their settlement, but they finally found it: an abandoned Wampanoag village with a plentiful water supply, good harbor, cleared fields and a hill on which to build a fort for protection. The Mayflower pulled up anchor in Provincetown Harbor and dropped anchor in Plymouth Harbor December 21. The dead of winter. No Holiday Inn. Just cold, bleak shoreline, with only the trees and hills to offer shelter. The first passengers went ashore December 21 -- whether on Plymouth Rock is subject to debate. Richard Pickering, deputy executive director of Plimoth Plantation, points out that, as the naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison has noted, men in boats tend to avoid big rocks. Whatever the truth of the landing, the captain of the Mayflower did not simply put the Pilgrims ashore and return to England. Capt. Christopher Jones -- not Standish -- kept the ship in the harbor so the men could go ashore each day to build homes -- simple, one-room cottages the size of suburban garden sheds today -- then return to the safety of the ship. For future safety, a large gun was mounted on a platform atop the hill that overlooked the harbor. But the enemy that first winter was the \"general sickness,\" the near plague of colds, coughs and fevers. \"Because only five to seven men were well enough to tend the sick and bury the dead,\" Pickering said, \"a common burial was used.\" In mid-March 1621, as the sickness was abating, Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag tribe, appeared and befriended them. Squanto, who had been captured by English sailors and lived briefly in London, showed them how to plant corn. Come spring, when Jones prepared to set sail for the return voyage -- a voyage delayed by the loss of members of his crew to the \"general sickness\" that had claimed so many of his passengers -- he invited any of the Pilgrims who wished to do so, to return. Half of them had died. Yet not one single one went. \"By the standards of that day or by the amphibious doctrine of any day,\" historian Morison wrote, \"the leaders of Plymouth Colony took incommensurate risks, yet they came through marvelously well. They attributed that success to Almighty God .... But the Lord helps those who help themselves, and these people were valiant in the face of danger, resourceful in difficulties, and possessed of an innate common sense, not only in dealing with the fools and rascals among themselves but with the enemy on our coasts, the American Indian.\" The following autumn, to give thanks for the bounty of their crops and well-being, the Pilgrims -- 16 men, four women, 23 children and nine hired seamen or servants -- held a harvest festival. The record shows that the bounty included wild fowl, codfish, bass and \"a great store of wild turkeys.\" Massasoit, the chief, arrived with 90 of his men to be \"entertained and feasted\" in a three-day celebration of the harvest. \"During the course of the event,\" Pickering said, \"they went out and killed five deer, which they presented ceremonially to the men they perceived as the important men in the colony -- an honorific gift.\" Our Thanksgiving has its roots in that gathering, though -- the wish to give thanks and the gathering to eat. As does Thanksgiving dinner. Cranberries, a native berry the Indians introduced them to, apparently got their name from the Pilgrims. The stem so resembled a crane they called them \"crane-berries,\" shortened over the years to cranberries. And pumpkins were such a staple the Pilgrims had a verse: . We have pumpkins at morning, and pumpkins at noon . If it were not for pumpkins, we should soon be undone. Thanksgiving by the numbers . So, welcome your family -- or make the trip \"to grandmother's house\" -- enjoy the Thanksgiving football games, carve the turkey, add the dollop of cranberry sauce, save room for the pumpkin pie ... and remember the Pilgrims. As I hope the students in my class do too, now, with their families and possibly their children.\n\n**News 2**:\nFast cars, fast women and fast on their way to court -- it would seem some footballers are renowned as much for their pace on the pitch as for flouting the rules when it comes to the need to speed. New Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini might be known as the engineer, but he will want to put the brakes on his players getting behind the wheel. Carlos Tevez, who completed his move from City to Juventus last week, was just one player to feel the force of the law after being found guilty of committing motoring offenses. In April of this year, the Argentine was fined about $1,500 and told to carry out 250 hours of community service after being found guilty of driving while disqualified and without insurance. Tevez's former teammate, Samir Nasri, was also banned from driving for six months and fined $3,180 after being caught on camera exceeding the speed limit three times in 2011. Defender Micah Richards became the third Manchester City defender to be banned when his license was suspended for six months after failing to respond to two speeding notices. And it's not just the Manchester City car pool that has had problems with that thirst for speed. Benzema . In February, Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema car was clocked on a Madrid highway driving at 216 kilometers per hour -- more than double the legal limit. The Frenchman, who was driving an Audi, which is the official car sponsor of Real, was banned for eight months and fined nearly $23,000. It came after a June 2011 incident where Benzema was fined for racing in downtown Ibiza. In April, Swansea City's Kemy Agustien was banned from driving for 12 months after clocking up 39 penalty points -- 27 more than the usual limit of 12 that would get a player banned. Car sponsors are an essential aspect of the football industry but given the place footballers occupy in the hearts and minds -- and more importantly the wallets -- of the sport's paying customers it's unlikely that relationship will be ending anytime soon. \"Football is the sport that cuts through to by far the largest number of people around the world,\" a spokeswoman for Audi, which runs sponsorship deals with Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Manchester United, told CNN. \"Our experience based on our commitments with the top class European clubs tells us that there is major business potential for Audi within this sporting environment, both on a business-to-business footing and with consumers, i.e. the fans. \"Together with the teams we are conducting international activities not only in Europe but also in Asia.\" Big business . It is not difficult to understand why Audi has forged such a close relationship with a number of leading teams in Europe. \"The best example of this 'internationalization' is the Audi Cup, which has been a resounding success both in terms of quantity and quality,\" added the Audi spokeswoman. \"The 2011 competition was staged in Munich, and was broadcast in 180 countries, achieving more than one billion exposures during the pre-event and post-event coverage period.\" While the commercial gains are obvious, the company was also keen to point out that it would take \"necessary constructive action\" if players were found guilty of breaking motoring rules. \"Audi has sponsorship agreements with various associations and teams,\" added the spokeswoman. \"Many of these agreements also contain clauses concerning the provision of Audi vehicles. \"Of course, we work on the basis that all the drivers of these Audi vehicles will comply with existing traffic regulations. \"If this proves not to be the case, it is the responsibility of the association or team management to take the necessary corrective action.\" Aura of invincibility? But it is not always easy to comply with existing traffic regulations when you have an \"aura of untouchability.\" \"Players have absorbed this and, as if by osmosis, have begun to believe they are above reproach,\" Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University in the English Midlands, told CNN. \"Every day, they are surrounded by evidence of their immaculate status, whether in the media, or in restaurants and bars, or even just when they turn up for training where there's usually an assembly of adoring fans and obsequious journalists. \"Footballers are only doing what the likes of you, me and other consumers do all the time -- buy products that confer value on them. \"Fans buy trainers, shirts, or dogs. (yes, dogs are commodities nowadays), other people buy designer clothes, homes in desirable areas and, of course, cars.\" When it comes to vehicles, added Cashmore: \"Footballers buy even more expensive cars, which tend to be faster, so tickets for speeding and parking are, in practical terms, irrelevant. \"We are all part of the same process -- buying visible status. The difference is that footballers can afford more and want their status to be not just visible but ostentatiously visible.\" It's not just players either -- managers have also been in trouble, with Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson famously being absolved of any wrongdoing in October 1999 after claiming he had severe diarrhoea and needed to reach a toilet after speeding down the highway. Beckham . David Beckham was another to escape after winning an appeal against his eight-month driving ban in December 1999. Beckham claimed he was trying to escape a paparazzi photographer when his Ferrari was clocked at 122 km/h in an 80 km/h zone. According to the judge, there were \"special circumstances\" which had caused Beckham to break the speed limit. Both Ferguson and Beckham were represented by attorney Nick Freeman, a man who has been nicknamed \"Mr Loophole\" after successfully getting his clients off the hook. Freeman has represented golfer Colin Montgomerie, singer Van Morrison and countless other celebrities during his time working in the business. But other football stars haven't been so lucky: . The likes of Rio Ferdinand and Jermain Defoe have also felt the force of the authorities, with both men being handed bans from driving. And Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo survived a high-speed crash in January 2011 after smashing his $303,000 Ferrari against a Manchester tunnel when he was playing for United. Balotelli . And then there's that man, Mario \"Why always me?\" Balotelli, who crashed his Bentley last April in a collision with another car. Balotelli, who now plays in Italy with Milan, paid out nearly $15,000 in parking fines and had his white Maserati impounded just the 27 times during his spell at City. And while car sponsors continue to queue up to sign marketing deals with football clubs, others within the motor industry remain concerned about the impact players flouting the law has. \"It doesn't help having someone who can have cars at the higher end of the market who is ignoring the law,\" Damien Smith, editor of Motor Sport Magazine, told CNN. \"I was surprised that Tevez wasn't given a custodial sentence and the judge didn't make an example of him.\" Smith adds, however, that it's not a new phenomenon; footballers and cars have had this relationship going back to the 1970s. \"Footballer players are very rich young men who have a penchant for buying nice shiny cars and have a reputation for buying the most expensive. They're high powered and high performance cars and there will be occasions when they go too fast.\" Unfortunately, it's unlikely that footballers are about to change their way. According to a survey taken in February 2011 by British insurance firm Elephant, professional football players \"are the drivers most likely to have points on their driving license for committing offenses such as speeding, running red lights and using a phone whilst driving.\" After consulting data from more than over three million motorists in the UK, research showed that almost a third of football players have points on their license. Temptation . Elephant.co.uk managing director, Brian Martin, said at the time, \"Powerful cars are closely associated with the footballers' lifestyle so perhaps for some of them the temptation to speed is simply too much.\" With wages at the top level still rising and punishments such as that handed out to Tevez unlikely to act as a deterrent, life in the fast lane looks set to continue for a while longer. But perhaps a sobering thought might give some football players a reason to pause and think. Courtney Meppen-Walter had the world at his feet after joining Manchester City. Now, at the age of 18, he is serving a 16-month sentence after being found guilty of causing the deaths of two people in a car crash. He admitted to causing their death by careless driving and was banned from driving for three years. Footballers may have a need for speed -- but the speed of thought might be more useful next time they consider flouting the law.\n\n**News 3**:\nRay Duggan will be the first to tell you just how tough he was. Raised to never run from a fight, Duggan started running with a gang at 14. With his father in prison and absent from his life, the gang was everything to Duggan. \"It gave me a sense of being,\" said Duggan, now 31. Running with the Young Bloods in the West End neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, Duggan says he felt the need to prove himself. \"I had to make myself meaner and tougher,\" he said. He got his first gun at 16 and admits \"shooting people and running away from the police\" were his adrenaline. Duggan thought he might one day get shot and killed. He never expected to get shot and paralyzed. What happens when you don't die? It was around midnight on October 9, 2004, when Duggan returned home after a car chase with rival gang members. Thinking he'd lost them, he was outside chatting with a friend when two men walked by. He thought they were neighbors until they opened fire. Duggan was hit with a barrage of bullets, one severing his spinal cord. \"It never entered my head about being paralyzed or anything,\" Duggan said recently as he maneuvered his wheelchair down the street, pointing to the corner where he was shot. \"It was right there. That's where I ended up getting shot ... I fell into the street right here,\" he said. For Joel Irizarry, a former gang member from Chicago's northwest side, the memory of the moment he was shot is just as clear. On May 6, 1998, from the driver's window of his car, Irizarry watched a rival step out of an alley, raise his pistol and fire a single shot. The bullet went through the seat and hit Irizarry in the spine, he said. He was instantly paralyzed. One bullet was all it took. When doctors told Irizarry he'd never walk again, his whole world shattered. Before that moment, he thought he was invincible. A double life . Irizarry says he joined a gang for protection. He was a skinny, scared 15-year-old in a neighborhood where there were shootings nearly every day. He couldn't get to school without being harassed, chased, or beaten up, he said. After joining the gang, Irizarry felt he was leading a double life. He maintained a good GPA at school, and at home he was a caring son and a good brother for his younger siblings, Irizarry said. But out on the streets, he said, \"I made less than favorable decisions.\" Irizarry said he was trying to leave the gang when he was shot. Whether it's drug dealing or gang activities, the outcomes you hear about are always the same, Irizarry said. \"You only hear about death or jail. You never hear about this disability,\" he said. Lifelong disability and health care . For Irizarry and Duggan, permanent disability and lifetime health care are their new reality. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, acts of violence, primarily gunshot wounds, are the third leading cause of spinal cord injury among American adults.  Experts say young, uninsured men are affected disproportionately. The cost to society is huge. Health care can cost up to a $1 million per patient in the first year alone, and up to $181,000 for each year after that. Dr. Roy Adair, head of rehabilitation at Chicago's Advocate Christ Medical Center, says nearly half of all spinal cord injuries that come through the hospital's trauma unit are the result of gunshot wounds. \"Imagine being fully independent, get a gunshot wound and all of a sudden you're paralyzed, you can't work, you can't take care of bodily functions ... That's what we're dealing with,\" Adair said. Everyday tasks are beyond challenging. For Duggan, just going to the bathroom is difficult. \"It really humbles you,\" he said. And being intimate with another person? \"That scares the hell out of me,\" he said. \"I have very, very low self-esteem.\" Duggan lives on his own in a small house that is barely wheelchair accessible. Still, he insists on doing most things himself. \"Just because I'm in a wheelchair,\" he said, \"if I don't do something and have to ask someone else, it's like giving up.\" His biggest health threat, he says, is the bedsores he gets from being in his chair.  When we visited Duggan, he had just come home from the hospital after one of his bedsores became infected. Duggan underwent several surgeries; part of his hip bone had to be removed. Dr. James Doherty, director of the trauma center at Chicago's Advocate Christ Medical Center, said the majority of the patients his center treats survive their injuries but are left with long-term disabilities. A high price to pay . Duggan no longer looks at the medical bills that come. He knows he cannot afford the cost of his care. In the first year of his recovery, Duggan estimates, he had more $1 million in health care bills that were passed on to taxpayers. The ongoing cost of hospital stays for bedsores, he says, is about $40,000 a year. \"There is a financial cost for those injured in gun violence,\" said Rebecca Levin, director of the Injury Prevention & Research Center at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. Because victims are \"disproportionately young and uninsured,\" she said, \"the cost is borne by the rest of us.\" Irizarry was 17 and uninsured when he got shot. He feels those paralyzed by gun violence are forgotten victims. \"Every once in a while you'll see or hear something in the news about the aftermath, but not enough,\" he said. Irizarry believes if people were more aware of the cost to society, more might be done to find solutions to the violence. \"Everybody is a victim of their circumstances. ... Whether it's bad role models or just poverty, the help is not there that we need,\" he said. The bystander . Michael Brown, 56, was an innocent bystander when a bullet struck him while he was driving in a Chicago suburb on May 3 of this year. \"All of a sudden a big boom, big sound and then pain like a big punch through my left shoulder, and I lost control from my neck down,\" Brown said. Gun violence, unfortunately, is nothing new to Brown. At age 7, he says, he was playing outside his house in the suburbs just south of Chicago when a bullet pierced his upper thigh. He survived that -- and he survived being shot again this time. But the most recent bullet has left Brown a quadriplegic. These costly, life-changing injuries affect not only those caught up in street wars, but also those who have nothing at all to do with the violence. Brown is a pastor, a high school math teacher and a father who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. \"You know, I don't hold any bitterness or anger. I just want the violence to stop,\" he said, as a tear rolled down his cheek. From gang war to peace . Duggan and Irizarry take full responsibility for their situations and acknowledge their role in the violence. But today, both are working to fight violence on the streets of their respective cities. Duggan works at the Institute for the Study & Practice of Nonviolence in Providence. That job -- and the people he meets through it -- give him reason, he says, to go on. \"I can give up, just sit on disability and just not do nothing with my life and stay home and just freakin' fade away,\" said Duggan. \"I'd much rather do something, and this is why I do the work I do now.\" \"As long as I stop one kid from going down the wrong path, then -- bang -- I already saved a life,\" he said. Irizarry mentored young men who were making mistakes similar to those he made and helped those with spinal cord injuries.  He just graduated with a master's degree in social work, and he's working full-time as an admission coordinator at Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital in Chicago until he gets his license to practice social work. \"They say everything happens for a reason. This might be my reason. Just so I can prevent somebody from following my same road,\"  he said. Blame weak gun laws for holiday violence, Chicago's top cop says .

A trip to Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix will cost even the most discerning fans thousands of dollars, while providing a hefty windfall for business owners riding one of the biggest consumer spending weekends of the year in the U.S. Victoria's Secret models hosting $25,000 tables, shady ticket deals, and risky online trading for Super Bowl seats have become as much a part of the annual celebration of America's favorite sport as the ceremonial opening coin toss. With so much at stake, many fans won't be leaving anything to chance in the race to book luxury hotels, limos, and some of the year's most lavish parties -- not to mention, tickets to the big game itself. As a result, a throwback solution from pre-Internet days has emerged as a winner: the hospitality package deal. \"It's a value-add situation,\" says Anbritt Stengele, owner of Chicago-based Sports Traveler, who sold out of her few remaining Super Bowl packages last Friday. \"Hotels are just not available,\" she says, explaining that there is extra demand for four and five-star accommodation over the weekend because of the Phoenix Open, a four-day PGA tournament featuring Tiger Woods, which concludes on Super Bowl Sunday. For Sports Traveler clients, drinking can start as early as at 11.30 a.m. on game day with a \"Touchdown Club Tailgate Party\" that includes an open bar and buffet that lasts until kickoff at 3.30 p.m. Understandably, a premium is placed on hassle-free transportation from the resorts of Scottsdale to the University of Phoenix Stadium, a 40-minute drive away. \"People want to have some fun; they don't want to be the designated driver,\" she explains. \"They just want the whole thing taken care of and guaranteed. Yes you can do it yourself, but a lot of people choose not to.\" Working her 15th Super Bowl since starting her company as a student at Saint Xavier University in Chicago, Stengele reserves blocks of hotel rooms in Super Bowl cities 12 months in advance. She has already launched her search for rooms in San Francisco, in preparation for Super Bowl 50, to be played in nearby Santa Clara. Providing that scarce availability, along with a game ticket, provides an advantage over hotel booking sites, she says. At this late stage, the basic package deals left on ticketing site SBTickets.com begin at $6,000 for one 'Upper Level End Zone' (i.e. nosebleed) Super Bowl ticket, four nights at a three-star hotel, game day shuttles, and pre-game festivities. The quote is per person based on a double occupancy room. Singles start at $7,000 and airfare is not included. The cheapest Super Bowl \"get-in\" price on ticket aggregator SeatGeek at the time of writing stands at $3,507, valuing the add-ons and convenience of a package deal at $2,493 per person. Seventy percent of Sports Traveler's clients are corporates, many of whom have asked for golf tee times and PGA tickets to be lumped onto their deals. The remaining batch encompasses 'bucket listers' looking to attend any Super Bowl, international fans (mainly Australians), and of course, rabid Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots supporters who waited to see whether their teams would qualify (only the highest spending season ticket holders are allotted seats to the big game). Then there are the partiers; lots of them. The concept of staging bachelor party-themed events leading up to the Super Bowl began over 10 years ago and has taken on a new realm of competition. Each year, the likes of Rolling Stone, Maxim, and Playboy try and outdo each other to attract the most famous bands, models, and personalities to their parties, granting access at eye-watering prices. \"The Saturday night before the Super Bowl is really when everyone wants to go out,\" says Stengele, adding that the Playboy party is often at the top of her corporate clients demand list. \"It's a guy-based event, absolutely,\" she says, about the bash which advertises 24 Playboy bunnies mingling with guests, while the rapper Nelly plays Master of Ceremonies. All tickets include an open bar and buffet. But what else could make the $850 entrance fee worthwhile? \"You can use your imagination,\" she says. \"There are lots of girls in there and lots of drinking. It's an experience.\" \"Every superstar player that's not appearing in the Super Bowl will make a [paid] appearance at one or two of those events prior to the game,\" says Ahmad Tahoun, who organized the New York Giants Super Bowl victory party in Phoenix in 2008. \"Imagine a nightclub two nights before the Super Bowl with nothing but multimillionaire young athletes competing on what they spend,\" he adds. \"It's just champagne and sparklers everywhere.\" This year's hot ticket is the Rolling Stone Magazine party, with performances by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith and Charli XCX. Tickets start at $1,045 and hit $56,238 for a Platinum Center table on rukkus.com. The Victoria's Secret hosted Leather and Laces party starts at $495 for a lounge seat, climbs to $2,500 for a meet and greet with the likes of Adriana Lima and Lily Aldridge, and hits $25,000 for a 'Celebrity Cabana' (includes 14 tickets, 10 bottles of premium liquor, and three bottles of Moet Champagne). Although Tahoun stresses that soirées attended by A-listers are closed to the paying public, some parties advertised as invite-only are anything but. General admission tickets to \"DirecTV's Super Saturday Night Invite-Only Bash,\" featuring a performance from Rihanna, are offered on vividseats.com for $970. While arranging tickets to parties is usually a straightforward process for agencies (promoters offer them first dibs), procuring Super Bowl tickets is another issue entirely. Stengele says she sources some tickets via corporate sponsors, but declines to reveal exactly how she fulfills the remainder of her ticketing obligations. Forging ties with those who have access, along with playing the secondary ticket market (tickets resold online at prices that fluctuate based on supply and demand), are two methods, according to Will Flaherty at SeatGeek. \"A lot of the teams cut deals with ticket brokers and sell their tickets in advance,\" he says, pointing to a controversy last year when the Denver Broncos and Seahawks both sold Super Bowl tickets to Prime Sport.  \"It's not something that teams want people to know that they are doing, particularly teams that have qualified.\" In addition, Flaherty says many agents work the secondary ticket market speculatively, like stock traders. Without holding inventory, they will enter agreements to sell tickets in the two weeks leading up to the playoff semifinals. Once the Super Bowl opponents are determined, prices normally fall by over $1,000 in the two weeks leading up to game day, Flaherty says. The drop allows agents to cover their end of the deal by purchasing cheaper tickets closer to game time at a healthy margin. The trend has been consistent over the last four years, according to data provided by SeatGeek, which places a value score on tickets available across the web. During this year's run-up, however, market forces have worked the other way, pushing the average sold ticket price up 40% from a week earlier to $4,126, potentially leaving risk-takers in turmoil only days before the Super Bowl. The wiliest brokers, however, eschew market speculation for less scrupulous means. \"It's not uncommon to hear stories of agents with briefcases full of cash flying down to Phoenix to buy Super Bowl tickets in hotel lobbies off of players,\" says Flaherty, noting that every NFL player and coach is allotted two Super Bowl tickets to purchase at face value. Reselling the tickets for profit is against NFL rules, a violation for which former Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Tice was fined $100,000 in 2005. Flaherty advises fans to wait until a few days before Super Bowl Sunday to make their purchases, when last minute deals can often be procured. Tahoun suggests the same to party goers: \"Once you get there and your boots are on the ground, you can negotiate better deals for sure,\" he says. For some fans, competing for the best deals off the field is part of the fun. Most, however, would prefer to revel in what Phoenix has to offer and leave the strategizing to the professionals."}

Yet 10 years after his death, he's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that's long defined relations among and between Israelis and Palestinians. So, too, has the violence that's marred the region for decades. Recent incidents have stirred fears in Israel of a return to 2002, then in the midst of a second intifada, or armed uprising, when the Israeli government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks. Fatah cancels Arafat memorials after bombings, blames Hamas . On one day alone last week, an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a Tel Aviv street while three Israelis were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same West Bank hitchhiking post where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year. This came after several incidents in which drivers ran into crowds on busy streets, and before Tuesday, when two knife- and axe-wielding Palestinian cousins killed four Israelis worshipping at a Jerusalem synagogue. So does this all mean a third intifada is coming, if it's not already here? No -- or, at least, not yet, according to experts. Much has changed, they point out, since Arafat's death. It's harder than ever to get from the West Bank into Israel, especially with explosives and such. There has been no call to arms by the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank; instead, analysts say, there has been significant cooperation with Israeli authorities to ferret out potential attackers. And there haven't been anything close yet to the coordinated, large-scale attacks in Israel like those of the early 2000s. As retired former Israeli National Security Adviser Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror pointed out last week, what's happening now \"falls far from\" the first two intifadas, as far as the overall threat to Israel. But one thing that hasn't changed is the deep frustration among Palestinians. Now, as was the case over a decade ago, many still harbor steep distrust at Israeli authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough. \"The nature of these movements is that spark could ignite the tinder,\" said Jon B. Alterman, the head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Middle East program. \"... And once it starts moving, you have no idea where it's going to go.\" Israeli troop kill Palestinian man in West Bank clashes . Voids in Palestinian hope, leadership . Arafat is still considered a hero among many Palestinians, as the scenes around the West Bank commemorating his death last Tuesday showed. This was a man, according to his supporters, who stood up to Israel. This was a man who rallied Palestinians to fight. This was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent Palestinian state. Not only is there no more Arafat, but the idea of a unified Palestinian front is a thing of the past as well. Arafat's former group, Fatah, now controls the West Bank under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, while rival Hamas is in charge of Gaza. \"You have an unprecedented division,\" said the Brookings Institution's Khaled Elgindy, contrasting that to what he views as Israeli leadership that's become more conservative and less willing to compromise. \"It's a much weaker leadership than we've ever seen.\" The lack of a unifying figure, like Arafat, has led to a \"complete alienation of the people from leadership,\" said Ingrid Jaradat Gassner of the Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem. Not only don't they have a person to rally around, there's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many Palestinians. \"People really have no expectation, no hope, no perspective in terms of their being any chance that comes through a political initiative,\" Gassner told CNN from her home in Bethlehem. \"So what we have is an outburst of frustration.\" What there is not, however, is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against Israelis -- which was unlike, many say, happened during the second intifada. In some ways, that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel, only the attacker may know what will happen next. \"This is a huge problem because there is no intelligence,\" Amidror told reporters on a call coordinated by the Israel Project. \"Someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying, 'Today, I'll kill some Israelis.' \"There is no organization behind it,\" the former Israeli national security adviser said, noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack. \"... I don't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual (like that).\" 2 killed, 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on Israelis . Israeli policies have an impact . What's happening and what's not happening, if you're talking about major attacks, is a testament to Israel's policies as well. A lot has changed since what Israelis called the \"Passover massacre,\" when a man walked into a seaside hotel in spring 2002 and blew himself up, killing 30 civilians. For one, a wall -- or a fence, depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the West Bank and Israel, making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons. Also, Israel has a renowned intelligence apparatus that's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers. This is on top of other policies, like stringent measures restricting citizens' ownership of firearms. And even as they push for independence, Israeli authorities also have found a working security partner in the Palestinian Authority. Behind the scenes, the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks, not to mention common foes from Hamas. \"The two have worked together, and it has prevented many terror attacks inside Israel,\" said the Israel Project's David Harris, predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds. \"And it has also brought much more calm.\" Yet as clashes in the West Bank last Tuesday showed, it sometimes doesn't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand. And Palestinians don't live only there and in Gaza. Many live in Israel, including some 300,000 in East Jerusalem, where there has been recent unrest centered around what Jews know as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. \"The fear for Israel is that the new terrorists (will be) on this side of the fence,\" said Harris. Violence, bad feelings never went away . Even then, discontent among so-called Arab Israelis is not a new thing either. In fact, experts say -- from a security situation -- Israel appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago. The measures it's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence. But according to Gassner, Palestinians' frustrations \"have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons.\" She says that many feel that Israelis -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for \"normal lives.\" \"People want to take care of their families, get their kids to school, have enough income to live off of,\" she said. \"And then the pressure just builds up. That's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration.\" Elgindy, from Brookings, said more forceful responses by Israel to attacks can backfire, reasoning, \"When you respond to violence with more repression, you're going to get more violence.\" The \"primitive assault tactics\" now being used against Israelis -- knives and cars, rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the Palestinians' storyline, especially if Israeli security forces respond \"with a heavy hand\" as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after Tuesday's synagogue attack, expert Assaf Moghadam said. \"(Such tactics) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation; they can claim 'we don't have better means of disposal,'\" said Moghadam, from the Israeli-based International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. \"It's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party.\" It's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace, security and happiness to both Israelis and Palestinians -- that has some especially worried. If there's no political end in sight, what's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build? \"It's probably not going to get a lot worse, and it's almost certainly not going to get a lot better,\" said David Pollock, the director of the Washington Institute's Fikra Forum. \"The best you can say, on both sides, is, 'Well, at least we're not like Syria and Iraq.\" CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN)Two worlds. Two identities and the ever-present, very real risk of death. That was the life of Morten Storm, a radical Islamist turned double agent, who's now lifting the lid on some of the world's best-kept secrets. His life is the stuff of spy novels, and he talks about it in his book: \"Agent Storm: My Life Inside al Qaeda and the CIA,\" co-authored by CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister. Both men are CNN contributors. He also recently sat down with CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson. \"I had these different names. I had different personalities,\" Storm said. \"I was Morten Storm, Murad Storm, Abu Osama, Abu Mujahid.\" He was so trusted by senior al Qaeda leaders he once fixed one up with a European wife, all the while -- Storm claims -- working for Western intelligence agencies. \"For half a decade, I moved back and forth between two worlds and two identities -- when one misplaced sentence could have cost me my life,\" he writes in the book. \"Traveling between atheism and hardline Islam, English and Arabic.\" \"It's some kind of schizophrenic lifestyle,\" he said. Excerpt: Finding a wife for Anwar al-Awlaki . Growing up . Storm's remarkable journey began rather unremarkably in Denmark, in a town called Korsor. It's a place with plenty of places for a young boy to play and Storm remembers, fondly, his time in the forest and on the beach. He also remembers struggling with the absence of his father. Storm started getting into trouble early. As a teen, he committed armed robbery and got into fighting, feeding off the adrenaline of both. \"Boxing for me was a way of getting out my aggressions,\" said Storm, who didn't limit his fights to the ring. By his 18th birthday, he'd landed himself in jail. After he got out, Storm joined the Bandidos, a biker gang, working as its muscle. His life was going nowhere good -- and fast. Finding 'truth' Storm's trajectory changed after he found a book on the life of the Prophet Mohammed in the tiny religion section at the Korsor library. \"It changed me. It spoke to me, that book. This is the truth,\" he said. \"I found the truth.\" Storm became Murad Storm and traveled to Yemen, where he learned Arabic and a strict uncompromising interpretation of Islam. He named his son after Osama bin Laden. Storm dove head first into the world of jihad, traveling with Danish journalist Nagieb Khaja, who wanted to shoot a film about mujahedeen in Yemen. While there, Storm befriended Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was poised to become a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and a major U.S. target. \"They were joking, sitting and telling stories -- joking about some of the stuff that they missed in the Western countries,\" Khaja said about Storm and al-Awlaki. \"They talked a lot about jihad, for example. And again, Storm was an extreme guy. Storm was being talked down by Anwar al-Awlaki,\" Khaja said. \"Al-Awlaki was telling Storm to chill out.\" Undeterred, Storm decided to join jihadists in Somalia, but, at the last minute, he got a call telling him not to come. The situation on the ground had grown too dangerous. \"I'm so deeply disappointed, and devastated,\" Storm told CNN. \"I felt betrayed.\" And in his disappointment, doubt began to grow. Switching sides . Sitting in front of a laptop, Storm typed in some of his concerns. \"I hit the 'enter' and I saw plenty of websites talking about contradictions in the Quran,\" he said. \"It took some time to research them, but once I concluded that they were genuinely contradictions, that's when it wiped totally away my faith,\" Storm said. \"That's when I stopped being a Muslim in my heart -- in my belief.\" He got in touch with Danish intelligence agents and told them he wanted a new career. No longer a Muslim, Storm said he wanted to help fight the war on terror. Agents wasted no time putting him to work, making him an agent in demand. His successes, Storm says, soon attracted the attention of the CIA. Hans Jorgen Bonnichesen is the former head of the Danish intelligence agency, known as PET. \"There's no doubt that he was a very valuable agent and has access to some of the sources they really want to get access to,\" he said. A Dane who looks every inch like his Viking ancestors, Storm was exactly what the intelligence community was looking for at the time -- a double agent with an al Qaeda Rolodex to match. The CIA denied repeated requests for comment on Storm's story. Likewise, officials in Denmark have never confirmed or denied his claims. \"By almost sheer luck to some extent that he had been to the many places; he had met all the right people,\" Magnus Ranstorp, one of Scandinavia's top counterterrorism experts, said about Storm. \"I don't think that there are many people like him that have all those different dimensions. He was the real deal,\" Ranstorp said. Playing matchmaker . Storm's authenticity was tested by both sides when al-Awlaki asked him to find a European blonde to be his third wife. His search led to Irena Horak, from Croatia, a recent convert to Islam who called herself Aminah. The plan was a basic honey trap. The blonde was to be bait -- an unsuspecting sacrificial lamb, to lure and kill a lustful al Qaeda leader. Through Storm, al-Awlaki and Aminah exchange encrypted emails and swapped videos. They agreed to marry. For his troubles, Storm says he was promised and received $250,000 when Aminah crossed into Yemen, unknowingly carrying a tracking device hidden inside of a suitcase. He later got an email from al-Awlaki, who wrote that he had married Aminah and that she was better than he had hoped. However, Storm also got an email from Aminah. She wrote that al-Awlaki had told her to dump the suitcase before they met. She had left both it and the tracking device behind. Storm says his CIA handlers were furious: \"The Americans refused to speak to me for six months.\" But, Storm says, they came around. Hunting for any leads on al Qaeda, Storm says, the CIA continued to seek out his help, promising as much as $5 million for information leading to the capture or death of al-Awlaki. Going public . Al-Awlaki was eventually tracked down and killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011. His wife, Aminah, reached out to Storm via email and told him that she offered to become a suicide bomber but had been rebuffed.  CNN tried to reach Aminah through her family, but they would not talk to us. Also, a European counterterrorism official tells CNN that a threat bulletin had been issued at the time, warning that Aminah could be a danger. But Storm insists it was his work that finally found al-Alwaki. But in a conversation taped by Storm at a hotel that same year, an American insisted that a separate stream of intelligence had led to the terror leader. The bottom line: Storm was not going to be paid the $5 million he felt he was owed. His relationship with his handlers deteriorated and, Storm says, he eventually stopped working for the CIA and the Danish intelligence agency PET. The latter tried to buy his silence after it learned he was considering going public with his story. Storm claims the Danish intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5m Danish krone ($260,000) over five years. He told the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten that PET had offered him the money tax-free. But he said he rejected the deal because PET had broken a series of promises to him, including providing permanent residence status in Denmark for his foreign wife. After so many years playing so many different parts, Storm's toughest role may lie ahead: staying alive. He is in hiding after several death threats from militant Islamists who were once his comrades. The threat was made abundantly clear last year when ISIS fighters in Syria issued a video in which they shot at a picture of him attached to a wall. \"Either they will slice your throat, behead you, or they shoot you and hang you up and crucify you,\" Storm said about his time as a spy. \"I would get executed.\"\n\n**News 3**:\nLooking pale, thin and emotional, Gilad Shalit was reunited with his family Tuesday after more than five years in captivity. Now he faces what is likely to be a bewildering few days, weeks and months as he readjusts to a life of liberty. While no one yet knows exactly what he went through, other captives' experiences give an insight into his likely state of mind -- and suggest that although he has his freedom, other challenges lie ahead. Only 19 at the time of his capture in June 2006, Shalit was known to few outside his circle of family, friends and fellow soldiers. But after years spent in virtual isolation, he has been thrust into the limelight and faces a barrage of media attention. Speaking to Egyptian television shortly after his release, Shalit said he had missed his family and friends. \"I missed interacting with normal people,\" he told the interviewer. A few details emerged later as his father, Noam Shalit, addressed the throng of reporters gathered outside the family's home in northern Israel. His son felt good, he said, but was suffering the effects of small shrapnel wounds received long ago but never properly treated, as well as a lack of sunlight. While Gilad was very happy to be home, it was difficult for him to be exposed to so many people after so long in isolation, unable to speak to anyone in his own language, Noam Shalit said. \"He basically came out of a dark hole, a dark basement, and came out of that to this great crowd,\" he said, adding that it must have been amazing for his son to see such a show of support from their village and the country. The family had greeted Gilad with big hugs, he said, but so far they had had little chance to do more than eat together in what had been an exhausting day. \"He said in the beginning the conditions were difficult and he wasn't particularly well treated, but more recently things improved,\" he said of his son, adding that he was sure the family would learn more over time. David Senesh, an Israeli clinical psychologist and former prisoner of war based near Tel Aviv, told CNN that Shalit may continue to feel isolated despite being back among loved ones. \"I think the most difficult thing he will have to cope with is that he has been going through an experience that is very difficult to communicate, to explain to the ordinary person,\" he said. But Senesh said it was a good sign that Shalit had expressed a wish to talk about his ordeal. \"That will help his readjustment as long as it comes from him and is not solicited by the media or other people,\" he said. Senesh, who was held for 40 days in an Egyptian jail following the Yom Kippur War in 1973, said his own experience was made easier by being held with fellow prisoners and, on his release, returning to the familiarity of his army unit. But Shalit has been kept in virtual isolation. And his long captivity has not only affected him but also the family members who have \"gone through hell\" by extension, as they feared for his safety and fought for his freedom, Senesh said. \"It will be difficult to adjust to normal life. He will have to find out what it is because it's not what he left five years ago. It's a completely different life, different family,\" Senesh said. \"Everybody is involved with the trauma.\" He suggests that what Shalit will most need is time and a period of peace and privacy to come to terms with what he has experienced. But unlike some prisoners of war in previous decades, Shalit will not have to deal with the trauma alone. Israel has many professionals who can provide support and advice based on the experiences of others who have been held captive, Senesh said, and there is an enormous desire in Israel to see him recover fully. While little is known about Shalit's day-to-day conditions, the fact he appears healthy -- if thin and wan -- is promising, said Walter Busuttil, a physician and retired Royal Air Force wing commander who was part of a clinical team that rehabilitated British hostages released from Lebanon in 1991, among them Terry Waite, a former envoy to the archbishop of Canterbury. But medical professionals will need to monitor Shalit's sleep and weight patterns for signs he is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, said Busuttil, now medical director for the British veterans' charity Combat Stress. If he was blindfolded or had disrupted sleep or irregular meals during his captivity, Shalit will need to adjust, Busuttil said. Weight loss can also be an indicator of other ill treatment, he added. The soldier's youth may have been a disadvantage, he said, as evidence shows the young and old are more vulnerable to developing PTSD. But if those around him are vigilant, any lasting effects can be mitigated. \"The other thing that is important is to make him feel in control,\" he said. \"What we did with the Beirut hostages was give them a watch. It was probably the first thing taken away from him -- and it would be one of the first things I'd give back, to give him a time reference for day or night.\" It would be better if Shalit were kept away from the media for a few days, Busuttil said, in order for him to adjust before speaking publicly. Shalit may also feel a sense of dissociation after being kept in virtual isolation, he warned. While in captivity, Shalit had access some of the time to newspapers and to a radio, according to Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, but he was a young, apparently shy man cut off from all who knew him. Nothing is yet known of the personal resources Shalit found to keep hope alive during the years he was held by Hamas. But he may have found some comfort in the assurances given by Israel's military that it will always do its utmost to secure the return of its soldiers. \"The principle of returning POWs, MIAs, kidnapped and fallen IDF personnel has been sacrosanct since the IDF's inception in 1948,\" the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website says. \"The IDF does all in its power to locate its captured personnel and free them.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that commitment in his remarks after Shalit's release. Referring to his own military service, Netanyahu said: \"I always knew that if I or one of my comrades fell captive, the government of Israel would do its utmost to return us home, and as prime minister, I have now carried this out.  As a leader who daily sends out soldiers to defend Israeli citizens, I believe that mutual responsibility is no mere slogan -- it is a cornerstone of our existence here.\" James Welsh, a researcher on health and detention for Amnesty International, told CNN there was good reason to be hopeful for Shalit's future well-being now he was back home. \"We shouldn't underestimate people's resilience,\" he said. \"There's a tendency to look on the gloomy side when we hear about people being released, but people do have amazing resources, so they can survive things quite well.\" Of course, Shalit is not alone in celebrating his freedom Tuesday. The 477 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Shalit were also reunited with family and friends  -- many of them after long periods in detention. Hundreds more will be released in a second stage later this year. While the circumstances are not the same, those prisoners -- including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis -- will also face a significant period of adjustment after their rapturous reception by tens of thousands of supporters in Gaza and elsewhere. Hamas official Hassan Youssef welcomed their release, but said it was not enough. \"We are all shedding two tears: One tear for the release of all of our fighters, and a tear of pain for all of our brothers still in prison,\" he said. Shalit's father, Noam, also reflected on the pain felt by Israelis who have watched those convicted of attacks on their loved ones leave jail early. Roxana Saberi, an Iranian-American journalist who was released four months into an eight-year jail term after being convicted of spying in Iran, offered some advice to freed American hikers Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal last month that may also be of use to Shalit as he seeks to make sense of his new reality. She urged them not to rush things, telling CNN: \"I hope that they are able to adapt well in this new part of their life and perhaps learned lessons in prison that can help them when they're free. \"I would tell them to take their time and not feel pressured to make decisions. This is their time. It's theirs again.\"\n\n**News 4**:\n(CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Peter Mance knows every street before he sets foot in a city. It's not because he's visited before. It's because he's autistic and has an uncanny ability to memorize maps. \"He's actually a big help when traveling,\" jokes his mother, Kim Mance, founder of women's travel blog Galavanting and the Travel Blog Exchange, a community of travel writers and bloggers. Mance's other son, 10-year-old son Stephen, has used a wheelchair since surgery to remove a spinal tumor left him paralyzed from the waist down. Mance always has to make extra phone calls to ensure there's an accessible subway or hotel room, but that hasn't stopped her from vacationing with her sons all over the world. While she mostly travels for work, Mance says taking Peter on trips since he was diagnosed with autism at age 2½ helped him not get \"rutted into routine.\" Some autistic children can't stand to have their schedules disrupted, she explained. \"By [traveling] consistently over time, he's developed ways to cope with being outside his routine,\" she said. To help comfort Peter, Mance created games -- like hunting to find his pajamas -- that he plays in every new place he visits. Traveling with children is difficult, but when children have wheelchairs or communication problems, it can be overwhelming for parents to plan even a weekend getaway. \"You cannot pick up and go like everyone else does. You have to plan your trip very carefully,\" says Jani Nayar, executive coordinator of the Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality. About 2.9 million youths ages 17 and younger have a disability, according to the 2009 American Community Survey. Even if it requires extra planning, Nayar says, it's important for children with disabilities -- whether they're blind, deaf, autistic or use a wheelchair -- to \"get out of the house and travel like any other child.\" Michell Haase, founder of TravelinWheels.com, a site that offers travel tips for disabled people, suggests that families \"start small.\" \"It doesn't have to be the big trip to France,\" she said. For families that haven't traveled before, Haase suggests driving to a nearby city and trying a hotel stay. In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act required that hotels provide accessible amenities. But when booking a room, Haase says to be specific about your needs. \"Don't just ask if the room is accessible, because it means so many things to so many people,\" she said. It's OK to ask questions and request for a certain bed height or shower chair, she added. During trips, Haase has persuaded hotel managers to get rid of their shower chairs without supportive backs in favor of ones that people with balance issues, like her daughter Kelsey, can use. Kelsey, 18, uses a wheelchair because she has spina bifida, a condition that prevents the spinal cord from developing. She has traveled all over the country as a wheelchair athlete and is the national powerlifting champion for her weight class. Though Kelsey's mother plans ahead by making phone calls and researching accessible options online, the two have had their fair share of travel hiccups. The list includes being stuck in the rain at a rental car facility without an accessible shuttle and being stranded in excruciating heat when a Chicago trolley car was too crowded to fit her daughter's wheelchair. Regardless of the amount of planning, parents can't predict a broken subway elevator or an unexpected flight of stairs. \"I'm always having to be five steps ahead of the game and thinking what we're going to need. And then, when it doesn't work out, it becomes really frustrating,\" Haase said. Overcoming the intimidation of taking a trip is the biggest obstacle, Mance says. But once parents get over the learning curve of knowing where to go and how to get from point A to point B, traveling with a disabled child becomes second nature. \"Over the years, I've developed this sixth sense about which entrance is more likely to have a ramp or certain places that may be able to accommodate even just space between chairs at restaurants,\" says Mance, who has taken her sons to Japan, Morocco and several European countries. Sometimes, Mance has her autistic son, Peter, wear a button or T-shirt that says, \"I'm autistic. Please be patient.\" The message is a friendly reminder to other travelers that her son isn't purposely acting out. \"You'd be surprised how somebody can get really irritable because they think your kid is misbehaving,\" she said. About one in 110 children have an autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though Mance says Peter looks forward to each excursion, not all autistic children handle new adventures well. \"There are some kids with autism that love to travel and do really well. For others, it can just be more challenging,\" said Lisa Goring, the vice president of family services at Autism Speaks. If a child thrives in rigid routines, Goring suggests parents tell their child in advance that they will be exploring a new place. Creating a book with pictures of the travel destination can also help children know what to expect. When planning a trip, find out if attractions in the area offer special programs. The Garden State Discovery Museum in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, has Open Arms Family Evenings several times a year. The program allows families with autistic children to explore the hands-on museum, which includes simulating scenarios such as visiting a doctor's office, buying fruit at a market and ordering food at a diner. Autistic children who struggle with daily activities benefit from the museum, said Judy Shapiro, director of sales and marketing. \"The more they can practice in a safe environment, the better they are in the real world because it's not new to them,\" she said. Parents who don't want to navigate cities may enjoy cruises that have accessible pools and programs just for kids. Nayar pointed out that many ships allow parents and their disabled children to attend youth activities together. The all-time best place to travel with a disabled child? The Magic Kingdom, mothers and travel experts say. \"Disney World is the nirvana,\" Haase says. \"We usually go to Disney World and almost forget that there's any issue.\" Disney provides Guest Assistance Cards for anyone with a disability. Guests can use the cards to wait in separate lines for rides, and up to five members may go on the attraction with the cardholder. Mance recently took her kids to Disney World and said the pass allowed her family to get through the lines \"exponentially faster.\" She said her son loved the graffiti-style signs with a wheelchair symbol because they were geared toward kids. \"He felt so accepted,\" she said. Disney also permits a family member to test a ride -- without waiting in line twice -- to gauge how a disabled child may react before he or she gets on. In case rides or crowds are too loud, Mance brings along ear plugs so Peter can block the noise. New York City is one of the most accessible cities in the country, according to Nayar. Besides accessible museums and public transportation, organizations are spearheading efforts to make theater productions more accessible. In June, the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts kicked off the Broadway Accessibility Initiative, which aims to make Broadway shows more enjoyable for the deaf and the blind. At no charge, hearing impaired theatergoers may use I-Caption, a handheld device that displays dialogue, lyrics and show announcements. Visually impaired patrons may use D-Scriptive, an audio device that relates all visual elements of a show, including choreography, lighting, sets and costumes. The goal is to \"open up Broadway to an audience who has historically not been reached out to,\" said Sharon Jensen, executive director of Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts. Families that prefer outdoor recreation don't have to stay at home either. Almost all national parks have accessible hiking trails or activities like kayaking. Some state parks -- in states such as Wisconsin,  Pennsylvania and  South Dakota -- have accessible cabins that include kitchens with low counters, showers that fit wheelchairs and hospital beds with lifts. \"Traveling allows kids to see the world in a positive light, but planning a dream vacation isn't going to be simple,\" Haase said. \"Especially when they're disabled, you want them to have a good experience, so it's a lot of pressure,\" she said. But by not staying in the protection of their own home, Haase says, she and Kelsey are showing able-bodied people what they can change at hotels, restaurants and attractions to make life a little easier on others. \"It's one thing to have a law that says you have to do this,\" she said. \"It's a whole other thing to see somebody experience the struggle and then want to help them.\""}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7485, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\nThe cricketing world has been rocked by fresh revelations over alleged fixing by former New Zealand internationals, following the leak of player statements made to a corruption inquiry. The scandal has prompted ex-Black Caps star Chris Cairns to confirm that he is \"Player X\" -- the prominent former international accused in the statements of pressuring others to fix in matches -- while rejecting the allegations against him and vowing to clear his name. \"I have not denied I am Player X,\" he wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday. \"It's the allegations I reject... Thanks for all the support out there and to all those who understand that there are bigger forces at play here.\" The International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) has previously confirmed it was conducting an investigation into Cairns and fellow former New Zealand internationals Lou Vincent and Daryl Tuffey. Cairns, considered one of the game's leading all-rounders in his day, has challenged match-fixing allegations in the courts in the past, and won. In 2012, he sued Indian cricket official and businessman Lalit Modi in a British court, after Modi had tweeted allegations of match-fixing relating to Cairns' stint with the Chandigarh Lions in the short-lived Indian Cricket League (ICL). Cairns captained the side in 2007 and 2008, playing alongside Vincent in 2008. Modi, who ran the rival Indian Premier League competition, lost his appeal against the court's decision in October 2012, with damages increased to £90,000 ($147,459). Tuffey, a bowler who played his last Test for New Zealand in 2010, also denies any involvement in fixing. In the latest revelations, Vincent is reported to have told ACSU investigators he fixed in at least 12 games in five countries from 2008 to 2012, beginning with his time with the Chandigarh Lions. He then reportedly continued to fix in the English county competition, and the Twenty20 Champions League, using tactics such as changing the color of his bat handle to show that a fix was occurring. 'Hero' and friend . According to the reports, Vincent, 35, identified six other players he believes were involved in fixing, and told investigators he had been drawn into the practice under the influence of a prominent former international -- referred to by the press as Player X -- whom he felt he could not refuse. New Zealand's current captain Brendon McCullum also reportedly told investigators that a friend and \"hero\" had twice attempted to persuade him to fix, first in India ahead of the start of the inaugural Indian Premier League in 2008, then shortly afterwards in England during a New Zealand tour. McCullum reportedly refused the advances, which allegedly included an offer of more than £100,000, and advice on how to launder any illicit gains through the purchase of property in Dubai. New Zealand Cricket CEO David White stressed that McCullum was not under investigation by the ICC, and expressed dismay his testimony had been leaked to media. \"I can confirm that Brendon is not under investigation by the ICC and in fact his testimony has been applauded by them,\" White said. \"He was approached to match-fix, he has refused that and reported it to the ICC. Brendan has done the right thing. We believe this is brave and courageous, and he has shown a great example as an international captain.\" Heath Mills, chief executive of the New Zealand Cricket Players' Association, also criticized the leak of the players' statements, saying it \"completely undermines any trust or confidence players may have in cricket's anti-corruption systems.\" 'A complete lie' In response to the claims, Cairns issued a statement describing the allegations against him as a \"complete lie.\" \"Lou Vincent... appears to have confessed to match fixing in respect of games played in numerous countries around the world, most of which I have had no connection to,\" read the statement from the 43-year-old, who made his Test debut in 1989 and played his last one-day international in 2006. \"He is in a desperate position. He faces potential prosecution and in trying to negotiate a plea bargain he appears to be willing to falsely accuse me of wrongdoing.\" In regard to McCullum's allegations, he wrote: \"I have no idea why he would say the things he is alleged to have said. To be clear, I have never approached Brendon, or anyone else, about match-fixing or any other improper activity. \"I have nothing to hide.\" The son of former New Zealand cricket great Lance Cairns, Cairns played for New Zealand's test and one-day team and captained the side on a number of occasions. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that Vincent's ex-wife had also testified to investigators that Cairns was the ringleader behind the alleged ICL fixing, providing a sworn statement to ACSU that said: \"Lou said Chris was going to pay him US$50,000 a game for the fixing.\" TVNZ reported she said Vincent had met a stranger with a briefcase full of money in India, and that she and her husband \"fell out about the whole ICL fixing thing, as I didn't want him to be involved, but Lou kept saying, 'Don't worry we're all doing it.'\" She claimed her ex-husband had once called her in tears, saying he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars after his attempts to fix had gone wrong, TVNZ reported. Lily-white? New Zealand regularly ranks as one of the world's least corrupt countries, recently topping Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index alongside Denmark. New Zealand sportswriter Joseph Romanos said the allegations of corruption surrounding celebrated athletes in the country's summer game had come as a shock to many. \"New Zealanders, perhaps unrealistically, think of themselves as fairly lily-white in terms of match-fixing and banned drugs in sport,\" he told CNN. \"It's always a huge shock when someone's done -- although when you catalog it all, we can mix it with the best of them on the wrong side of the line.\" Australian cricket writer Gideon Haigh said New Zealand players may have been targeted for approaches as the country had had the highest number of defectors to the \"rebel\" ICL competition, and were \"comparatively speaking poorly paid by international standards.\" \"I guess they were the first targets of ICL recruiting agents and therefore became exposed to a tournament where really nothing hinged on the outcome and the amounts being paid were far more than the individual players were worth,\" he told CNN. \"Nothing is more conducive to corruption than meaningless cricket, and sums of money that are odds with the scale and importance of the game.\" Recent scandals . International cricket has been plagued by the specter of match-fixing in recent years, with three Pakistani players banned by the ICC and sentenced by a British court for spot fixing during a Test match against England at Lord's in 2010. In August last year, seven were charged in Bangladesh with match-fixing; former national captain Mohammad Ashraful had previously confessed to fixing matches. And in October, six international umpires were stood down following an India TV expose which alleged officials were willing to fix matches at the recent T20 World Cup in exchange for payment. Haigh said the game's administrators had failed to keep pace with developments in the south Asian gambling market. \"Under the present climate where vast quantities (of money) have entered the game over the past 10 years and the game is still trying to operate under institutional structures that were devised during the 20th century, I think cricket's got a lot of catching up to do,\" he said. He wasn't confident that administrators would tackle the problem anytime soon. \"Frankly, they simply haven't been focused on this. They've been too busy attempting to make money themselves,\" Haigh said. \"It took a very, very long time for cycling to take seriously the issue of doping. It's amazing how long administrators can stave off doing anything serious.\" He said if a broadcaster or major sponsor took a stance on corruption in the game, it could help efforts to driver out fixers. Until then, fans would be left wondering every time they saw something out of the ordinary on the pitch. \"I suppose the worst thing is the not knowing,\" said Haigh. \"Once the hint of corruption enters into cricket, it becomes very difficult for you to take pleasure in its inherent unpredictability.\" READ MORE: ICC confirms fixing investigation involving New Zealand cricketers .\n\n**News 2**:\nThe phone of the first officer of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was on and made contact with a cell tower in Malaysia about the time the plane disappeared from radar, a U.S. official told CNN on Monday. However, the U.S. official -- who cited information shared by Malaysian investigators -- said there was no evidence the first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, had tried to make a call. The official told CNN's Pamela Brown on Monday that a cell-phone tower in Penang, Malaysia -- about 250 miles from where the flight's transponder last sent a signal -- detected the first officer's phone searching for service roughly 30 minutes after authorities believe the plane made a sharp turn westward. The details do appear to reaffirm suggestions based on radar and satellite data that the plane was off course and was probably flying low enough to obtain a signal from a cell tower, the U.S. official said. The revelation follows reporting over the weekend in a Malaysian newspaper that the first officer had tried to make a telephone call while the plane was in flight. Asked Sunday by CNN about the newspaper report about a purported effort to make a call by the first officer, Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, \"As far as I know, no, but as I said that would be in the realm of the police and the other international (authorities) and when the time comes that will be revealed. But I do not want to speculate on that at the moment.\" U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the Penang tower. Pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate. \"It would be very rare in my opinion to have someone with a cell phone on in the cockpit,\" safety analyst David Soucie said. \"It's never supposed to be on at all. It's part of every check list of every airline I am familiar with.\" When the plane first went missing, authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched, looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off, but the search turned up nothing. Underwater search is shortened . Efforts to find the missing plane and the 239 people aboard were focused beneath the choppy surface of the southern Indian Ocean on Monday as Australian authorities sent a U.S. Navy-contracted submersible diving toward the sea floor. But after completing just six hours of searching for underwater debris, the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 returned to the surface, according to the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in Perth, Australia. It should have taken the probe and its operators 24 hours to map the first portion of the search area: 16 hours to map, four hours' travel time to just above the ocean floor and back, and four hours for analysts to examine the data gathered. It is unclear how much of the area -- 5 kilometers by 8 kilometers (3.1 miles by 4.9 miles) -- the Bluefin scanned. It could take up to two months to scan the entire search area. Officials said a built-in safety feature recalled the underwater search vehicle after it exceeded its operating depth of 4,500 meters (14,763 feet). Capt. Mark Matthews, who heads the U.S. presence in the search effort, said the Bluefin aborted so the crew could refine the mission parameters. Charts indicated the ocean was at most 4,400 meters (14,436 feet) deep, so when the Bluefin went deeper than that, it was returned to the surface. \"It happened in the very far corner of the area it's searching, so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" The decision to put the Bluefin-21 into the water for the first time in the 38-day search comes nearly a week after listening devices last heard sounds that could be from locator beacons attached to the plane's \"black boxes.\" \"We haven't had a single detection in six days,\" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said. \"It's time to go underwater.\" The probe is equipped with side-scan sonar -- acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound. Such technology is routinely used to find sunken ships and was crucial in finding Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. Houston cautioned against hopes that the underwater vehicle will find wreckage of the plane, which disappeared on March 8 on a flight between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Beijing that should have taken about six hours. \"It may not,\" he said. \"This will be a slow and painstaking process.\" The bottom of the search area is not sharply mountainous -- it's more flat and almost rolling, Houston said. But he said the area probably has a lot of silt, which can \"complicate\" the search. The search area for the Bluefin is in what officials labeled the most likely area the plane could be. \"It was the site of the highest signal strength or the loudest received signal,\" Matthews told CNN, referring to the pings detected by a towed pinger locator, a wing-shaped listening device connected to the ship by a cable. \"It was also where we had an increase in signal strength as we drove through the area and then a decrease as we drove out of the area.\" New clue on the surface of the water? Another possible clue into the plane's disappearance emerged Monday. Australian officials announced the Australian ship Ocean Shield had detected an oil slick Sunday evening. It is unclear where the oil came from. A 2-liter sample has been collected for examination, but it will take a few days to analyze. \"I stress the source of the oil has yet to be determined, but the oil slick is approximately 5,500 meters (3.4 miles) downwind ... from the vicinity of the detections of the TPL on Ocean Shield,\" Houston said. CNN Aviation Analyst Les Abend, who flies a Boeing 777, said the engines on the plane have about 20 quarts of oil each. \"It could be slowly dripping up to the surface,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" \"They're saying an oil slick. I'm wondering if it's just some sort of a fluid slick. It could be (from) hydraulics.\" If it is oil, it's not the first oil slick detected as part of the search. A similar find in the first days of the search was determined to be fuel oil from a freighter. Surface search nearing end . Twelve aircraft and 15 ships participated in Monday's search efforts on the surface, covering an 18,400-square-mile (47,600-square-kilometer) area. The surface search was among the last, Houston said. \"The air and surface search for floating material will be completed in the next two to three days in the area where the aircraft most likely entered the water,\" Houston said. That search was energized last week when searchers using the Navy-owned pinger locator and sonobuoys detected sounds that could have been from the plane's black boxes, or data and voice recorders. But after a week of silence, the batteries powering the locator beacons are probably dead, a top official from the company that manufactures the beacons told CNN on Sunday. They were certified to last 30 days, a deadline that's already passed. That means searchers may not be able to detect any more pings to help lead them to those pieces of the missing plane. \"More than likely they are reaching end of life or already have. If (a beacon) is still going, it is very, very quiet at this point,\" Jeff Densmore told CNN's \"State of the Union with Candy Crowley\" on Sunday. The time is ripe to move on to other search techniques. \"Every good effort has been expended, but it's now looking like the batteries are failing, and it's time to start mowing the lawn, as we say, time to start scanning the sea floor,\" said Rob McCollum, a CNN analyst and ocean search specialist. Catherine Tamoh Lion, the mother of the missing plane's chief steward Andrew Nari, said the news that no more pings have been heard is upsetting. \"Our sadness is now just prolonged,\" she told CNN. \"I feel like they are somewhere,\" she said of the passengers. \"I don't know where. Just praying to God. Miracles can happen. \" How do underwater sonar subs work? What happens after the pingers die? Listening for pings, water plays tricks .\n\n**News 3**:\nThinking about picking up a Wii U this Sunday when it goes on sale? Already have one preordered? Maybe you're planning to brave the lines in hopes of lucking out? It's not too late to change your mind, one way or the other. I've had a Wii U for the past week, and while I'm not allowed to tell you what I think about the system overall until Sunday, I've pulled together a list of points worth considering before you pull the trigger. It's pre-sold out, everywhere. Really. Visit the website of any major retailer that carries video games and you'll find the Wii U is either long gone or wasn't being pre-sold in the first place. The only way to guarantee a system, day one, is to purchase through an auction site like eBay or through retailers that allow third-party sales like Amazon. It's likely you'll pay dearly if you do, of course — from $400 or $500 to upwards of $3,000. You can always stand in line. Many retailers held units back to have on hand, day one, or simply didn't offer pre-sales. You'll want to check with your local stores for their launch day plans, but this is arguably the best route to nab a Wii U at launch if you didn't preorder and don't want to pay scalper prices. Nintendo says it should have plenty to go around. Not on day one, but Nintendo has publicly committed to having more Wii U units in stores during the first week than it did for the Wii six years ago, and it's doubled down on that claim by stating it'll replenish systems \"much more frequently\" during the holiday than it did for the Wii. The Wii U isn't just a Wii plus a DS. It may look like a Wii plus a DS, and it clearly shares second-screen DNA with the DS, but it's not a DS. The DS is about what you can do when you put a second screen right next to the first screen and both of those in a device that fits in your hands. The Wii U is about what you can do if you make one of the screens your TV, snap off the other, then let it wander. And it's not really possible for more than one person to play a DS, whereas multiple players (in the same room) are a key part of the Wii U experience. It's also more than just a souped up Wii. The Wii was arguably just a souped up GameCube with a motion sensor. The Wii U is much more than just a souped up Wii with a tablet controller. It still supports Wii-style motion controls, but its insides are totally different — either as or more powerful than (depending which developer you talk to) current-gen systems like the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. It's also the first HD-capable Nintendo console in the company's history, and so far I'm finding that makes a pretty big difference for the visual artistry, say, in a game like New Super Mario Bros. U. Initial game port fidelity varies, but this tells us little. Running visual comparisons of Batman: Arkham City, I found that while it looks great on the Wii U, the Xbox 360 version's textures tend to be sharper, especially when viewing distant objects. I've also noticed significant slowdown in the Wii U version of Epic Mickey 2 (it was only added as a launch title in early October). What does that mean? It's hard to say. Arkham City is a port of a year-old game that wasn't handled by the original developer. New systems can have steep learning curves, especially when it comes to ports. So while we're probably about to be inundated with visual and performance comparisons, I don't think they'll tell us much about what the Wii U can or can't do, long term. The games only support one Wii U GamePad. The Wii U comes with just one Wii U GamePad, and Nintendo isn't selling the GamePad as a separate SKU (not yet, anyway). There's been plenty of speculation about why this is, but regardless of the real reason, you'll want to be aware that wielding the GamePad is a one-person affair (though it's still possible for up to four other local players to tap into a supported game using Wii Remotes). According to Nintendo: \"In the future, the Wii U console will support, depending on the software, two Wii U GamePad controllers.\" Both the Basic and Deluxe models come with an HDMI cable. And only an HDMI cable. You'd expect the Wii U to forego Component or S-Video, but game consoles usually include a low-end composite cable (red and white for stereo audio, the yellow connector pooling the red, green and blue video signals, which causes color bleed, creating a fuzzier image). Nintendo gets credit for being first to ditch composite entirely, which is kind of historic, since the composite standard came into existence back in 1954. The $350 Deluxe model is a significantly better deal than the $300 Basic model. NintendoLand, the Wii Sports-like showcase game that comes with the Wii U, sells for $60 standalone, so that it's a pack-in with the Deluxe model justifies the extra $50 alone. But the Deluxe also includes 32 GB of internal storage (the Basic only has 8 GB, and roughly 4 GB of that is earmarked for system data), a Wii U GamePad charging cradle, a Wii U GamePad stand and a Wii U console stand. Nintendo's so clearly aiming buyers at the Deluxe model, it'll be a wonder if they sell any Basic systems at all. The Wii U is backward compatible with the Wii. I can't confirm this yet, because the system update necessary to allow the Wii U to play Wii games hasn't arrived, but Nintendo says it's a sure thing. One feature the Wii U won't offer: visual benefits, say upscaling or post-processing, as Sony did for PS1 games on the PS2 and PS2 games on the PS3. According to Nintendo: \"It's possible to play your Wii games on the Wii U, but no, we haven't announced anything about making any changes to those games in any way or changing how they would appear on the Wii U.\" It has no built-in achievement or aggregate scoring system. Love or hate gamer scores and achievements? You'll either love or hate the Wii U. While developers are free to include in-game achievements, Nintendo offers no overarching mechanism for tracking games you've completed or accomplishments within. A possible upside for achievement-lovers? If you're secretly tired of the compulsive, competitive achievement grind, the Wii U offers liberation — a chance to go back to playing games for love of the games instead of an arbitrary number. Wii U games are more expensive than Wii games. Wii games sold on average for $50. Wii U games will sell on average for $60. Nintendo's just playing catchup here, so it's hard to fault the company for raising prices. Just bear in mind that the total cost of owning a Wii U over time is going to be notably higher than it was for owning a Wii. The GamePad is also a TV remote. Nintendo places a TV button right on the Wii U GamePad. Press it, and a touchscreen overlay appears, allowing you to change the channel, bring up your TV guide, turn the power on or off, or adjust the volume, all without reaching for your TV's native remote. It's a modest convenience, but a convenience nonetheless. It's exactly as mobile (or not) as Nintendo says it is. Nintendo claims the Wii U GamePad works away from the base station up to 24 feet. That sounds about right, based on my tests. Your mileage will vary depending on what's in your walls, where you put the base station, what else you're doing (wirelessly speaking), etc. But 24 feet isn't a lot of space, range-wise, meaning the layout of your residence is going to determine whether you can play it in a separate room away from the main one. We still have no idea what the online experience is like. TVii, Miiverse, Nintendo eShop and Wii U Chat are all missing in action at this point, so we have no idea how they work, if they work or what they'll add to the bottom line. With a little luck, Nintendo will remedy this in time for us to talk about this stuff pre-launch, but it's entirely possible day-one reviews will be limited to commenting on the system and games only. Bear that in mind if you're interested in the online features — especially stuff like TVii — and awaiting impressions or verdicts.\n\n**News 4**:\nThe villagers had congregated at the tent, as they often did at the end of the workday, to sit and chat. Among them were men who sold vegetables or wood. Others mined or traded minerals used to make alloys like stainless steel. They were husbands and fathers, brothers and sons. But unlike villagers who might gather like this in many other parts of the world, these men had strange company at their customary get-together. They were living in North Waziristan, one of Pakistan's thinly governed tribal areas bordering Afghanistan and a hotbed of militancy. Hanging above them in the evening sky were four remotely piloted aircraft. Drones. Without warning, the aircraft unleashed a volley of missiles that struck the tent, killing eight people. A few minutes later, after other villagers had approached the wreckage to help the victims, the drones fired again, deepening the carnage. By the end, 18 people were dead, including at 14-year-old boy, and 22 others were wounded, including an 8-year-old girl. \"Body parts were scattered everywhere. Bodies without heads and bodies without hands or legs,\" said Ahsan, a miner and local resident who had been praying at the time of the first wave of missiles. Malala to Obamas: Drone strikes 'fueling terrorism' 'Will I Be Next?' Ahsan's account of the attack in the village of Zowi Sidgi in July 2012, along with those of other witnesses and victims' relatives, form part of a report released Tuesday by Amnesty International titled \"'Will I Be Next?' U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan.\" The report provides detailed information on nine out of 45 drone strikes it says were carried out by the United States in North Waziristan between January 2012 and September 2013. In some of the attacks, it says, the victims weren't members of militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban, but just ordinary civilians, like the workers in Zowi Sidgi. It recounts another strike, in October 2012, in which a 68-year-old woman, Mamana Bibi, was blown apart by a drone as she picked vegetables in front of her grandchildren, several of whom were injured in the attack. \"Amnesty International is seriously concerned that these and other strikes have resulted in unlawful killings that may constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes,\" the report said. Mustafa Qadri, Amnesty International's Pakistan researcher, said that while war crimes have possibly been committed, that cannot be confirmed without more information from the U.S. government. Leaders due to meet . Made public the day before Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is due to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington, the report calls for a series of measures to bring the drone program in line with international law. Those include conducting impartial investigations into the cases documented, bringing those responsible for human rights violations to justice and offering compensation to civilian victims' families. On Tuesday, Sharif was at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington. \"Recently our political parties in a national conference declared the use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country,\" Sharif said. \"This issue has become a major irritant in our bilateral relationship as well. I therefore would stress the need for an end to the drone attacks.\" Sharif has previously called for an end to the U.S. drone program in Pakistan, where it has stirred deep anger, and will raise the issue with Obama on Wednesday, said Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry. \"The government of Pakistan believes drone strikes are against international law and the sovereignty of Pakistan,\" Chaudhry told CNN. \"Drone strikes are counterproductive to fighting terrorism.\" Pakistan wants to persuade the United States to stop using drones, he said. \"International opinion is against drone strikes, not just here in Pakistan, but in the world,\" Chaudhry said. \"This opinion is strengthening.\" Adding to the pressure, Human Rights Watch also released a report on U.S. drone attacks Tuesday -- this one focusing on Yemen. Letta Taylor, a senior counterterrorism researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the group found at least two clear cases of violations of international laws of war, but those did not reach war crimes status. The group said four of the six attacks it had investigated \"may have violated the laws of war.\" Sources: Drone strikes in Yemen kill 6, including senior AQAP leaders . Lack of U.S. disclosure . Based on extensive field research, the reports underlined the difficulties of gathering information on attacks in dangerous areas of Pakistan and Yemen. \"We found that despite assurances from President Obama that (the U.S. government is) doing its utmost to protect civilians from harm, that in fact in many cases it is killing innocent civilians, even dozens of them, if not more,\" Taylor said. And both reports noted the U.S. government's unwillingness to talk about the cases. The lack of information from U.S. authorities, Amnesty said, makes it impossible \"to reach firm conclusions about the context in which the U.S. drone attacks on Mamana Bibi and on the 18 laborers took place, and therefore their status under international law.\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney rejected the idea that the United States has violated any laws. \"To the extent these reports claim that the U.S. has acted contrary to international law we would strongly disagree,\" he said at a press briefing Tuesday. \"The administration has repeatedly emphasized the extraordinary care that we take to make sure that counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law.\" The U.S. government has said strikes by the unmanned aircraft are a necessary part of the fight against militant groups. In May, Obama defended the drone program and disclosed the guidelines determining its use. He said drones would be deployed only when there is an imminent threat, no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist, \"near certainty\" that civilians wouldn't be harmed and \"no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat.\" Civilian victims in Yemen . But Human Rights Watch said the evidence it had gathered \"strongly suggests\" that the strikes in Yemen it documented \"did not adhere\" to the policies set out by Obama. The group said the attacks its report covers took place between 2009 and 2013, killing 82 people, at least 57 of them civilians. The strikes ostensibly targeted suspected members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but victims included women, children, truck drivers and other civilians, the report said. \"At least four of the strikes were carried out by drones, a fifth strike by either drones or warplanes, and a sixth one by cruise missiles releasing cluster munitions, indiscriminate weapons that pose unacceptable dangers to civilians,\" it said. The report also questioned the military validity of several of the suspected al Qaeda operatives targeted. Fear and polarization . Both reports describe the climate of fear created by the drones in Pakistan and Yemen, and the polarizing effect the attacks are having on local populations. \"The ultimate tragedy is that the drone aircraft the USA deploys over Pakistan now instill the same kind of fear in the people of the Tribal Areas that was once associated only with al Qaeda and the Taliban,\" said the Amnesty report. \"Like other forces operating in the Tribal Areas, the USA appears to be exploiting the lawless and remote nature of the region to evade accountability for its violations,\" it said. Human Rights Watch described a similar situation in Yemen. \"We Yemenis are the ones who pay the price of the 'war on terror,'\" Faisal bin Ali Jaber, a relative of a cleric and a police officer who were both killed in a drone attack in August 2012, was quoted as saying in the report. \"We are caught between a drone on one side and al Qaeda on the other.\" The report warned that \"should the United States continue targeted killings in Yemen without addressing the consequences of killing civilians and taking responsibility for unlawful deaths, it risks further angering many Yemenis and handing another recruiting card to AQAP.\" 'A dangerous precedent' The reports set out a list of recommendations, primarily for the U.S. government, but also for authorities in Pakistan and Yemen. More broadly, Amnesty warned that the American government may be setting a troubling standard in its use of drones that other countries could follow. \"U.S. policy and practice on targeted killings and drones are not only of concern in their own right: they also set a dangerous precedent that other states may seek to exploit to avoid responsibility for their own unlawful killings,\" the report said. In Yemen, images of the charred, shattered remains of the cleric and policemen killed in August 2012 have circulated in the village where the attack took place, the Human Rights Watch report says. \"Now when villagers see these images,\" Jaber, the relative, was quoted as saying, \"they think of America.\""}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7434, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- There's little question that EDM (electronic dance music) is the fastest-growing musical genre out there. With DJs like Calvin Harris, David Guetta and Tiësto leading the pack, electronic music's popularity has ballooned in the past decade. From festivals to radio airplay, social media and even collaborating with A-list musicians, EDM artists are getting a lot of attention -- and money -- from all over the place. The numbers don't lie. So far, Forbes' top 10 EDM artists have racked up a combined $268 million this year, an 11% increase from 2013, with top earner Harris bringing in $66 million. How did this musical genre grow from a small, cult following into this global phenomenon we feel today? How have those who've stuck with it from the beginning grown with it? And where is it going next? To obtain these answers we headed to one of the biggest festivals in the world, TomorrowWorld, to meet up with some of the genre's key players: David Guetta, Tiësto, Steve Aoki, and EDM's newest dynamic duo, Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike. The origins of EDM . Electronic dance music is not a new genre. In fact, it's been around for more than three decades. David Guetta, whose DJ days began in Paris in the late 80's, recalls how the house/electronic music movement began when the disco era was ending. \"There was a movement called 'disco sucks',\" he says. \"It was a shame to like disco, but then there was no music to dance to, so some DJs started to use old disco records, but the B-sides and the acapellas, and we began producing beats with drum machines.\" Simply put, DJs snuck disco music into people's ears. \"I remember buying those records and the label (vinyl sticker),\" says Guetta. \"(DJs) would use old records and print on top of it, melt it, and print on the top...very low quality, this was super, super underground.\" In other words, disco music is EDM's ancestor. \"I started in '88 to play House music, it was a huge revolution for me. I went to London and I saw a DJ on stage and that was crazy at the time. I was one of the really respected and famous DJs in Paris, but they would never show me. I was hidden. A DJ on stage and people dancing and facing the DJ, looking at him? I was like 'wow!'\" says Guetta, as if still surprised to this day. A few years later, in the early 90's, in the Netherlands, Tijs Michiel Verwest began his journey to becoming Tiësto. He also started when the genre was completely underground. A trip to Spain, some parties and general love for music got him interested in becoming a DJ. \"Back then, first of all, we all played vinyl records, so even when you knew the track, you could not get it. Everything was very exclusive,\" says Tiësto in his dressing room, 300 meters away from the main stage of TomorrowWorld. \"That's the big difference with nowadays, because when you jam to a track you already know what it is, and then right away you have the song in your phone or your laptop...that was a very magical period because you played a track and people said 'I know this track,' but they still couldn't find it. That was very special,\" says Tijs, as his staff calls him. It's hard to pinpoint a date and location to the beginnings of EDM. Some say it began in Germany and London, others make a case that it started in Detroit, in the U.S. For Guetta, both continents played a role, \"this is what happened...it was born in the U.S., but the U.K. made it trendy. And it became a massive movement in Europe, but never in the U.S., which is crazy\". He later adds, \"I think America is always creating the new movement and then the U.K. has this genius of taking this concept and making it accessible to the masses.\" From underground to the masses . Recently, Guetta has had mainstream success by collaborating with pop stars like Kelly Rowland, and The Black Eyed Peas, for whom he produced the best-selling single 'I Gotta Feeling' in 2009. Other successful DJs, including likes of Calvin Harris and Avicii, have also found success this way. \"I love collaborating outside of my space,\" says Steve Aoki, who has worked with artists like will.i.am and Luke Steele. \"When I got into the dance culture and started producing the music I kept on thinking how to do something unique or different than what the status quo does.\" For EDM, collaborations may have attracted listeners, but the internet and its subsequent components, i.e. social media, apps and music sharing programs, have played essential roles in getting more. Nowadays, in the digital era, success is measured in followers, video hits, downloads, hashtags, tweets, retweets and likes. \"For us it (social media) has played a very big role,\" says Michael Thivaios of the duo Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike. \"We can make a new track and with one click, it'll be spread all over the world. Twenty years ago you had a vinyl, and that vinyl had to go to a distributor, and six months later maybe another country would have the vinyl,\" adds the other half of the duo, Dimitri Thivaios. \"All we did for one year is talk to DJs by Facebook and somehow that got us our first gig. Social media has been the biggest factor in our career.\" In Europe and the Americas, mainly, there are an increasing number of electronic music festivals; events that gather people from all over the world and celebrate in unison. The TomorrowWorld festival celebrated outside of Atlanta, Georgia, gathered 160,000 people from 75 countries this year, according to the organizers. \"It's like a theme park for adults,\" says Thivaios. Not all genres can brag about selling out festivals with over 150,000 attendees, and do it in a matter of minutes. Sure, some could mention the Bonnaroos and the Coachellas of the world, but they offer musical variety. From pop to rock, rap to indie and even country. EDM festivals offer only EDM. \"When I'm on stage I'm looking out and seeing everyone putting up their flags from hundreds of different countries, representing hundreds of different cultural lifestyles. They're all jumping in unison forming almost like one entity, one spiritual being,\" adds Aoki, who, besides his music, is known for his selfies with the crowds, riding inflatable rafts, and caking one lucky fan per show. If you're confused about the latter, it's a Steve Aoki trademark, where he throws a whole cake to someone in the audience. Based on reactions seen from the fans, they love it. \"When they get caked in the face, the first thing they do is immediately turn around to make sure that everyone else saw that they got caked, it's a very bizarre thing. People don't get it,\" says Aoki, full of enthusiasm. Naturally, EDM was unlikely to become this popular without generating incredible amounts of money. A recent report stated that EDM is a $6.2 billion global industry. Most of the money comes from festivals, Las Vegas club dates and other global club gigs. All this peaked the interest of ad men and the big brands they represent. In fact, some have already made moves and are sponsoring festivals, events, and others have DJs featured in commercials. Business is good, but is the music getting better? EDM has been highly criticized. Many see EDM as an art that lost its purity. \"It's an evolution. The thing is that, every musical genre starts from the underground, gets trendy, then it becomes popular, and then it dies or it is reinvented in a different way,\" says Guetta. Many wonder if EDM is at his highest point. Is this its climax? Or will it end soon, just like Disco did? \"They've been asking me that since 1994, 'is it going to end?' I always say I don't know. It keeps evolving, every year something new comes up, and now it's at the highest it ever has been, so now I don't know how much higher and how much better it'll get,\" says Tiësto. \"It has been more than 20-25 years that this music is existing, so it's already amazing.\"\n\n**News 2**:\nWashington (CNN) -- A political standoff that spanned five decades and 10 presidents began to crumble Wednesday with President Barack Obama's move to normalize relations with Cuba. The announcement was the product of a year of clandestine back-channelling between the U.S. and Cuba, facilitated by the Canadians and the Vatican and with personal involvement from the Pope. \"Today, America chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past, so as to reach for a better future for the Cuban people, for the American people, for our entire hemisphere and for the world,\" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision. He added: \"It's time for a new approach.\" Obama said he's instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba to re-establish diplomatic relations, and that the U.S. will re-open an embassy in Havana. The administration will also allow some travel and trade that had been banned under a decades-long embargo instated during the Kennedy administration. \"Neither the American nor Cuban people are well-served by a rigid policy that's rooted in events that took place before most of us were born,\" Obama said. Obama's move risks triggering another fight with Congress, which will come under the full control of Republicans in January. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he would do everything in his power to block any potential U.S. ambassador to Cuba even receive a vote. He also called the easing of economic restrictions \"inexplicable\" in a statement. \"Appeasing the Castro brothers will only cause other tyrants from Caracas to Tehran to Pyongyang to see that they can take advantage of President Obama's naiveté during his final two years in office. As a result, America will be less safe as a result of the President's change in policy,\" he said. Rubio promised that as the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Western Hemisphere subcommittee, he'll \"make every effort to block this dangerous and desperate attempt by the President to burnish his legacy at the Cuban people's [sic] expense.\" RELATED: Five reasons why the Cuba deal happened . Speaking at the same time as Obama from his own country, Cuban President Raul Castro lauded the move. \"This expression by President Barack Obama deserves the respect and recognition by all the people and I want to thank and recognize support from the Vatican and especially from Pope Francis for the improvement of relations between Cuba and the United States,\" he said. Obama's announcement comes as both nations have released political prisoners in a show of goodwill, with American Alan Gross headed home on \"humanitarian\" grounds from Cuba early Wednesday morning. In a separate swap, a U.S. intelligence source held for 20 years was released in exchange for three jailed Cuban spies. Obama said he and Castro spoke Tuesday in a phone call that lasted about an hour and reflected the first communication at the presidential level with Cuba since the Cuban revolution. But some Republicans are warning the move will only strengthen the Castro regime in Cuba, which has long been accused of human rights abuses and is listed by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. Obama said Wednesday he has instructed Kerry, however, to review Cuba's place on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Wednesday's announcement that the U.S. will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba will also make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business with the Cuban people by extending general licenses, officials said. While the more liberal travel restrictions won't allow for tourism, they will permit greater American travel to the island. While only Congress can formally overturn the five decades-long embargo, the White House has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island. And Obama said he plans to \"engage Congress in an honest and serious conversation\" on lifting it. In an effort to boost the nascent Cuban private sector, the President will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to Cuba, particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences, and allow greater business training, as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island. Other announced changes permit U.S. and Cuban banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards. U.S. travelers will be allowed to import up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including $100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even Cuban cigars. Remittances by Americans to their families back in Cuba will also be increased to approximately $2,000 per quarter. Senior administration officials and Cuba observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the United States have created an opening for improved relations. U.S. and Cuban officials say Washington and Havana in recent months have increased official technical-level contacts on a variety of issues. RELATED: Five reasons why the Cuba deal happened . Both Obama and Castro in their Wednesday remarks acknowledged the nations' differences remain. \"I do not expect the changes I am announcing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight,\" Obama said. But he argued that \"through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for our values, and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century.\" Castro said that even as the two nations \"recognize having profound differences — especially in national sovereignty, democracy, human rights and foreign relations policies — we reaffirm our willingness to dialogue in all of these area.\" To that end, Cuba has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the United States. At least one of the prisoners has already been released. Havana has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the Internet and allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years. Talks between the U.S. and Cuba have been ongoing since June of 2013 and were facilitated by the Canadians and the Vatican in brokering the deal. Pope Francis — the first pope from Latin America — encouraged Obama in a letter and in their meeting this year to renew talks with Cuba on pursuing a closer relationship. Gross' release was seen as one of the first clear benefits of those talks. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Gross' Maryland congressman, left Washington at 4 a.m. Wednesday for Cuba, and returned with Gross and his wife, Judy, according to government officials. Gross, speaking at a press conference Wednesday, said he's \"very happy\" with Obama's moves, and heaped praise on the people of Cuba, \"or at least most of them.\" \"It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments' mutually belligerent policies,\" he said. \"Five-and-a-half decades of history shows us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment. Two wrongs don't make a right.\" Gross was arrested after traveling under a program under the U.S. Agency for International Development to deliver satellite phones and other communications equipment to the island's small Jewish population. Cuban officials charged he was trying to foment a \"Cuban Spring.\" In 2011, he was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to set up an Internet network for Cuban dissidents \"to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order.\" Gross' lawyer, Scott Gilbert, told CNN last month the years of confinement have taken their toll on his client. Gross has lost more than 100 pounds and is losing his teeth. His hips are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye. He has also undertaken hunger strikes and threatened to take his own life. With Gross' health in decline, a bipartisan group of 66 senators wrote Obama a letter in November 2013 urging him to \"act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain [Gross's] release.\" The three Cubans released as a part of the deal belonged the so-called Cuban Five, a quintet of Cuban intelligence officers convicted in 2001 for espionage. They were part of what was called the Wasp Network, which collected intelligence on prominent Cuban-American exile leaders and U.S. military bases. The leader of the five, Gerardo Hernandez, was linked to the February 1996 downing of the two civilian planes operated by the U.S.-based dissident group Brothers to the Rescue, in which four men died. He is serving a two life sentences. Luis Medina, also known as Ramon Labanino; and Antonio Guerrero have just a few years left on their sentences. The remaining two — Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez — were released after serving most of their 15-year sentences and have already returned to Cuba, where they were hailed as heroes. CNN's Eric Bradner contributed to this report .\n\n**News 3**:\nA Dallas apartment where the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States had stayed is finally getting a thorough cleaning, days after the diagnosis left four people quarantined there with soiled towels and sweat-stained sheets from the Ebola patient. After some delays, the first of three phases to clean the apartment began Friday afternoon. While the process will take days, at least sheets and towels that Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan used have been removed. Also out are the four people -- the partner of the Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, her 13-year-old son and her two 20-something nephews -- who'd been stuck there for days. They had been ordered to stay inside the apartment until October 19. By that point, enough time should have passed to determine if any of them contracted Ebola or if they're in the clear. Judge Clay Jenkins, director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said Friday that Duncan's partner slept last night on a couch pillow on the living room floor. But now she and the others have a new place to call home in the meantime: a private 4-bedroom residence in Dallas, which was arranged with the help of someone in the local faith-based community. \"They were very glad to be going and very pleased when they got there,\" Jenkins said. \"(One of them) got a big grin on his face, and he said, 'I wish somebody would get me a basketball.' So we're going to see if we can't take care of that.\" The move added to a busy day for the quartet, who until then had gotten little more than brief stops from a health official and were told not to go more than a few steps outside. On Friday, they were visited by a hazardous materials team wearing masks, boots and yellow protective gear, as seen in photos tweeted by Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. A large tarp was laid out, and several oil-drum like containers were on site. Some have criticized the fact that it took so long to start the process, given that health officials announced three days ago that Duncan had Ebola. At that time, four people Duncan had stayed with in the Texas city were ordered not to leave the apartment because of possible lingering effects of Duncan, from his clothes to toilets to silverware. Additionally, the Dallas hospital where Duncan is being treated has come under fire for how it handled his first visit there eight days ago. Duncan's partner, identified only as Louise, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that hospital medical staff were twice told that Duncan, who was suffering with fever and abdominal pain, had recently arrived from West Africa -- key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola, yet was never properly relayed. Instead, he was released with an antibiotic only to come back by ambulance even sicker on Sunday. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged to reporters Friday that \"there were missteps\" in Dallas as to how Duncan's case was initially treated. But he also insisted that \"there were a lot of things that went right and are going right.\" And Fauci stressed that, while there may be a case here and there, what's happened with Ebola in West Africa -- where more than 3,400 people have died and public health infrastructures have become overwhelmed -- won't happen in the United States. \"Our health care infrastructure in the United States is well-equipped to stop Ebola in its tracks,\" Fauci said. Official: 50 being monitored . Until this week, Ebola's impact on the United States has been confined to preemptive measures at airports and elsewhere to stop its spread, the deployment of U.S. military and other resources to West Africa to help corral the outbreak there, and the treatment of a select few Americans who contacted the virus in Africa and were flown back home to get well. But Duncan changed all that. He landed in Dallas on September 20, started feeling sick days later, then made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital late on September 25. He went back three days later and was quickly isolated, with a blood test confirmed he had Ebola on Tuesday. If he gets healthy, Duncan could be in trouble: Some in Liberia have accused him of lying on a pre-flight questionnaire about his contact with Ebola sufferers, leading to threats of charges by authorities there and prompting the Dallas County district attorney's office to announce it is \"looking into whether or not (he) knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter.\" For now, though, any future legal battles are overshadowed by Duncan's fight for his life -- in isolation, in serious condition, at Texas Health Presbyterian. No one he'd come in contact with has shown symptoms of Ebola, though officials were watching them -- 50 people in all -- just in case. These 50 are people Duncan came in contact with while he was contagious. Monitoring means a public health worker visits the contacts twice a day to take temperatures and to ask if they are experiencing any symptoms. Dr. Beth Bell of the CDC said officials are casting a wide net. \"We have a low level of concern about the vast majority of these people that we're following,\" she said. That sentiment was echoed Friday night by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who pointed out \"there is only one person\" -- Duncan, who is in isolated in a hospital -- \"that is actively showing\" signs of Ebola. Only those showing symptoms of Ebola are contagious. \"We're a little anxious, but there is no fear in our eyes,\" Rawlings said of local residents. \"We will be safe, and we will get this done in the appropriate way.\" Ebola in spotlight elsewhere in U.S. Duncan isn't the only person being talked about in the United States with real or possible Ebola. Howard University Hospital in Washington has admitted a low-risk patient with symptoms \"that could be associated with Ebola,\" hospital spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton said Friday. The patient, who was not named, recently traveled to Nigeria and presented with the symptoms upon his or her return, she said. The patient is in stable condition. \"In an abundance of caution, we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient,\" Hamilton said. \"Our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the CDC and the Department of Health.\" Officials in Georgia also said they isolated a man with flu-like symptoms who'd recently been in Africa shortly after his arrest early Friday for suspected drunken driving. But \"so far all of his labwork is negative\" and \"we have no reason to believe that he has Ebola,\" Georgia Department of Public Health commissioner Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald said. But there is one American confirmed with the virus: Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman for NBC News who was diagnosed in Monrovia on Thursday . Dr. Mitchell Levy said his son, Mukpo, remembers getting some fluid in his face while helping to disinfect a chair inside a clinic where he was filming. Mukpo, 33, a freelance cameraman for NBC News, started feeling achy and tired Wednesday, and he quarantined himself. A day later, a test at a Doctors Without Borders facility in Monrovia confirmed that he had Ebola. NBC News has said the entire team will return to the U.S. soon aboard a private charter plane. Levy said that his son will be heading to Nebraska Medical Center, which is the same facility where Dr. Rick Sacra was recently treated. Official: U.S. focusing on 'source countries' As intense as the media attention is in the United States, the issues here are nothing compared to West Africa, where Ebola continues to spread through the living and the dead and where health facilities have often been unable to keep up with the outbreak. The U.S. government has been involved in trying to help countries like Liberia, with more help possibly on its way. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Friday that the U.S. military could send as many as 4,000 troops to the Ebola-afflicted countries. About 200 U.S. troops are there now, and Washington had previously committed to sending 3,000 troops. The U.S. troops will not treat patients, but will help establish health facilities and medical treatment units \"so that the health care workers can do their jobs,\" Kirby said. Paying attention to West Africa, whether it's getting Ebola patients well there or doing things to prevent infected people from leaving the country, is a national security priority for the United States, said Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser. Monaco said Friday: \"We are taking steps to address the source, the people coming from the source counties and we think those are the most effective steps we can take.\"\n\n**News 4**:\nMy first foray into deep water brings me face to face with some of the islands' most ebullient locals. As shoals of slim surgeonfish, parrotfish and clownfish wind between the gray rocks and drift in the current, they suddenly appear -- six Galapagos sea lions -- fat sleek bullets that zoom right up to my mask, upside down and mouths open, before twisting away at the last minute. Clambering back into the Zodiac dinghy -- or panga, as they're known in the Galapagos -- for the short return trip to the National Geographic Endeavour, one fellow \"explorer\" quizzes our accompanying naturalist. \"Oh, they won't bite you,\" he reassures us. Less reassuringly, he adds: \"Maybe. But just a little.\" All the animals throughout the Galapagos National Park, more than 3,000 square miles of islands and islets 600 miles off Ecuador's mainland, are unperturbed by our presence. As there are no big predators -- or people -- on most of the islands the animals show no fear. And because many species are endemic to the Galapagos or even one of its 13 main islands, there's literally nowhere else in the world that you can have this kind of encounter. Sailing for science . I'm aboard the conservation-focused, naturalist-led Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Endeavour, a ship that lets passengers connect with life both above and below the waves through kayak and Zodiac excursions. Unbelievably, the uninhabited islands are much as Charles Darwin experienced them in 1885. Floreana, the second island on which Darwin landed, still has a \"post office\" that dates back to whaling days when crews would leave mail in a rum barrel. People still leave postcards here to be hand delivered by future visitors (those I addressed to the UK arrived within two weeks via hands unknown). \"It's a land left untamed ... One of the last parts of the world that's really wild,\" says fellow passenger Jim Calaway, an investments portfolio manager from Illinois. Daily recaps and talks by eminent scientists give cruises their characteristic research-meets-education feel. Voyages also have a strong photography slant, with most on-board naturalists certified as photo instructors by National Geographic. On Espanola, we boulder-hop along rough trails to reach an albatross nesting site, often stepping over groups of inky charcoal black marine iguanas. Genovesa's rough, lunar landscape seems inhospitable but teems with seabirds, including half a million red footed boobies -- the largest population in the world. Walking through prickly pear trees along a sandy path to Santa Cruz's aptly named \"Cerro Dragon,\" (Dragon Hill) we spot 28 dusty-yellow-brown Galapagos land iguanas. During that afternoon's ride to the eastern shore of Santa Cruz, dubbed \"El Eden\" for its scenic beauty, naturalist Giancarlo Toti doles out photo tips in time for us to snap a great blue heron feeding its gulping chick. \"I love these cruises because there's always one special thing for everybody,\" says Toti. \"This for me was the most special thing this time -- the heron feeding its chick. I have never seen that before.\" Exploration highlights . Exploring the Galapagos Marine Reserve -- the second largest in the world at more than 50 square miles -- is as integral to the expedition experience as the guided hikes across the islands. On one of the daily snorkel expeditions I spot octopi, manta rays and a solitary Galapagos penguin, puffed up as if to officiate, on various excursions. Although the Endeavour -- named for Captain Cook's former command -- doesn't offer scuba diving, single-day excursions can be arranged with a local operator; it's also the only ship cruising the park with an underwater specialist and a remotely operated vehicle on board. While tourism to the region has tripled in the last 20 years -- just over 200,000 people visited the Galapagos last year -- visitors cruising the islands with responsible operators are helping to correct the damage caused by over hunting and species introduced by sailors, whalers and pirates. Sixty percent of each visitor's $100 entrance fee goes directly to the Galapagos National Park Service, funding rangers, naturalists and conservation work. Expedition leader Paula Tagle says only 84 ships have been allowed in the national park since she began working there in 1997, of which only four are similar in size to the 96-passenger Endeavour. There are strictly enforced park rules -- all visitors must be accompanied by a naturalist and vice versa, with no more than 16 people at any one time -- GNPS also schedules itineraries and landings for every ship to reduce pressure on the islands. The downside of such regimentation is there's no lingering. The upshot is never seeing another ship or any other \"explorers.\" With an ever-growing influx of tourist dollars comes more domestic migration to the Galapagos. Tagle says poorly controlled growth in the inhabited areas and other types of non-cruise tourism are what need attention, rather than the national park area. \"I think 55% of visitors now do the [island hopping] kind of tourism versus 45% that come to the ships to spend the night, like [on the Endeavour]. \"But even more are going to the towns that have grown in a disorganized way,\" she adds. Tortoise breeding . Hearing the story of Lonesome George, the last known of the Pinta Island tortoises and the symbol of the Galapagos (he died at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz in 2012) brings home the importance of the conservation controls. Although George's caretakers are still watching his two female companions in the hope that they might yet lay eggs -- female tortoises can store viable sperm in their bodies for up to three years before fertilizing themselves -- the species is now believed to be extinct. But many initiatives at the Darwin facility have been a success, including a project to revive Espanola's dwindling tortoise population using \"Super\" Diego, an especially virile Espanola tortoise returned to the Galapagos from San Diego Zoo. \"Eighty percent of the center's hatchlings -- so anywhere from 70 to 150 hatchlings a year -- come from Diego and his five girlfriends,\" naturalist Gilda Gonzalez tells me, with a wink. Santa Cruz is also a great place to see giant tortoises in their natural habitat. After a quick stop at a local sugar cane mill -- and a warming tot of the local moonshine -- we arrive at a highland farm, pull on rubber boots and stride off into orchards full of wild tortoises, flattening bushes and bulldozing saplings as they move from one juicy cluster of leaves to the next. Keen eyesight and hearing is not their strong suit -- smell is a giant tortoise's best sense -- so we approach from behind to pose for surreptitious photos as they continue their methodic chomping. It's only when we pass a tortoise close to the path that he notices us and retreats into his shell with a long, deflationary hiss. \"Today we are very lucky to see 11 tortoises -- sometimes there aren't any up here,\" says naturalist Ximena Cordova. \"It takes them three months to come up to the highlands to mate and three months to go back to the lowlands to give birth. These guys are smart -- they're waiting up here for the females to come back.\" For me, seeing these huge hulking carapaces thriving once again in their natural habitat, is one of the most memorable encounters of the trip. \"Conservation is a big theme and every day we talk about results here, results there ... I think it gives hope to people to restore other places,\" says expedition leader Tagle. \"We have a saying -- if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.\" Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic operates 10-day expeditions (a seven-day cruise + transfers) aboard National Geographic Endeavour and National Geographic Islander departing San Cristobal and Baltra, year-round. Cruises are priced from $5,490 per person based on double occupancy, exclusive of international flights and internal flights to Galapagos; +1 212 261 9000."}

Oh and he \"died\" on a football pitch. \"It wasn't like a kaleidoscope -- there was no color, it was all black and white,\" Lutz Pfannenstiel tells CNN, recalling the moment 12 years ago when his life flashed before his eyes, the former goalkeeper suffering an injury which led the club's physio at Bradford Park Avenue to think the German was dead. It's not for nothing the title for Pfannenstiel's book is \"The Unstoppable Keeper.\" Even now, the memory of that day in Bradford, Yorkshire, in north England, is still vivid. \"There were black and white diamonds and it was very quiet,\" said Pfannenstiel, whose lungs collapsed after an opposition player's knee smashed into his chest, preventing him from breathing. \"In the background there were figures but I couldn't make out who they were. I didn't feel cold, I felt all warm. I felt I was floating and it wasn't a scary feeling at all.\" After waking up from the accident and finding himself in hospital, Pfannenstiel screamed at the nurses, convinced he was paralyzed. Raging at the abandonment of the game, in which his team was leading, he was back training within a week. Looking back, he says he behaved \"irresponsibly\" and the incident proved a turning point in Pfannenstiel's career, in which he played for 25 clubs across the globe over two decades. As a youngster, Pfannenstiel was a highly rated player and represented Germany's youth team at Under-17 level. Despite the nation's biggest club Bayern Munich making him an offer, Pfannenstiel opted to pursue his dream of playing abroad. So in 1993 he left Germany to play in Malaysia with Penang FA before eventually moving to England where he enjoyed time in the Premier League with Wimbledon and Nottingham Forest. In South Africa, Pfannenstiel became a folk hero with Orlando Pirates in Johannesburg, his fame even persuading one would be gun toting assailant to apologize for inconveniencing the German as he visited the corner shop for a bottle of water. But it was in Singapore where the most traumatic episode of Pfannenstiel's career would take place after he was accused of conspiring with bookmakers. At the time the German was enjoying life, modeling for Armani and presenting his football highlights show, but he was then found guilty of match fixing and sentenced to 101 days in prison. Protesting his innocence, Pfannenstiel  says he was not charged for match fixing, but for a verbal corrupt agreement. What followed was \"one of the most difficult times\" of his life  as he adjusted to being surrounded by murderers, drug dealers and rapists. \"The prison had no bed, no toilet, no toilet paper, no toothbrush. I slept on the floor,\" he said. \"People were on death row. People got hung. \"For breakfast, they don't say good morning, they punch you in the face. I had to survive in that circus. If it was for 101 days, it felt like 25 years.\" Jail time and his near death experience in England brought about Pfannenstiel's Damascene conversion. Keen to distance himself from what he perceived was a superficial and materialistic way of life, Pfannenstiel came up with  the idea of 'Global United' -- a charity to raise awareness of climate change. It's a project that has prompted Pfannenstiel to invoke the help of several famous footballers such as Zico, Lothar Matthäus and Jari Litmanen. The charity has already run successful events in Africa, particularly Namibia, tackling issues such as HIV/AIDS, famine and education. Now Pfannenstiel hopes to take his football friends, who play in games to raise money, to Antarctica and bring attention to the effects of climate change. He hopes to hold the match at the end of 2015 or early 2016 when the weather is slightly more convivial and use the airport on King George Island as the venue as to ensure the local habitat isn't adversely affected. \"I want to leave the scene as if nothing had ever happened,\" says Pfannenstiel. \"We will clear the airfield using the snowmobiles, use yellow tape for the lines and we will build the nets. \"Within 10 minutes, the nets and lines are gone and nothing will be left. \"I don't want to hear 'this idiot is going there' and he destroyed the natural habitat. There are lots of plants growing around the area and it's very important. \"We will have scientists advising us and if they say we can play elsewhere, fair enough but at the moment, the airfield is the most convenient.\" Having grown up in the Bavarian forests of Germany, Pfannenstiel has always been passionate about the environment. Nature fascinates him and the tranquility and cleanliness of country life remains an integral part of his life. \"If you stand there, you can see the real Antarctica but at the same time, when you look out, you can also see what has happened,\" he says. \"It is already getting greener and that really shouldn't happen. \"Playing in Antarctica makes people think you're playing in the snow and in front of mountains and that's how it was 50 years ago. \"Now it's not like that. The highlands are still white, snowy and icy but the airfield where we will play, is green, brownish and dirty.\" Pfannenstiel has already helped raise awareness of the effects of the climate change by spending a week living in an igloo -- a feat which was streamed online. He hopes to visit the Amazon later this year and spend time living in the treetops in a bid to bring awareness to the destruction being wrought upon the world's rainforests. \"I was born in a village, which is now a ski resort, but it was always beautiful and clean,\" he recalled. \"Whenever I go back to visit my father, everything is so natural. \"When I started to travel, my brain began to scan things and it would compare places like London or any big city to where I grew up. It's filthy. \"If you go to China, the idea of climate change doesn't even seem to register on the conscience. \"If you go to the Maldives, you know that they will be gone in 10-15 years because they'll sink. \"It's a real issue which we want to tackle.\" It's not just the environment which Pfannenstiel is passionate about -- he loves animals too. During his time in Singapore, he owned a pet monkey which caused untold trouble in his apartment. In New Zealand, he had another pet, although one which nearly led to him being deported. Otago, famous for its penguins, became a place of some fascination for Pfannenstiel, who held a long-term admiration for the animal. One night under the cover of darkness, he pulled on a wet suit and temporarily borrowed a penguin to take home with him. \"I saw this penguin and I got so curious and I just adopted him as a pet,\" laughs Pfannenstiel. \"They told me I couldn't do that. So a few days later, I went and got one out. \"I brought him back and put him in a cold bath but he wasn't happy and he really did stink of fish. \"The president of the club came for lunch and he saw that I had the penguin. \"He said it was dangerous and that I could have been deported for having the penguin in the bathtub.\" When not kidnapping penguins or looking to save the world, Pfannenstiel spends his time working for German football Bundesliga club 1899 Hoffenheim. As head of scouting and international relations, he scours the planet looking for talented players which he can bring to the Bundesliga club. He is a football analyst on German television while he has also become more of a feature on the television screens in the United Kingdom. He also works with world governing body FIFA and for the German Football Association as a coaching instructor focusing on educating coaches all over the world. \"I've had to fight for everything since leaving prison,\" he said.  \"When I came back it cost me a fortune. I didn't have that much money -- all I had was a pair of flip flops, a pair of shorts, a T-shirt and a bag full of debts. \"But I can't complain -- at least I'm not dead.\"\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN) -- It's a plot twist that even a thriller writer might have struggled to come up with during Serbia's European qualifying clash with Albania in Belgrade. A drone flying a flag depicting the \"Greater Albania\" over a major international soccer game Tuesday was the subject of a 'whodunnit' mystery after the brother of the Albanian prime minister hit back at allegations by a Serbian government official that he had been piloting the quadcopter. \"I am very disgusted by the allegation of my having any involvement in the piloting of the drone,\" Olsi Rama told CNN Wednesday, who said he had been taking pictures of the game from a VIP suite at the stadium. As a football match mushroomed into a diplomatic incident amid claim and counter-claim in a region of a world that is still riven by ethnic divisions, his version of events conflicted with Serbia's version of events. \"According to the information from the police he (Olsi Rama) was in possession of the navigator,\" said a Serbian official as the country's football federation labeled the drone flight a \"terrorist action planned in advance.\" UEFA has confirmed that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against both teams. The game was abandoned after 41 minutes with players clashing after the flag was taken down by a Serbian player. Rama insisted the police's actions were part of a Serbian \"plot,\" after discovering he was the Albanian prime minister's brother. \"There were 50 or so Albanian guys who can say I didn't have the controller-- they searched everyone.\" The Serbian prime minister's office also stated that Rama was arrested and sent home to Albania, a claim denied by the Albanian government's spokesman. \"There is no proof whatsoever and Olsi Rama was never arrested in Belgrade,\" Endri Fuga, communications director for the prime minister of Albania told CNN. \"He has nothing to do with the drone.\" The contest, played at Partizan's stadium in Belgrade, was abandoned near the end of the first half following ugly scenes involving fans and players. \"When you have 32,000 people shouting kill, kill, kill Albanians, it's living in another dimension,\" said Rama. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. \"What happened last night in Belgrade is truly sad,\" Fuga told CNN. \"The Albanian government firmly condemns the despicable expressions of racism and violence against the Albanian National team players. \"We put all of our trust in UEFA to conduct a fair investigation which sheds light on the truth of all that happened in the Belgrade Stadium, from the start of our national anthem to the very last moment that our squad left the stadium,\" added Fuga referring to European football's governing body. \"Football should never be mixed with politics and state politics cannot be driven by what happens in a football match.\" Fuga believes the scenes witnessed in the Serbian capital offer \"further proof that the ghosts of the past\" that still haunt the Balkans. \"The false story that the Albanian prime minister's brother instigated the showdown of violence by launching a drone carrying a flag over the stadium, is a testament to the presence of harmful elements that wish to keep this region mired in the past,\" said Fuga, who explained Rama was one of a few dozen Albanians who attended the game with valid tickets provided by the country's football association. He says that the group were searched by police but not found to be carrying anything. \"The Albanian Prime Minister remains firmly committed to fostering this new, historical chapter of peace and cooperation,\" said Fuga. \"He will do all in his power to ensure it will not be closed by hatreds such as those which cast such a negative shadow on the football game.\" Rama says that he was moved from the VIP box for security reasons and informed the authorities that he held American citizenship before being given a police escort to waiting buses. \"I tried with my broken Serbian to understand what was happening, but they said this is orders,\" he added. \"I had no involvement in the drone. When the banner came up we had no idea, we thought some Serbians set it up.\" Prime Minister Rama is scheduled to arrive in Belgrade in the next few days -- the first such visit by an Albanian leader in 68 years. In a statement on its website, UEFA said that the match \"was abandoned and the circumstances will be reported to the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body.\" UEFA spokesperson Pedro Pinto told CNN an announcement on sanctions against both countries are expected to be made within a week. Albania's first visit to Belgrade since 1967 was expected to be a tense occasion, though the events of Tuesday evening appeared to catch security authorities by surprise. The \"Greater Albania\" insignia, which was attached to the drone, refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic Albanians reside -- one which would include Kosovo. The two illustrated figures on the flag were Isa Boletini, an Albanian nationalist who led uprisings against the Serbs and Ottomans in 1912 and 1913, while the other, Ismail Qemali, is considered to be the founder of the modern Albanian state, which became independent in 1912. The word \"Autochthonous,\" which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place, was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to Serbians. When Serbian player Stefan Mitrovic ripped the flag down, it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. Martin Atkinson, the English referee, took the players off the field with the game goalless. \"What happened is something we can't comprehend at the moment,\" Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic told reporters following the abandonment. \"On behalf of my team, all I can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the Albanian players every step of the way to the tunnel (after the riot broke out). \"The Albanian team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials and they will now decide the fate of this match. \"We can only regret that football took a back seat but it is difficult to draw any conclusions or make any comments now.\" Security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in Belgrade with away fans prevented from attending amidst heightening tensions over Kosovo -- a majority-Albanian former Serbian province which declared independence in 2008. In 1999, a 78-day air war was launched by NATO to stop the killing off ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces. Kosovo's independence is recognized by many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France -- but not Serbia. Four of Albania's starting lineup were born in Kosovo, with Lorik Cana of Italian club Lazio, goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, midfielder Burim Kukeli and Ermir Lenjani. With Kosovo not recognized as a state by the United Nations, it is unable to join FIFA or UEFA, meaning some of its players have adopted other countries. Xherdan Shaqiri, who plays his club football with Bayern Munich, represents Switzerland as does Valon Behrami and Granit Xhaka. While Kosovo is able to play friendly matches, the team cannot compete in international competition. Belgium-born Adnan Januzaj, one of the most exciting talents in the English Premier League with Manchester United, turned down the opportunity to play for Kosovo, where his father is from. He was also eligible for Albania through his mother's lineage. \"We came to Belgrade to play football, but we were physically attacked by the Serbian supporters,\" Cana told reporters on Tuesday. \"We just wanted to take the flag, and everything would be under control if the stadium security at the stadium had prevented the supporters from attacking our players. \"I was defending my teammate, I have injuries to my face, as does Taulant Xhaka. They asked us to play in front of empty stands (instead of abandonment) -- however, we did not feel good because of our injuries.\" The two countries must now wait for UEFA to make a decision on whether the game should be replayed. and what punishments are handed out. \"It is a regretful situation on which we will report; the referee, myself and the security adviser. The circumstances were such that we couldn't continue the match,\" UEFA's match delegate, Harry Been told reporters. \"You all saw what happened and I cannot comment on who is to blame or what to blame. I will submit a report with my colleagues to UEFA and UEFA will decide what will happen further.\"\n\n**News 3**:\nPresident Barack Obama, flanked by the parents of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at the White House on Saturday, praised the diplomatic officials and troops who helped secure the release of  the American soldier held captive for nearly five years by militants during the Afghanistan war. Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees, officials said. The government of Qatar, which helped broker the release, pledged to \"put in place measures to protect our national security,\" Obama said at the White House Rose Garden. \"While Bowe was gone, he was never forgotten,\" the President said. Bergdahl's mother, Jani, said, \"We will continue to stay strong for Bowe while he recovers.\" Bob Bergdahl said he was not sure whether his son still speaks English and spoke at one point in what appeared to be Pashtun. \"I'm your father, Bowe,\" the father said. Members of the White House national security team -- including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco -- grew emotional when the parents thanked those who helped secure their son's release. Bergdahl, the only remaining U.S. soldier captured during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, was recovered by U.S. special operations forces without incident about 10:30 a.m. ET at a \"pick-up\" point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan, a senior Department of Defense official told CNN. There were 18 armed Taliban members present. Once he was on an American helicopter, Bergdahl, 28, used a paper plate to communicate because of the noise. He wrote, \"SF?\" meaning, \"special forces?\" One of the operators sitting with Bergdahl responded loudly: \"Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time,\" according to the official. Bergdahl broke down crying. 'Cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son' Earlier, the White House said in a statement, \"Today the American people are pleased that we will be able to welcome home Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl.\" Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that he had informed Congress of the decision to transfer five detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl, who was the only remaining American soldier captured from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. After Bergdahl was handed over, a series of secret procedures were set in motion so each side knew the other was living up to the bargain, according to U.S. Defense officials. Qatari officials were already at Guantanamo and took custody of the detainees. They assured the Taliban that the detainees would be flown to Qatar. The Afghan Taliban issued a statement on its website in Arabic and Pashto announcing with \"great happiness and joy\" the exchange of Bergdahl for five of its imprisoned senior leaders. It said, \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was and has been for a long time attempting to free all the imprisoned Afghan prisoners inside and outside the country.\" \"Sgt. Bergdahl is now under the care of the U.S. military after being handed over by his captors in Afghanistan,\" Hagel said. \"We will give him all the support he needs to help him recover from this ordeal, and we are grateful that he will soon be reunited with his family.\" Bergdahl's parents happened to still be in Washington, having visited for Memorial Day. They said in an earlier statement: \"We were so joyful and relieved when President (Barack) Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home! We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. We want to thank Bowe's many supporters in Idaho, around the nation and around the world. We thank the Amir of Qatar for his efforts.  And of course, we want to take this opportunity to thank all those in the many U.S. Government agencies who never gave up. Today, we are ecstatic!\" Secretary of State John Kerry said the \"cost of years of captivity to Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl and his family is immeasurable.\" 'Appropriate assurances' over five detainees . In exchange for Bergdahl's release, five detainees at Guantanamo Bay will be released to Qatar, authorities said. The United States has \"appropriate assurances\" that Qatar will be able to secure the detainees there, where they are under a travel ban for a year. A U.S. Air Force aircraft carrying the detainees left the U.S. Navy base in Cuba on Saturday afternoon, a senior Defense official told CNN. Bergdahl was first transferred to Bagram Airfield, the main U.S. base in Afghanistan, for medical evaluation. \"His health is our number one priority at this time,\" a senior U.S. defense official said. Saturday night, Bergdahl was en route from Bagram to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, a senior defense official told reporters traveling with Hagel. His \"reintegration process\" will include \"time for him to tell his story, decompress, and to reconnect with his family through telephone calls and video conferences. At this time we believe that he will physically reunite with his family in Texas,\" the official said. Hagel said the United States \"coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised.\" The United States believes Bergdahl had been held for the bulk of his captivity in Pakistan, the official said. It was unclear when he was moved to Afghanistan. The U.S. government acknowledged in May 2012 that it was engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. Saturday's transfer was brokered through the local Qatari government, the official said, after talks that began about a week ago. U.S. officials had said this year that one route to getting Bergdahl back was through Qatari officials, who had been talking to the Taliban. But Bergdahl was believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda, and it was not clear whether Haqqani operatives would abide by any agreement among the United States, Qatar and the Taliban. An Afghan Taliban commander, not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed to CNN that Bergdahl was captured by the Afghan Taliban with links to the Haqqani network in Pakistan. Over the years, the captive was transferred back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bergdahl was deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. He was 23 when he was captured by the Taliban after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost on June 30, 2009, in Paktika province. Fast Facts: Bowe Bergdahl . In July of that year, a U.S. military official said the soldier was being held by the clan of warlord Siraj Haqqani. Critics question the negotiations . The United States has long declared that it won't negotiate with groups linked to terrorists, but analysts have said the United States has effectively maneuvered around the edges of that declaration over the years. \"As the administration has repeatedly affirmed, we will not transfer any detainee from Guantanamo unless the threat the detainee may pose to the United States can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy,\" a senior administration official told CNN, adding that the detainees will be \"subject to restrictions on their movement and activities.\" Arizona Sen. John McCain,  a former POW, in a statement called the released detainees \"hardened terrorists who have the blood of Americans and countless Afghans on their hands.\" \"I am eager to learn what precise steps are being taken to ensure that these vicious and violent Taliban extremists never return to the fight against the United States and our partners or engage in any activities that can threaten the prospects for peace and security in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"The American people, and our Afghan partners, deserve nothing less.\" A senior administration official told CNN, \"With regard to whether or not we're negotiating with terrorists: Sergeant Bergdahl is a member of the military who was detained during the course of an armed conflict. The transfer of these individuals is not a concession -- it is fully in line with the President's goal of closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\" The Taliban had long demanded the release of five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But U.S. officials said that releasing them would be difficult because Congress would have to be notified in advance, and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them. NATO leaders signed off last week on Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. Bergdahl, of Wood River Valley, Idaho, appeared in diminished health in a video that the U.S. military obtained in January. His family also received a letter from him last year via the Red Cross.\n\n**News 4**:\n(CNN) -- The flood-engorged Susquehanna River was beginning to crest late Thursday in some Pennsylvania and New York cities, while other communities braced for still higher water levels. Thousands evacuated their homes as the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee moved across already sodden portions of the Northeast, triggering near-historic flooding and leaving at least three people dead. In Luzerne County, in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, between 65,000 and 70,000 people were ordered to leave their homes as the Susquehanna rose above flood stage, according to Emergency Management Coordinator Stephen Bekanich. The levee system was holding late Thursday in Wilkes-Barre, the county seat, a few hours before the river was to crest. As of 9:45 p.m. ET Thursday, the Susquehanna was at 38.83 feet at Wilkes-Barre. Flood stage is 22 feet, according to the National Weather Service.The valley has a levee system that tops out at 41 feet, and the river was projected to crest just shy of that Friday morning, near 40.7 feet, according to Drew McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Wilkes-Barre mayor's office. McLaughlin and other officials were examining the levees. \"We're closely monitoring, and it seems they are holding steady,\" he said. A river gate near the Market Street Bridge was leaking late Thursday, but sandbags and other repairs were keeping it in check, with some minor street flooding in the area, according to McLaughlin. \"It's pretty much a ghost town,\" McLaughlin said from south downtown, adding that residents appeared to heed the call to leave. Other Luzerne County communities not protected by the system were not so fortunate. Heavy flooding was reported in West Pittston, Harding and Plymouth Township. \"At this point, we haven't been able to assess that (flooding and damage) because the water is so high,\" Bekanich said. Plymouth Township resident Francis Federici was forced to leave his home, which sat in 5-foot floodwaters. \"On a normal day, we love it here,\" he said. \"There's nobody around us. We have a beautiful yard. We were fixing our home up.\" \"The rise of the river is so tremendous, we put out a request to volunteers to assist in sandbagging operations,\" Bekanich said. \"We're getting more and more alarmed as the day progresses,\" said Luzerne County Commissioner Maryanne Petrilla, who said the river is now forecast to crest between midnight Thursday and 2 a.m. Friday. Shelter space for 4,100 was rapidly being filled, and the county was looking for more space, Petrilla told CNN. The area from Ithaca to Syracuse to Utica, in New York, and from Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, to Monticello, in Pennsylvania, continued to experience major to record flooding, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. A 71-year-old man died Wednesday night in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, as he was bailing water out of the basement of his home and the walls of the structure caved in, said Chief Patrick O'Rourke of Derry Township Police. A second person drowned early Thursday near Brickerville in Lancaster County, CNN affiliate WGAL-TV reported. A third person died about 4:30 a.m. Thursday in North Lebanon Township, Pennsylvania, police said. A motorist became stranded in high water and was outside the vehicle when struck by another vehicle, which then left the scene. The suspect and that vehicle were found, authorities said. Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, had received an incredible 15.37 inches of rainfall associated with Lee. P&J Pizza, which escaped flooding, did a brisk business Thursday because so many residents couldn't use their kitchens, said employee Sarah Bellia. Many recalled the flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. That storm dumped as much as 18 inches of rain on the area in two days, destroying more than 68,000 homes and 3,000 businesses and leaving 220,000 Pennsylvanians homeless. In Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, CNN iReporter Nick Bohacz said flooded roads prevented him from getting to work. Bohacz, who sent in several photos of the flooding, said he saw a line of people outside a hardware store waiting for supplies. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and other towns won't see a river crest until later Friday. The rising Susquehanna and Chenango rivers were also triggering evacuations in upstate New York, where evacuation orders were issued for portions of Binghamton and the towns of Conklin, Endicott, Johnson City, Union and Vestal, according to CNN affiliate YNN-TV. Numerous cities and counties declared a state of emergency. Video from Johnson City showed a flooded shopping mall and a football field with water nearly up to its goalposts. \"This is a major flooding situation,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. \"This is nothing to trifle with.\" He said he believes flooding will reach historic levels. \"By the time it looks that bad, you won't be able to leave,\" he said. Water was coming over the floodwalls in Binghamton, county spokeswoman Colleen Wagner said. About 15,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 1,400 were in shelters, she said. State officials sent in food and water. A number of boat rescues have taken place, she said, but she did not know how many. The Susquehanna later Thursday crested at 25.71 feet. Broome County Emergency Services Director Brett Chellis urged people in the evacuation areas to leave and not return for now. Water was topping flood walls in Union and Vestal as well as Binghamton, he said. In Otego, New York, about 50 miles northeast of Binghamton, CNN iReporter Don Wyckoff captured footage of water cascading down a road. Wyckoff said he was stunned after watching neighbors and family members lose their homes to the floodwaters. \"You are seeing the tiny mill creek rip out culvert pipes and tearing away roads,\" he said. \"We never thought we would see this again. It happened in 2006, but it is worse now.\" In Oneonta, on the Susquehanna upstream of Binghamton, Police Chief Gary O'Neill said some roads were washed out and parks flooded, but the water appeared to be receding. On the down side, water was flooding the chief's home in Binghamton. Mandatory evacuations were also in place for low-lying areas near Schenectady, New York, YNN said. In neighboring Montgomery County, authorities closed all roads and county buildings until further notice, saying only emergency vehicles would be allowed to travel. The New York State Thruway Authority opened and closed several roads and ramps. In Maryland, areas near Baltimore were also affected. High water blocked dozens of roads in Baltimore County, according to CNN affiliate WMAR-TV. In Anne Arundel County, Maryland, crews found a 49-year-old man in floodwaters, CNN affiliate WBL reported. The man died at a hospital. The circumstances of his death were not clear Thursday evening. Port Deposit, Maryland, about 45 miles northeast of Baltimore along the Susquehanna, ordered an evacuation of the town's 800 residents by 8 p.m. Thursday. The Prince George's County, Maryland, Fire and EMS Department said it was responding to numerous emergency calls, and nearly two dozen people had been rescued or helped by firefighters and the department's swift-water team. Because the system is slow-moving, \"I'm afraid it's going to get worse before it gets better,\" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. Several rounds of heavy rain are in store for much of the region the next couple of days, with an additional 2 to 6 inches forecast -- and in isolated cases as much as 10 inches, according to the National Weather Service. The rain comes on top of the heavy precipitation that has fallen in the region from Irene. What's left of Lee has stalled across the central Appalachian Mountains. Rainfall totals through 2 p.m. Thursday included 11.66 inches in Waldorf, Maryland; 8.23 inches at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland; 9.55 inches in Phillipsburg, New Jersey; 10.08 inches in Binghamton; 14.7 inches in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania; 13.3 inches in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. CNN's Sarah Dillingham, Ines Ferre, Mary Snow, Scott Thompson and Jesse Solomon contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7509, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- Even for an employed schoolteacher like Narinder, it is hard to find a bride these days. Narinder is a shy, slender 36-year old with a certain anxiety about him -- as if he has resigned to a fate that he is unable to change. He is very polite and at first, reluctant to talk about his situation. Narinder is one of four sons and only one of his brothers has managed to get married. In his district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, there are only 858 girls born for every 1,000 boys, a ratio that doesn't occur naturally without medical intervention. The northwestern state of Uttar Pradesh is home to one of the largest skewed sex ratios in India. INFOGRAPHIC: India's gender gap . \"Only the rich and men with government jobs manage to get a bride these days,\" he says. \"Anyone who earns less cannot find a bride here anymore.\" In India's conservative society, remaining a bachelor is not an option. A new bride would help his parents, he says. \"They would have had an easier life. They would have had someone to cook and to take care of them.\" She should clean. She should run the household. She should bear children. And Narinder plans to share her with his two unmarried brothers, who live in the same house. But he cannot find a bride in his village, where so few exist. So, he contacted an agent to find one from another state. Narinder may be a victim of the heavily-skewed male sex ratio in his community; more broadly, the desire to buy a bride is also fueling bride trafficking. Decades of sex-selective abortion have created an acute lack of women in certain parts of India. Traffickers capitalize on the shortage by recruiting or kidnapping women ensnared in poverty to sell as brides. It's a cycle influenced by poverty and medical technologies, but one that ultimately is perpetuated by India's attitude towards women. India grapples with rape and sexual violence . Where India's trafficked brides come from . Across the country, in the northeastern state of Assam, the sobs of a couple fill a hut made of mud and bamboo. An aging couple cannot hold back their tears when they look at a passport-sized image of a dark-haired teenager, whose expression is washed out by water spots. This faded photo is all what's left of Jaida, their 16-year-old daughter. Jaida's family ended up in the village of mud houses at a safe distance from the Brahmaputra River, after floods had destroyed their livelihood. The family retains a few of their possessions: pots, pans, a few goats and two Indian daybeds. They had no access to farmland and Jaida's father earned a living by weaving baskets and mats out of straw. Jaida disappeared more than two years ago from their makeshift settlement along the Brahmaputra River. She was last seen talking to a stranger on a rainy day. Her parents' hopes rest with Shafiq Khan, a human rights activist, who has come to find out why more than 3,000 women went missing in the state of Assam in 2012. The National Crime Records Bureau estimated in 2012 that about 10 women are kidnapped in Assam every day. Some of these women are found again. Some go missing forever. Eastern Indian states like Assam, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha turn into source areas for bride trafficking, because they have much more balanced sex ratios. Meanwhile, India's northwestern states are more conservative and also more affluent, meaning they're able to afford ultrasound scans and selective abortions. Halida, a 14-year-old girl, lives in a neighboring village, near Jaida's family. In December 2012, as a violent gang rape in Delhi shocked the world, Halida was fetching water when she was kidnapped by a man on a motorbike. He took Halida to a house, locked her up and raped her over two days. Only when the man said that he would sell her in Delhi, did Halida muster the courage to escape. Opinion: India can learn respect for women . While Halida managed to escape her captor, she could not escape the blame her community cast on her. When her village found out about the attack, children started to tease her, making school a nightmare. Nobody would hire her father, a day-laborer, so he has to venture ever further afield in search of work. During the interview, Halida's mother sat quietly in a corner, but didn't hide her opinions: That her daughter had brought shame on the whole family. Shafiq Khan, the human rights advocate, says there is a cruel logic to this: Rape is a means for the trafficker to exert power over their victims. And the social stigma attached to rape puts the victim in an even more vulnerable situation. India's northeastern states have all the ingredients for turning poor women into traffickers' prey. The question is why? Opinion: Where have India's females gone? When everyone wants a son . India's preference for sons transcends all religions and castes. \"As fertility declines, people choose not only the number of children they have, but also choose the sex of the child,\" says Poonam Muttreja, a prominent campaigner for women's rights and an adviser to the government. \"And everyone wants a son.\" The skewed sex ratio is due to what Puneet Bedi, a Delhi suburb gynecologist, calls \"mass murder on an unprecedented scale.\" Census data shows some districts in India have fewer than 800 girls born for every 1,000 boys, leaving male-heavy villages. A maverick amongst India's medical community, Bedi accuses his colleagues of helping parents use ultrasound scans to determine the sex of the baby and abort females, because of a cultural preference for sons. If this practice doesn't stop, Bedi fears the worst for the future of India. \"The social fabric of society we accept as normal is unimaginable when a good 20 or 30% of the women are missing,\" he says. Opinion: How terrible is it to be born a girl? Why such a strong preference for sons exists is a matter of heated debate. Some point out that it is expensive to marry off daughters, because of the practice of dowry. Although dowry is outlawed in India, this practice persists. Others maintain that daughters only look after their in-laws, instead of their birth parents, when they grow old. Muttreja calls this pure myth. Women have been shown to be much more reliable when it comes to looking after relatives or using their earnings responsibly, she says. \"While working women send money back to their families, men hold back money for liquor, cigarettes and perhaps going to sex workers, too,\" she says. The middle-class especially selects for sons, suggesting that economic development isn't likely to solve the problem, according to recent census data. When brides are sold . Although women are outnumbered by men in northwestern states, trafficked brides do not arrive into their new homes as prized wives. They have a name for the purchased brides -- paro -- which is derogatory for foreigner or stranger. We met 32 of them in a village of less than 1,000 people in the northeastern state of Haryana. Tasleema and her sister Akhleema are originally from Kolkata. Their family was so poor, they decided to sell them to a trafficker. The sisters are married to two brothers in a dusty village in Haryana. During their childhood in Kolkata, they recalled, on a few lucky days, there was money to go to the cinema. After being sold as brides, their lives are spent cooking, cleaning and working in the fields. They tell us of beatings and abuse. \"Even the village children talk to us like dogs,\" the sisters say. Faced with the allegations, the husbands maintain they paid more than $2,000 to traffickers, before they married the sisters. They emphasize that the men are stigmatized too, because they didn't manage to find a bride locally and instead had to buy one of the \"paro\" women. \"Patriarchy is so entrenched in our society. Girls are unwelcome visitor(s) in our own homes, and that's how they are treated,\" says Muttreja, the activist. The men and women alike speak of their situation with surprising frankness. The public outrage after the Delhi rape case has shown India's ability for self-criticism and the willingness of a significant part of its society to leave behind a deeply entrenched patriarchy. But this vicious cycle of aborting girls, kidnapping women and selling off brides continues -- the byproduct of a culture that sees sons as a blessing and daughters as a curse.\n\n**News 2**:\nIt's late in Iran on a dark night, moonless or with heavy clouds. Suddenly the silence is broken by sonic booms, followed by the sound of jets roaring overhead. Flying in tight formation, Israeli fighter planes drop bunker-busting bombs on a nuclear enrichment plant built into the side of a mountain. Iranian pilots race for their own jets to fight back, but by the time they take to the sky, it's too late. The Israeli jets streak away. That, at least, is what Israel would like to happen if it decides to attack Iran in an effort to prevent it from acquiring the ability to make nuclear weapons. But would it be as easy for Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear sites as it was for the Jewish state to strike an Iraqi reactor in 1981 or a suspected one in Syria five years ago? Experts inside and outside Israel say no. They envision a much more complicated attack, one that would involve more than 100 planes -- from fighters to refueling tankers -- flying hundreds of miles to bomb up to eight targets around Iran. Possible site of Iran explosive tests identified, think tank says . Israel hit one target each in Iraq and Syria, but Iran's nuclear assets are spread over multiple sites in different parts of the country. One is buried under concrete. Another is dug into a mountain. Surface-to-air missiles and electronic warfare systems protect them all. They also are significantly farther away from Israel than the targets in Iraq or Syria. And they may not be the only sites Israel would need to destroy to achieve its goal. Bombing Iranian nuclear facilities would be \"very complicated,\" said Ephraim Kam, deputy director of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. \"It is a very large-scale operation, much greater than the one carried out in Iraq 30 years ago,\" said Kam, a former colonel who served with an intelligence research division in the Israeli military. Israel would most likely attack Iran with fighters jets -- the F-15I and the F-16I -- rather than missiles fired from submarines, Kam and other experts said. \"In order to create proper damage to the nuclear plants, you need extremely accurate weapons,\" Kam said. \"I don't know that the missiles are accurate enough.\" According to the London-based defense analysis group Jane's, Israel has one squadron -- about 25 planes -- of F-15I jets, which are similar to the F-15 Eagle fighters of the U.S. Air Force. Israel calls its version of the fighter Raam, or Thunder. It has four squadrons of F-16Is, the Israeli version of the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Israeli jet is known as the Suefa, or Storm. The Israeli fighters lack the range to reach most of the likely targets in Iran, so Israel would also need to put tanker aircraft into the sky, said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Israel has at least seven KC-707 tankers that it could use for airborne refueling, Barrie said. It also has at least four KC-130H tankers, versions of the giant Hercules aircraft, but is not likely to use them because their slow speed means the jets would need to slow down to link with them, wasting fuel, he said. The strike aircraft would carry bunker-busting GBU-28 bombs -- 5,000-pound bombs to \"go after hardened and buried sites,\" Barrie said. Each F-15I could carry up to three bunker-busters, he said, depending on whether they are configured to carry the maximum number of bombs or the largest possible amount of fuel. The American military has an even larger bunker-buster, the 30,000-pound GBU-57, but there's \"no indication the Israelis have requested that weapon\" or that Israel has the B-2 or B-52 bombers needed to deliver it, Barrie said. Like other experts, he based his analysis on the assumption that if Israel mounted an attack, it would do so without American help. There would be at least four primary targets, said Emily Chorley, a nuclear expert at Jane's: the Natanz and Fordo nuclear enrichment plants, the Esfahan uranium conversion facility, and the Arak nuclear complex. Esfahan and Arak are above ground and are \"relatively vulnerable to aerial attack,\" she said. But Natanz, in the center of the country, is buried under 33 feet of earth and 6 feet of concrete, Chorley said, making it \"very hard to penetrate.\" Fordo, near the holy city of Qom, is \"even more difficult\" because it is deeply buried in a mountain, she said. Dropping a bunker-busting bomb on Fordo actually might make it less vulnerable, Chorley said, since collapsing the entrance without destroying the facility would protect it from further bombing. \"It's questionable whether Israel is capable of destroying it in an air-launched attack,\" she said. \"Just getting Natanz and Arak without getting Fordo wouldn't be worth the risk,\" she argued, since Fordo is enriching uranium to higher levels than the other sites. All four targets are protected by S-200 and Hawk surface-to-air missile batteries, said Chorley's colleague, Jim O'Halloran, a specialist in land-based air defense. Israel would have at least two secondary targets as well, Chorley predicted -- the Tabriz and Imam Ali missile bases in the west, \"to prevent a retaliatory missile attack\" on Israel. It also could try to strike the controversial Parchin military base east of Tehran, which inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency have been trying to visit, Chorley said. Israel also might target the Bidganeh military base, which suffered a mysterious explosion in November. That would bring the number of potential targets to eight. Iran's single declared civilian nuclear reactor probably is safe, Chorley said. An attack on the Bushehr reactor would risk spreading nuclear contamination, and could mean killing Russian personnel at the Russian-built facility, infuriating Moscow. Israel has three potential routes of attack, according to Jane's and other experts, assuming its fighters do not fly all the way around the Arabian Peninsula. Jane's says the Israeli Air Force does not have enough refueling capacity to travel that distance. The northern route would go through Turkey, with which Israel has tense relations. The southern route would go through Saudi Arabia, which fears its rival Iran getting a bomb but is openly hostile toward Israel. The central route is the shortest. It runs through Jordan and Iraq. Jordan and Israel are at peace, but there's no guarantee Jordan would formally give Israel permission to fly over its territory. Iraqi air defenses, meanwhile, \"cannot prevent violations of sovereignty,\" said Charles Hollosi of IHS Jane's. That makes it the \"most likely location for air refueling.\" Israel will need to decide what altitude its planes would fly at on the way in. Flying higher would protect them from the defenses of the countries they fly over, but will expose them sooner to Iranian radar. \"You're going to be in the cockpit three hours-plus before you get to the target unless you go the central route,\" said Barrie, the International Institute for Strategic Studies' senior fellow for military aerospace in London. He doubts the Iranians would be able to detect them coming that far away. \"I don't imagine them having two hours' notice. The Israelis will be desperate to give them as little notice as possible. \"They will try to ensure their aircraft remain below their radar as long as possible,\" he said. \"If you're in an Israeli fast jet you don't want it to be anything like a fair fight.\" Barrie noted the Israeli military's success in attacking a suspected nuclear site in Syria in 2007. \"The Israelis, with a mix of electronic warfare and electronic attack, degraded Syrian air defenses to the point where they didn't see the strike package coming in,\" he said. \"Can the Israelis pull off tactical surprise the way they did with the Syrians in 2007? Going after three or four strike targets is much harder,\" he said. Iran's air force has American-made F-14 Tomcats acquired under the shah's regime, which ended in 1979, Barrie said, as well as Russian-made MiG-29s. On paper, they are not a match for the Israeli planes. \"Israel remains the pre-eminent air force in the region -- well-equipped, and they have trained long and hard,\" he said. \"The Iranians are at an obvious disadvantage in terms of the age and quality of the equipment they have, but they also train hard and will be motivated,\" Barrie said. \"I would be surprised if the Israelis are underestimating the Iranians.\"\n\n**News 3**:\nAt first, Felisha Archuleta thought her young son's affinity for wearing dresses, primping his hair and playing with Barbies and Bratz dolls indicated he was going through a stage. But Bobby Montoya's interest in \"girl stuff\" has not been short-lived: He's grown his hair out and has dressed as a girl when he can for much of his 7 years. Bobby's been \"outspoken\" about his gender identity, said Archuleta. The Denver, Colorado, family's recent attempt to sign up Bobby with Girl Scouts, however, left him in tears, his mother said. A leader said he could not join because of his \"boy parts,\" Archuleta told CNN affiliate 9News. The Girl Scouts of Colorado has since said it was an \"inclusive\" organization and \"if a child lives life as a girl\" he or she is welcome to join. \"When a family requests membership for their daughter, we do not require proof of gender, we respect the decisions of families.\" Archuleta doesn't label her son, who has been bullied and taunted. \"I consider Bobby to be born in the wrong body.\" The Colorado case has brought to light questions about labels and the rapidly evolving discussion about gender non-conforming children. \"A person is going to be who they are going to be,\" said Boston-based family therapist Terry Real. \"These children are operating in a hostile environment. As a parent, you are navigating a child in two poles -- authentic to their feelings, the other being on the brunt end of ill treatment.\" Despite the uphill battle, psychologists and therapists speak of a \"sea change\" toward growing acceptance of children who don't meet long-held cultural norms. And, they point out, families have more resources to learn about gender variance, including websites and peer and support groups. It can be a complicated discussion, especially when terms like tomgirl, gender fluid or transgender are bandied about. The terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, particularly on official forms, but sociologists say they are not the same thing. Sex refers to biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women. Gender refers to socially constructed roles and behaviors society considers appropriate for men and women. Gender identity and sexual orientation also are different. Sexual orientation refers to an individual's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity refers to one's internal sense of being male, female, or something else, according to the American Psychological Association. Transgender children and adults are \"people who are being assigned one gender but affirm that they are the other,\" said Diane Ehrensaft, a San Francisco Bay Area developmental and clinical psychologist and author of \"Gender Born, Gender Made.\" There is little consistent advice for parents, because robust data and studies about transgender children are rare. The rates of people who are transgender vary from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000, depending on various international studies. Gender non-conforming children who do not receive support from their families are at higher risk for mental health issues, attempted suicide and drug use, said Real, citing research at the Family Acceptance Project. In some cases, parents should strongly consider working with a gender-sensitive therapist, he said. \"They have experience in helping a child and parent with difficult decisions,\" Real said. \"Things like disclosure, how do you talk about it, do you wear your hair long. ... It is the responsibility of the parent to deal with the needs of this child. There are minute-to-minute questions.\" The Family Acceptance Project, based at San Francisco State University, has produced videos to support families of transgender children. Research has shown  that a high proportion of lesbians, gays and bisexuals are gender non-conforming, said Caitlin Ryan, director of the center. People can be gender non-conforming and heterosexual, she adds. Ryan said parents of non-conforming children should learn more about neighborhood schools. \"Parents need to find out what the school policies are,\" Ryan said. \"Do the teachers have training? Is the school environment overall supportive?\" But experts also said parents must be prudent. \"In some cultures it may not be safe to send your boy to a school in a dress. You can work with schools,\" said Ehrensaft. '\"Support would be to tell the child it is an unfair world and there may be some places it is not safe to be who you want to be. It is not your fault, it is their fault.\" Sarah Hoffman, a writer and activist in the Bay Area, blogs about \"parenting a boy who is different.\" The writer, who said she uses a pseudonym to protect the safety of her family, said her son, Sam, 9, represents the gender spectrum -- one foot in the masculine world, one foot in the feminine. For that, she said, her son has endured bullying. Sam sees himself as a boy but has liked tiaras and dresses, Hoffman said. While he has long hair, Sam now usually wears masculine clothes. \"He is just a mix,\" Hoffman told CNN. \"The problem is not our kids,\" Hoffman said. \"The problem is our culture not accepting kids.\" Hoffman said some readers have called her a weak parent for letting Sam express himself. Ehrensaft said she has received e-mails from critics telling her to read the Bible and \"see God's way.\" Ehrensaft and Ryan said they have assisted people who are socially and religiously conservative. \"We help them balance their beliefs with what is happening with their child,\" said Ryan. In general, fathers have a harder time accepting gender variance than mothers, experts say. And the culture more often raises eyebrows when a boy dresses as a girl than when a girl looks masculine. \"Girls have more license to express a range of gender presentations until they get into junior high,\" said Ryan. By then, they are expected to be interested in boys. The researcher and others stress the importance of parents paying close attention to children showing gender non-conformity. \"They know what feels right to them. They know what clothes they want to wear,\" Ryan said. \"They very clearly know who they are.\" Parents need to be careful not to rush to a diagnosis and predict a child's eventual sexual orientation or gender identity, experts said. For example, a child dressed in drag may be depressed and looking for attention -- but not have a gender issue. \"You have to live in a state of not knowing for a while,\" said Ryan. \"They are exploring their gender. The most important thing is to give them space for exploration. If you categorize them at age 3, that could be a big mistake.\" Families also should be aware of what may lie ahead, Real said. There could be discussion of delayed puberty and hormone therapy to decrease certain anatomical attributes. Joel Baum, director of education and training at Gender Spectrum, which promotes an \"inclusive environment,\" said \"more and more families are seeing their children express themselves a little differently from what others believe. They are kind of saying, 'I am going to see where this goes.'\" \"We don't talk about the damage we do when we don't allow a kid to explore this aspect of self,\" Baum said. Not everyone is happy with that approach. Regina Griggs, executive director of Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays, a group that works with people who no longer practice gay, lesbian or transgender lifestyles, said of transgender individuals: \"If they aren't helped to celebrate their true gender they will be confused.\" Gender confusion can be sign of a treatable mental disorder, according to Griggs. The American Psychiatric Association is reviewing its current definition of gender identity disorder. Whether a person has a disorder is dependent on how much mental distress it causes, according to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, composed of doctors, psychologists and others professionals. Simply dressing in a non-traditional way does not mean the person has a disorder. Ehrensaft stressed parents need to become resilient to critics. \"I'm not letting my child do something,\" parents might state, she says. \"I am listening to who my child is.\" Felisha Archuleta, who has two older children, said Bobby is still interested in joining the Girl Scouts, but not the same unit he first came in contact with. The Girl Scouts of Colorado is taking such situations \"on a case by case basis,\" said spokesperson Rachelle Trujillo. \"This is a pretty new thing for us.\" \"I have absolutely heard of many situations of transgender kids who are absolutely living as a girl. Girl Scouts shouldn't be any different for them,\" she said. Archuleta said her son doesn't need counseling and does not the dress the way he does because of his environment. \"I know it's going to be a really hard road for Bobby,\" Archuleta said. \"I feel if we are there for him, we will get through it together.\"\n\n**News 4**:\nAbby Rodgers walked out to her date's car and found roses, a teddy bear and a card sitting in the passenger's seat. Inside the card was the million-dollar question: Will you go to prom with me? The 17-year-old high school senior was touched. Everyone at her all-girls private school in suburban Philadelphia was hoping for some sort of \"promposal,\" the act of inviting someone to prom in an elaborate fashion, often involving props, dancing flash mobs or maybe even police or actor Bryan Cranston. In the moment, Rodgers said yes, \"because it was such a nice gesture and he was so sweet and brave to go through with it.\" Later that evening, when she had a chance to process what had happened, she realized she didn't actually want to go with him. \"I realized that prom is more of a couples atmosphere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to be there with someone I was not in a close relationship with.\" While prom is a great excuse to dress up, party with friends and mark the passage of another school year, the annual rite of passage also carries a lot of pressure -- to look perfect, arrive in style and have the ideal date on your arm. Promposals can add to the pressure, becoming almost as important as prom itself and raising expectations for young men and women, especially when they get posted on social media for all to see. Sure, some promposals can be thoughtful, charming or downright heartwarming. They can teach teens to take healthy risks and nurture their romantic side in the hookup-culture era. But, as with anything, it's all about intention. \"As promposals have become more elaborate and public, so, too, does the potential for increased humiliation and social pressure,\" said Jarrod Chin, director of training and curriculum of Northeastern University Sport in Society, a nationwide youth mentoring program that focuses on violence prevention and healthy relationships. \"As promposal clips go viral, more and more young people think that you need to create these elaborate schemes to ask someone to prom and the reality is that it should be just a fun event for young people to dance and celebrate.\" Going all out and all in . What used to be a potentially awkward phone call or hallway conversation is becoming an extremely public ceremony with high stakes. For some girls (and, even some boys), not getting a promposal is their worst nightmare. And yet, being approached with flowers in the hallway can be a letdown, especially if a friend was serenaded in a flash mob. For others, these grandiose public gestures put invitees on the spot, forcing them to accept even if they don't want to for fear of being perceived as mean or stuck up. Opinion: The damaging message of proms . Boys also face pressure to be creative and do whatever it takes to get a yes. That's the whole point, after all. Sometimes, the effort comes from a genuine desire to make the invitee happy and have fun doing it. Other times, the point really is to force a yes. Massachusetts high school senior Sam Casey has seen it go both ways. Friends in relationships have staged promposals for the fun of it. He's also seen classmates do them in front of invitees' families to get a yes where they probably would not have received one otherwise. \"It takes a lot for a guy to put himself out there for a girl, and they want to do everything they can to make sure they're not humiliated,\" he said. \"By doing it in a special way, or publicly showing that he really wants to go with that person, 99% of the time the girl will say yes.\" Either way, it can be a source of stress for both sides, Casey said. \"I think it's gotten to the point that if you don't do it, you'll have a hard time finding a date,\" he said. If the answer is no, the emotional fallout can be damaging, Chin said. Programs such as Sport in Society's Mentors in Violence Prevention work with teens nationwide on how to have mature conversations with potential love interests and how to deal with a breakup or rejection. \"If their identity could potentially be challenged by a 'no' to prom, we need to provide young men with the skills and ability to handle what could be a really embarrassing and traumatic public refusal,\" Chin said. That's where parents and adults come in, he said, to talk about realistic expectations around prom dating in general. \"As adults, we shouldn't minimize promposals or teen relationships as puppy love or harmless crushes,\" he said. \"Instead, we should view (them) as the first steps in developing intimate relationships, and how they handle them sets the stage for more complicated situations, like long-term dating, breakups, marriage and divorce.\" Testing the waters . Not all promposals are bad or ill-intentioned. To avoid potential embarrassment or hurt feelings, teens often put out feelers among friends to see if their potential date is interested. In best-case scenarios, the person knows what's coming; it's just a matter of how and when, said University of Pennsylvania freshman Ria Desai. \"I didn't feel any pressure to say yes because I already knew he was going to ask me,\" said Desai, who accepted a promposal in 2012 from a close friend during dance class. \"In that way it was fun because I didn't know how he was going to ask me; it was a surprise.\" Promposals get iffy when the other person has no clue as to what's coming, she said. In those situations, some girls say yes in the moment but then later turn down the guy in private. The alternative of public rejection can be worse for the girl, Desai wrote in a 2012 blog post for SPARK Summit, a girl-fueled activist movement that challenges media portrayals of women. \"Turning him down marks her as a 'huge bitch,' a label she doesn't deserve in any way. Yes, rejecting him will hurt his feelings, but doesn't every girl deserve the chance to make the decision that she wants to make?\" she wrote. Further raising the stakes, though, is the \"necessity\" of capturing the event as a picture or video so it can be shared on social media, said Ohio State University freshman Melinda Vercollone, whose 2013 promposal came in the form of a \"prom\" sign underneath the hood of a friend's car. Her twin sister got asked when a boy showed up at their home shirtless on a moped with roses in his mouth while his friends filmed the whole thing. \"The filming was important; it's sort of a necessity to put something on Facebook or Instagram so everyone will know who asked who and when and how. It's also critical that everyone watches the video so the next boy doesn't accidentally copy a proposal that has already been done,\" Vercollone said. \"I remember being so happy that I was asked to prom, but also so disappointed that no one had been there to see it or to take a cute picture of us and post it on Facebook.\" The pressure to couple up . Rodgers, the suburban Philadelphia teen, has nothing against promposals, especially among friends and couples. They have great potential to be sweet or thoughtful when done the right way. That's what caught her off guard about her date's promposal. They knew each other through mutual friends, but she knew in her heart that she did not want to bring someone she was not serious about to prom. She discovered this at her junior prom, when she brought a guy she didn't know well because she didn't want to be the only person without a date. They didn't really hit it off. \"I realized I would rather go alone or with my friends,\" she said. This year, Rodgers faced pressure from various corners to bring someone. Even her grandparents offered to attempt to set her up with a busboy from their favorite restaurant. \"It's almost taboo at my school to go alone.\" Inspired by a friend who decided not to bring a date, Rodgers texted her date two weeks after his promposal and told him she changed her mind. He took it well, she said, and he found another date for his prom. Rodgers ended up going to hers without a date last week. She had a great time dancing and posing for pictures with her friends, including others who went alone. \"It was amazing. I have no regrets,\" she said. \"To girls who get promposed to and don't know what to do, I would just say you only have one prom. Think about what's going to make you happy and remain true to who you are.\""}

Highlights from the Clinton documents . Do your own review with the CNN document reader . Some of the confidential memos, notes and other papers released by the National Archives referred to technological advances of the times, such as the 1995 memo that suggested then first lady Hillary Clinton use the Internet to speak to young women because it \"has become very popular.\" Others detailed political battles over health care reform that sounded like today's headlines. \"The Republican alternative, as it appears now to be shaping up, at least among the moderate Republicans in the Senate, is an individual mandate, we have looked at that in every way we know how to,\" said Hillary Clinton's notes from a 1993 meeting with Democratic leaders in Congress. \"That is politically and substantively a much harder sell than the one we've got -- a much harder sell.\" Health care wars of old . We now know that the Clinton plan for employers to provide health coverage for workers failed to pass back then, and the individual mandate -- requiring people to obtain health insurance -- is the foundation of the 2010 Obamacare reforms passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress with zero Republican votes. From the same meeting with congressional Democrats, Clinton wrote that \"it may be an unpleasant fact for some of us Democrats to face, but the argument is not going to (be) won on bringing in the uninsured.\" President Barack Obama and Democrats now face relentless criticism from Republicans over changes in policies and costs forced on some consumers by the 2010 reforms, rather than the requirement that the previously uninsured get coverage. Clinton's words from two decades ago now sound prescient. \"The argument is going to be won,\" she wrote, on keeping coverage \"for everybody, including those who are insured, but may not be next year or the year after.\" In another memo from 1994, an aide to President Bill Clinton warned against using a line in the upcoming State of the Union address about his administration's health care proposal that said: \"You'll pick the health plan and the doctor of your choice.\" \"This sounds great and I know that it's just what people want to hear, but can we get away with it?\" wrote White House Staff Secretary Todd Stern. Noting that the thrust of the Clinton reforms was to steer people toward \"cheaper, HMO-style providers,\" Stern added that he worried about \"getting skewered for overpromising here on something we know full well we won't deliver.\" Today, Obama gets skewered for similar claims he made during the health care debate 15 years later that turned out to be exaggerated or plain wrong, such as his \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" statement that earned him \"Lie of the Year\" by the fact-checking website PolitiFact. Clinton OK with Obamacare fixes . Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, faces no apparent bombshells from the 3,546 pages of archival documents made public Friday. Can Clinton tap Obama's magic in South Carolina? It was the first batch of more than 30,000 pages eligible for release after a 12-year waiting period under the Presidential Records Act, with more to be made public in March. First digital age presidential candidate . \"So far, and underlining so far because we're still going through the documents, absolutely nothing\" amounting to a game-changer for Clinton, said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. At the same time, he noted Clinton would be the first presidential candidate of the digital age with still unpublicized documentation dating back to her eight years in the White House as first lady. \"There's never been a candidate that we think we know so well, but yet there's this huge resource of information where we still might learn things,\" King said. The new documents showed a first lady pushed by her aides to be more open and accessible to the public. In the 1995 memo by Press Secretary Lisa Caputo, suggestions included a guest appearance on the ABC TV show \"Home Improvement\" and using the then-young Internet to connect to young women, noting that \"Internet has become a very popular mode of communication.\" Four years later, adviser Mandy Grunwald offered \"style pointers\" in a memo for listening tour Clinton did after creating an exploratory committee for her Senate campaign in New York. \"Don't be defensive. Look like you want the questions. The press is obviously watching to see if they can make you uncomfortable or testy. Even on the annoying questions, give relaxed answers,\" Grunwald wrote. She also added that Clinton should \"look for opportunities for humor\" because \"it's important that people see more sides of you, and they often see you only in very stern situations.\" Adviser in 1999: Try to be funny . Grunwald also advised Clinton to avoid laying claim on the record of her husband's administration, saying \"this trip is about you, and you are not an incumbent.\" One more tip from Grunwald: be prepared to be asked if she ever used drugs. With the potential for politically volatile details in the documents, groups trying to bolster or harm Clinton's possible presidential ambitions made clear they would be having a look. America Rising, a pro-Republican opposition research shop, told CNN that \"we'll be poring through them,\" with a person on ground in Arkansas for that purpose. Rubio on 2016: Clinton would 'struggle' Correct the Record, a pro-Democratic group with deep ties to the Clinton family, also told CNN it would have a team going over the new information. Dem groups already at work for 2016 . Heavy demand appeared to disable the website of the William J. Clinton Presidential Library for some users in the first minutes after the documents were released on Friday afternoon. In total, approximately 25,000 pages of new documents, including confidential communications between President Bill Clinton and his top advisers, will be released over the next two weeks. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, they became eligible for release in January 2013, 12 years after Clinton's presidency ended. \"When those restrictions expired, (the National Archives and Records Administration) then provided notification of our intent to disclose these Presidential records to the representatives of President Obama and former President Clinton in accordance with Executive Order 13489, so that they may conduct a privilege review of the records,\" the National Archives said in a written statement. \"As they complete their review, NARA is able to make the records available.\" More documents coming . An additional 8,000 pages are undergoing a further month-long review per a directive from the White House and will not be available for release prior to March 26. The documents in question were part of files that had been requested for public release over the years under the Freedom of Information Act, but were withheld due to their sensitive nature. While the Presidential Records Act established public ownership of White House documents as far back as the Reagan Administration, it defined six categories of records that could be withheld for the 12-year period. They include classified national security information, confidential business information and trade secrets, and unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. Documents pertaining to federal appointments and confidential communications, so-called \"P2\" and \"P5\" exemptions, also fall under the 12-year protection of the act. After the 12-year mark from the end of a presidential administration, the records are subject to the same restrictions as spelled out in the Freedom of Information Act, with one key exception. Congress excluded presidential records from exemptions based on executive privilege. However, since the passage of the law, Presidents Reagan, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have each issued executive orders clarifying the process under which an incumbent president or former president could assert executive privilege to prevent the release of documents. The new releases will not be the first from the Clinton archives. The library routinely releases records in response to FOIA requests, although a sizable backlog exists. Freedom of Information Act requests . Records were also released during the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan, who worked as a White House lawyer during the Clinton administration, and also as a result of ongoing legal action from the conservative group Judicial Watch. Interest in the often unglamorous world of archival research has spiked due to the possible presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state in Obama's first term. Earlier this month, CNN reviewed papers from a former confidante of the Clintons, Diane Blair, that offered some revealing personal glimpses of Hillary Clinton during her years as first lady. Blair was counselor, friend for Hillary Clinton . CNN document reader: Read from the Blair papers .\n\n**News 2**:\nSheryl Sandberg is a role model, say her defenders. The chief operating officer of Facebook earned two degrees from Harvard and spent the early part of her career in public service, rising to become chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers during the latter days of the Clinton administration. She helped build Google into a powerhouse; she has led the Facebook team in making the social media site ubiquitous. She's a mother who cares deeply about work-life balance and has been outspoken about women pulling together. Sheryl Sandberg is no role model, say her detractors. She's glided to the top thanks to the help of powerful men, whether it's the patronage of Summers, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt or Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. She's worth hundreds of millions of dollars, lives in an exclusive Bay Area suburb with a staff of minders and knows as much about being a working mother as a Pacific Heights socialite. One thing's for sure: Sheryl Sandberg is in the crosshairs. The myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career . Her new book, \"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,\" is out Monday, and her arguments, focusing on how women in the workplace can grow their careers and their lives, have attracted both praise and denunciation -- though, as the New Yorker's Anna Holmes has noted, many of the denouncers have jumped on Sandberg in the \"ready, fire, aim\" fashion typical of the commentariat. \"Anyone who had read her book would have known that Sandberg herself is the first to acknowledge the debts she owes to the women who came before her, not to mention her youthful naivete and eventual engagement with gender politics,\" Holmes wrote. So just who is Sheryl Sandberg, and why are people saying such extreme things about her? A woman in Silicon Valley's boys' club . She's a rarity, for one. The Silicon Valley culture, as Ken Auletta observed in a thoughtful 2011 profile of Sandberg, remains male-dominated. As a woman, Sandberg has had to find her way among a boys' club not always friendly to her sex, though colleagues such as Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, once of Google herself, may be helping change that. At its core the tech industry is still a land of engineers -- coders and designers who put in endless caffeine-fueled hours trying to perfect the next cool thing, while the marketers and financial types are one step removed. Indeed, that was one reason Zuckerberg hired her: She \"handles things I don't want to,\" he told Auletta, so he can focus on his strengths. Sandberg, 43, was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in south Florida. Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother gave up teaching to raise Sheryl and two siblings. The family's passion was supporting Soviet Jews -- the \"refuseniks\" -- and their house became a meeting place for the movement. As a child, Sheryl sent letters to a Soviet \"twin,\" Kira Volvovsky, who developed a network of correspondents. \"I remember feeling when I was writing these girls, and they were writing me, that we had the same issues,\" Volvovsky told CNN last year. \"They wrote about the same stuff I was feeling.\" It's that kind of support group that Sandberg stresses in \"Lean In.\" How do you balance work and family? Share your story with CNN iReport . In a TED talk that echoes some of the material in the book, Sandberg mentioned that it's hard enough to succeed in a male-dominated world as a female businesswoman. In fact, there was one office, she observed, where she may have been the first woman to pitch a deal to a particular firm; the firm's partner didn't even know where the women's restroom was. Add to that the stresses of motherhood and it's no surprise she wants to offer encouragement to other working women, without sugar-coating the advice. Among the book's chapter titles are \"Sit at the Table,\" \"It's a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder\" and \"The Myth of Doing It All.\" University of Michigan business professor Marina Whitman, a pioneer in her own right -- she was a full-time professor and a corporate executive when it was unusual for women to lead companies -- agrees that \"doing it all\" is a mirage. \"I think this thing about 'can women have it all?' or 'can't they have it all?' is kind of a silly argument,\" she said. \"Yes, you may have it all, but not all at once.\" Moreover, she adds, success isn't to be measured by how many women become corporate CEOs, but by how much leeway women have to make their own choices. In her TED talk, Sandberg stresses the same point, emphasizing that choice doesn't often come without compromise, the kind that men aren't always asked to make. Women, she said, have \"to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table,\" she said. \"And we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not.\" 'I never thought I would write a book' Oh, that's easy for Sandberg to say, say her critics. Sure, she's worked hard, but she's had a gilded life. Indeed, Sandberg has regularly been at the head of her class. Summers, impressed by her work in his Harvard economics class, became her adviser and took her along when he joined the World Bank. She left that job two years later, in 1993, to join the prominent McKinsey & Co. consultancy. She earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, rejoined Summers as part of the Clinton administration, and was recruited by Google's Schmidt to join Google in 2001, when the company was just taking off -- a process she drove by improving the reach of AdWords and AdSense, two of Google's major moneymakers. Now, as COO of Facebook, she has been part of another phenomenon, a company that now claims more than a billion users. Sandberg holds close to 2 million Facebook shares and has options on millions more, according to the company's 2012 stock filing. She and her husband, SurveyMonkey CEO David Goldberg, share a brand-new 9,000-square-foot mansion. So of course she can leave work at 5:30 to take care of her two kids. After all, she's the boss. But for all her apparent wealth and power -- for all her success -- Sandberg appears to remain the rather retiring person she was in high school and college, the kind of person who \"did not speak or raise her hand,\" writes Auletta. \"I never thought I would write a book,\" she says in \"Lean In.\" She decided to do so only after years of discussion with colleagues. She defines \"leaning in\" as \"being ambitious,\" and it's an assertion she appears to make hesitantly because the stakes are so large. Now that \"Lean In\" is out, said MIT business professor Lotte Bailyn, Sandberg should use her bully pulpit to push workplace changes -- not just for women, but men as well. The typical workplace is the way it is because we accept our endless days and constant deadlines as the norm. We need less rigidity, more creativity, more room for work-life balance, she said. \"The problem isn't about fixing the women. The problem is about gender roles and dynamics and the expectations and norms that exist in the workplace,\" she said. \"As long as we keep emphasizing how to fix the women, I don't think we're going to get very far.\" Michigan's Whitman agreed that Sandberg can help change the dialogue. \"Absolutely Sheryl Sandberg is right to encourage women to have more self-confidence,\" she said. \"But I also think it's wrong to define success for women in terms of how many Sheryl Sandbergs we can produce. What is more critical is what can we change to make the balance less difficult for that much larger host of women who work not for self-fulfillment, but because they have to.\" For now, though, Sandberg has made her statement. As for all the criticism? Something she told Auletta two years ago suggests she's probably wondering why all the fuss is about her, and not the bigger issues. \"I feel really grateful to the people who encouraged me and helped me develop,\" she said. \"Nobody can succeed on their own.\" Opinion: Working moms, don't try to be perfect at home .\n\n**News 3**:\nHe is a 9-year-old boy without a country. Menachem Zivotofsky is a U.S. citizen, born in Jerusalem. There lies his dilemma. The State Department, in an unusual exception, will not allow his family to list \"Israel\" as the nation of birth on his U.S. passport. The Supreme Court will decide whether granting this \"small\" gesture on behalf of a child half a world away -- and others like him -- would disrupt the Obama administration's ongoing efforts to secure a binding, lasting peace settlement for the troubled region. Oral arguments in the case are set for Monday. At issue are two questions, one narrow, one broad: May courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport? And does the law impermissibly infringe on the president's power to recognize a foreign sovereign? \"There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have Israel indicated as their place of birth in the passports,\" said Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department. \"But this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the United States.\" The high court case is Zivotofsky v. Clinton, but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world, and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence: Jerusalem.  Its name translates as \"City of Peace\" to some, \"Holy Sanctuary\" to others. It is Israel's largest city and its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. Divided into East Jerusalem (populated mostly by Muslims) and West Jerusalem (populated mostly by Jews), the city spans over 48 square miles, with about 775,000 people. The terms \"East\" and \"West\" come layered with political, social, religious, and geographic questions -- amorphous, often misleading terms, symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents. Some use the terms \"Jewish\" or \"Arab\" Jerusalem to refer to the sections. The Old City is the heart of the region, a holy symbol to the three major Abrahamic religions -- Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. That tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the Temple Mount, Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Dome of the Rock, and al-Aqsa Mosque. It is believed to have been first settled in the fourth millennium BC, and according to the Bible, it was established as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel around 1000 BC by King David. It has been destroyed twice, and attacked, besieged and captured more than a hundred times. Canaanites, Hebrews, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Persians, crusaders, Turks, and the British have all laid claim to the land. Its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive Mideast peace agreement. During the 1948 war, the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of Israel, and the eastern part annexed by Jordan. The eastern part was then captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. It considers East Jerusalem part of its \"undivided capital,\" but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of Palestinian land. The Israeli government is based there, but no foreign embassies. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest sons were born in the United States, but the family migrated to Israel a decade ago, and in 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin was born. \"They're both proud American citizens but feel a very strong affinity, religiously too, to the state of Israel,\" said Alyza Lewin, the Zivotofsky's Washington-based lawyer. \"Their son is very proud of the fact that he is the one sibling born in Israel.\" Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says \"Place of Birth.\" President George W. Bush signed the bill, but issued an executive \"signing statement\" indicating he would not comply. The law, he said \"impermissibly interferes with the president's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch.\" It is not the first time the Congress and White House have clashed over the region. The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections. The boy's mother made the \"Israel\" request about two months after his birth, but embassy officials refused. His passport in fact shows his round, innocent face, and Jerusalem\" is listed as his place of birth. \"That's been the State Department's practice, the general rule for American citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth,\" said Alyza Lewin. \"So if a citizen is born for instance in Paris, it says France.  If they're born in Tel Aviv or Haifa, it says just Israel.  If you're born in Jerusalem, instead of saying the country, the city is listed-- just a city-- Jerusalem.\" The attorneys for the Zivotofskys have framed their case as a modest request, one that does not implicate the president's foreign policy power. They are asking the high court not to decide a political question, but simply tell the administration to enforce the law, for the sake of a little boy. \"It is a very personal case. What's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of Israel, and their right, given by Congress, to express that, on the passport,\" said Nathan Lewin, who will argue the family's case before the high court. \"That pride, and the national pride of others, is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is. But I don't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity. Congress has recognized that it's part of his self respect, that he should be able to say Israel, and that's all that we're asking for in this case.\" The government is thinking of the bigger picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record on a pending case, but President Obama has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the United States. \"Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state; Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met,\" he said in a May 2010 speech. \"I know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict. Two wrenching and emotional issues remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees. But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair, and that respects the rights and aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians.\" The justices in accepting the Zivotofsky appeal specifically added a legal question not raised by the family's lawyers: whether the congressional law steps on the president's foreign policy power. \"It's one of those issues that people probably find remarkable that it hasn't been addressed before,\" Cleveland said. \"Because, presidents have been recognizing states and governments for 200 years. Congress generally has acquiesced in what the president has done. There has been very little conflict over the exercise of that power traditionally, other than in, for example, the Taiwan [conflict with mainland China] and, in particular, over Jerusalem. This is an issue that has been a festering source of tension between Congress and presidents for decades.\" The family plans to attend the court session in Washington next week. Choosing a home, and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right. But nothing is so easy when Jerusalem is mentioned. The Zivotofskys say they recognize the geo-political complexity, but think in this case, in this judicial forum, the solution is simple. \"Everybody knows Jerusalem is in Israel. Why is the State Department refusing to recognize this?\" said Nathan Lewin. \"They have this is fear of nonexistent hobgoblins which has caused them to follow this policy, and it's about time -- Congress thought it was about time -- they get rid of that policy ... all that we're asking the Supreme Court to do is agree with Congress, that this is a foolish policy, and ought to be eliminated.\"\n\n**News 4**:\nAfter some of the world's biggest corporations such as Apple and Google have come under pressure over aggressive tax avoidance strategies, now its FIFA's turn to defend its lucrative financial arrangements with 2014 World Cup hosts Brazil. The relationship of football's world governing body with Brazil is under scrutiny following the protests that have gripped the country as the South American country stages June's Confederation Cup -- a test run for the main event next year. Initially disgruntlement of the protesters centered on a 20 centavos (10 cents) rise in bus and train fares. But a violent response from the police, prompted Brazilians of all ages took to the streets. Suddenly the issue was about corruption, poor public services, increasing inflation, lack of security and whether the money being spent on the World Cup might be better invested elsewhere. With a subtext of the rich lining their pockets, while the poor pay more to use crumbling public services, the Brazilian government was left scrambling to deal with what some have dubbed the \"Tropical Spring.\" FIFA president Sepp Blatter, for one, was askance at the protests. \"I can understand that people are not happy, but they should not use football to make their demands heard,\" Blatter told Brazil's Globo TV. Tax exemptions . While FIFA argues that Brazil, as well as Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022, will gain benefits from infrastructure development and tourism as well as the kudos of staging a global sporting event, the World Cup is key for the world governing body -- the event is its major source of revenue. \"The exact number I do not know but around $4 billion,\" said FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke earlier in June, referring to what the 2014 World Cup will generate financially for the Swiss-based organization. However, that is a conservative estimate with consultants suggesting the amount could reach $5 billion. \"Of course it's not all profit, it is commercial revenue related to the cycle of not just the World Cup, but the cycle between the 2010 Cup and 2014,\" added Valcke. Three years ago the World Cup in South Africa raised $3.6 billion, incurring expenditures of $1.298 billion. For its latest results, FIFA reported a profit of $89 million for 2012, with reserves of $1.378 billion. The organization had a revenue of $1.166 billion last year and spending of $1.077 billion. As a not-for-profit association in Swiss law, FIFA pays no tax on commercial income from the World Cup. But some critics question whether the relationship between FIFA and its World Cup hosts is mutually beneficial, notably with regard to the lucrative tax exemptions World Cup organizers are prepared to offer for the right to stage the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world. According to Brazil's Internal Revenue Service the tax exemptions will cost $248.7 million, though other reports estimate the figure could be as twice as high for the period between 2011 and 2015. The International Olympic Committee will receive similar exemptions when the South American country hosts the Olympics in 2016. Proponents argue hosting the World Cup brings billions more dollars into the Brazilian economy, but $250 million buys a lot of bus tickets. Brazil in \"FIFA's hands\" Ex-Brazilian star Romario -- now a Brazilian politician --  is one that argues that the money spent on building stadiums would be better spent on constructing houses and schools. \"FIFA will make a profit of four billion reais ($1.8 billion) which should provide one billion ($450 million) in tax, but they will not pay anything,\" Romario said in a video posted on the websites of several Brazilian newspapers. \"They come, set up the circus, they don't spend anything and they take everything with them. \"The real president of our country is FIFA,\" added Romario. \"FIFA comes to our country and sets up a state within a state.\" Another critic -- academic and journalist Christopher Gaffney, who lives in Rio -- believes that FIFA's much vaunted \"Fair Play\" slogan should not just apply to on-field behavior. \"FIFA should be obliged to follow the pre-existing tax laws in the host countries that apply to international sports non-governmental organizations and their corporate partners,\" said Gaffney. \"We saw a response in the lead up to London 2012 that the British were revolted that the International Olympic Committee's partners were not going to pay taxes. \"A boycott ensued and the companies agreed to pay taxes on their Olympic related profits. \"There are, of course, always government subsidies to attract businesses, but legislative elements like the General Law of the World Cup in Brazil go far beyond this and effectively redirect public money into Swiss bank accounts.\" That analysis drew a swift response from football's world governing body. \"FIFA obtains none of its revenue from public funds of the host country,\" a FIFA spokesman told CNN. \"The host country provide the general infrastructure for the event, which remains as a legacy in the country such as transportation, IT, upgrades on airports. \"Therefore, it is not true that money is generated in the host country for FIFA and that it will go then to accounts in Switzerland.\" But the exemptions FIFA insist upon, has surprised one leading European taxation expert, Professor of European Tax Law Han Kogels, who is based in Rotterdam. In bidding for the 2018 World Cup, Russia was up against three other bidders -- England, Netherlands-Belgium and Spain-Portugal. \"In that bid book model of the FIFA as commercial organization, it claimed a privilege of 100% tax freedom (no corporate tax, no income tax, no VAT, no excise duties, no local tax, not any other taxes), irrespective of regular national tax law, European tax law and international tax law,\" said Kogels after examining the Netherlands part of the bid. \"I was (and still am) not aware of any other international commercial sport event being subsidized through full tax exemption at the cost of (other) taxpayers, and did not see any justification for such unequal treatment of FIFA.\" Economic benefits . FIFA insisted that tax exemptions needed to be viewed in relation to the overall economic benefits that next year's World Cup potentially might bring Brazil. The world governing body quoted a study by Ernst & Young Terco that estimated that the event would inject R$ 112.8 billion ($50 billion) into the Brazilian economy by 2014, with R$ 28 billion (12.4 billion) spent on infrastructure, generating R$ 63.5 billion ($28 billion) in income for the population. \"It is important to note that tax exemptions are only related to certain areas of the organization, in particular for temporary use of goods and services during the event,\" FIFA told CNN. \"Examples include IT equipment for broadcasters as well as other material mainly broadcasters and participating teams bring with them, the cars used for the official transport, uniforms for volunteers. \"Amongst others the prize money of the FIFA World Cup is taxable in Brazil.\" \"Overall, according to the Ernst & Young Terco study it is estimated that the host country will obtain an additional tax revenue of R$ 18.1 billion ($8 billion). \"It should be noted that FIFA also bears the costs related to hosting and staging of the FIFA World Cup, including and not limited to the costs of the Local Organising Committee. This means over $1.3 billion in costs for FIFA.\" Cynicism . However, in much the same way that the Group of Eight economies attempted to bring coherence to the issue of closing global tax loopholes earlier this month, Professor Simon Chadwick called on governments and sporting organizations to adopt a more systematic approach to tax. \"One of the problems in Brazil, Britain and, indeed, in many countries across the world is that there is no coherent strategy or policy in place regarding taxation and sport,\" said Chadwick. \"For example, players in this year's Champions League final at Wembley were given exemption from paying tax on revenues earned from the game. \"Whereas in 2015, players in the rugby union World Cup final will not be given the same  exemption. Such a lack of strategy, clarity, consistency and openness creates a climate in which confusion, contradiction and cynicism begin to develop.\" Given the scale of the protests in Brazil, does the South American country want to renegotiate the tax exemptions? \"Holding a FIFA World Cup involves agreements that are signed between the organization and the host country in order to receive the event.,\" said the Brazil Finance Ministry. \"The FIFA World Cup has always been seen by Brazil as a major opportunity to spur investments in infrastructure and services and to modernize football management in Brazil.\""}

There was a \"child care mixup\" at home, an aide said. Weiner had to peel off the campaign trail and hustle back to his Park Avenue residence to pick up his 20-month-old son, Jordan. Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, has been absent from his side for weeks. But a small band of Weiner volunteers waited patiently for their candidate near the entrance to Pier 1 in Manhattan's Riverside Park, distributing campaign fliers to a largely disinterested crowd of families soaking in some late summer sun at the Westside County Fair. As they lingered, an otherwise normal-looking middle-aged man approached each of the volunteers and angrily thrust a finger in their faces. One by one, he scolded them with a nonsensical reprimand: \"Sexting for mayor!\" he yelled. \"Sexting for mayor!\" By the time Weiner arrived, the man was gone, and the former congressman avoided yet another public confrontation over the lewd online chats that torpedoed his once-promising mayoral bid. These scenes have become an almost daily routine for Weiner since he admitted in July that his naughty online behavior had continued well after he resigned from Congress in 2011, when he copped to exchanging racy pictures and lurid messages with women he had met on the Internet. Weiner today is more of a public curiosity than a serious candidate, despite being the best pure political talent in a Democratic field bereft of charisma and the kind of outsized personalities to which New York voters have become accustomed. After once leading the mayor's race, he is now in a distant fourth place. If no candidate captures more than 40% of the vote in Tuesday's primary -- and front-runner Bill de Blasio just might -- the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election. Combative Weiner still says he can win . Weiner will not be one of them, despite what he tells reporters. \"I'm convinced that I'm going be the next mayor of this city,\" Weiner said Sunday during an interview on NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" an appearance that seemed wildly discordant with his diminished stature in New York, where the press is mostly ignoring him (unless he clashes with a loud-mouthed voter). Weiner challenges man who rebuked him for being 'married to an Arab' Scant media coverage but plenty of attention . At appearance after appearance during his final weekend of campaigning, a frantic schedule that featured 13 public events and trio of \"tele-town halls,\" Weiner attracted scant media attention. There were just two members of the press at a Weiner event Saturday in which he presented his \"closing arguments\" for a fairer tax system to a group of Spanish-speaking voters from Washington Heights, with the assistance of a translator. The next day, outside a YMCA in the Upper West Side where Weiner was pitching his affordable housing plan, a local news producer who had been detailed to the candidate said he was often the sole journalist at his events. After Weiner concluded his news conference, he asked whether any of the three reporters present had any questions about the topics at hand: public housing, rent regulations, mix-used zoning. There were none, so he took a question about de Blasio. But wherever he showed up during his admirably hectic final push -- on street corners, at community fairs, even at a cricket field in the far reaches of Queens -- Weiner would invariably draw a crowd of onlookers, most of them polite and nearly all of them reaching for their smartphones to document the moment. He is the human manifestation of click bait. While Weiner chatted with a voter on the corner of 105th and Amsterdam about expansion plans for NYU and Columbia University, an open-topped New York tour bus pulled up to a nearby stoplight. A heavyset man on the top deck of the bus spotted the candidate on the sidewalk -- from a 40-yard distance, no less -- and started flailing his arms and screaming at the top of his lungs: \"Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!\" Weiner paused and waved back. \"Welcome to New York! Stay as long as you want! Spend lots of money!\" In the closing days of the race, Weiner seems to be living in a sweet spot between shamelessness and fortitude, soldiering on in the face of mockery and barely any hope of winning. If he cracks double digits on Tuesday, it will be a surprise. Voters can't quite seem to figure out why he didn't quit the race weeks ago. Craig Meisner, a Democrat from Riverdale who runs a nonprofit, came upon one of Weiner's \"closing argument\" events Saturday while walking through Isham Park in upper Manhattan. Like hundreds of New Yorkers before and after him, he looked on curiously, snapped a picture and promptly posted it to Twitter. \"It makes no sense to me at all,\" Meisner said of Weiner's campaign. \"I am assuming he's running so that for his next step, his next office, he can say he's cleansed himself. You go through the process, you get vilified to whatever degree, and then you can run again for something else.\" What could have been . Where some see desperation, others wonder what could have been. \"Anthony Weiner is the best political performer in this field and is progressive and tough enough in his policies and rhetoric that he'd be at or near the top of this race were it not for his scandals,\" said one veteran of New York City politics who, because of friends working in rival campaigns, did not want to be named saying something nice about the man who called himself Carlos Danger. Weiner's brazenness, energy and full-blown New Yorkitude offer a stark contrast to the cautious and consultant-driven personas of his Democratic opponents. At a Harlem forum hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton on Saturday, Weiner held forth on the topic of civil rights, referring to members of the African-American audience as \"my brothers and sisters.\" When Weiner mistakenly referred to Sharpton as \"Rev. Jackson,\" he had the crowd in stitches with his quick recovery: \"Thank you! Good night!\" Even the front-running de Blasio couldn't match Weiner's effortless wit and ability to read a crowd. The next morning, Weiner called into Hot 97, the venerable New York hip-hop radio station. Asked to name his favorite rappers, Weiner quickly won over the DJs. \"I'm a big fan of Luda; I like Nas,\" he answered. \"But I'm little more a of dance hall reggae guy than a hip-hop guy.\" Much laughter ensued. None of this is to say that Weiner, freed from the burden of expectations, is feeling loose and breezy as his campaign winds down. Arriving at staged press events where there might only be one reporter waiting for him, Weiner can wear a pained look on his face, his jaw clenched tightly as he prepares to go through the motions of his outlining his policy positions even though they have no hope of making the papers. \"Lucky ducky artichucky,\" he muttered to himself as he prepared to speak to a single NY1 camera at his YMCA event. One reporter described his demeanor lately as \"sheepish,\" which is how Weiner looked when he arrived an hour late to Riverside Park holding the hand of his son, Jordan, who was wearing the world's tiniest fedora. \"See the hat? He's bringing sexy back,\" Weiner said. As with everywhere he goes, observers hung back as Weiner walked along the Hudson River waterfront, looking on curiously and snapping pictures. Mothers and fathers pushing strollers looked annoyed as Weiner's entourage clogged the walkway. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" one woman exclaimed. The appearance was billed as a \"retail\" event, but Weiner shook few hands, instead tending to his child and walking along the Hudson River waterfront for the benefit of the cameras. The fact that Weiner is now being trailed at all times by filmmaker Josh Kriegman, a former producer for the MTV reality series \"MADE,\" only adds to the sense that his campaign, in its final days, is as much performance art as pursuit of office. Weiner is asked how he steels himself for this perplexing ritual every morning before he leaves his apartment. \"This is the only campaign I know how to run,\" he explains, pointing to the dozens of news ideas he has floated during the campaign. \"Every single I day I get up and I think, I am going to run the campaign New Yorkers want. This is where I am comfortable. This is what I like doing, and this has always worked for me. So I am not going to stop.\"\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN)Imagine spending your entire career searching for something buried somewhere within the Earth -- and then when you miraculously find it, the federal government seizes your discovery. That's the predicament paleontologist Peter Larson found himself in after he and his team unearthed a nearly complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton in 1990, preserved for some 67 million years in what is now the state of South Dakota. It is the most intact T-Rex skeleton ever found. Larson and his team had permission from the rancher, Maurice Williams, to dig on his property.  Before they had fully unearthed the fossil and realized its significance, they paid Williams $5,000 for the discovery. \"That was the most that any landowner had ever gotten (for a dinosaur fossil in the ground),\" Larson said. \"We shook hands and he (Williams) was pretty excited about seeing it set up in the museum.\" Larson and his team from the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota had planned to showcase their discovery at the institute. But that never happened and Larson would soon find himself in the middle of a protracted legal battle that would result in him serving time in federal prison. Flat tire leads to fossil find . Maybe if the 1975 Suburban hadn't gotten a flat tire. Maybe if Sue Hendrickson hadn't been so impatient -- or if she hadn't gotten lost in the fog, the Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton would still be in that craggy South Dakota rockface. On the morning of August 12, 1990, the Black Hills fossil hunter team's Suburban broke down so Hendrickson decided to venture out on her own on Maurice Williams' ranch where the team had spent weeks searching for fossils. That foggy morning, she walked right into the discovery of a lifetime. \"Anybody who had any idea what a fossil versus a rock (looked like) would have seen it,\" Hendrickson said. \"There (were) a lot of broken bones dribbling down (and) about 8 feet up the side of the cliff, there were three articulated vertebrae and a couple of other pieces of bone sticking out.\" Hendrickson immediately showed one of the vertebrae to her colleagues. Amazed, Larson said he and the team \"literally ran back to the site.\" They nicknamed the T-Rex \"Sue\" after Hendrickson, and spent the next few weeks carefully unearthing the fossilized skeleton after paying Williams for the find. The bones, still encased in plaster and earth, were transferred to the Black Hills Institute where they began the long, arduous process of separating and preparing them for display -- a dream of Larson and his brother, Neal, also a member of his team. \"Ever since we created that little museum on our parents' ranch, it's always been our dream to have a museum here in Hill City (South Dakota),\" Peter Larson said, referring to the Black Hills Institute.  \"And finding Sue, the Tyrannosaurus Rex -- here's the anchor for the museum.\" More than 80% of the skeleton was recovered -- making \"Sue\" the most complete and largest T-Rex ever discovered.  And the scientific impact was huge: One of the most interesting discoveries, according to Larson, was that the injuries to the bones indicated that Sue had died after being attacked by another T-Rex. Larson said he and the entire town hoped that a public display of Sue would \"put Hill City on the map.\" Their excitement soon turned to outrage as federal agents arrived on the doorstep of the Black Hills Institute. Whose fossil is it? The morning of May 12, 1992, the Black Hills Institute paleontology team was still riding high. They had just succeeded in separating the T-Rex's pelvis from its skull -- a process that took more than a year and, if done incorrectly, could have damaged the prized skull. \"Taking that hip off of Sue's skull was critical. ...  You don't have a second chance,\" said paleontologist Terry Wentz.  \"One little movement (and) it could be cracking it all the way through inside.\" Around 7 that morning,  FBI agents and the National Guard arrived at the institute and seized Sue, the records related to the T-Rex and other documents from the Black Hills Institute. \"I go down to the office and there's two FBI agents sitting there (saying) 'You've stolen this from federal land and we're coming here to seize this,' \" Peter Larson said. It took days for the federal agents to load up the fossil and during that time, Hill City residents showed up to protest which attracted the attention of the national media. The \"entire town of Hill City ... was in mourning when they took that dinosaur away,\" said Black Hills Institute's office manager Marion Zenker. Even though the team had gotten permission and paid the landowner for the fossil find, Maurice Williams -- who died in 2011 -- had apparently changed his claim and said the fossil belonged to him, said Kristin Donnan, author of \"Rex Appeal\" and Peter Larson's ex-wife. In addition, it turned out Williams' private ranch was part of Indian Trust land, which further complicated who owned Sue. On top of that, five years before Sue's discovery, the National Park Service (NPS) had begun to investigate the Black Hills Institute for illegally collecting fossils on public lands, said NPS senior geologist Vincent Santucci. \"There was a civil matter that dealt with the ownership of Sue ... (and) there was a separate, criminal investigation that had very little to do with Sue,\" Santucci told CNN. \"I think ... the dinosaur overshadowed a lot of that discussion and ... created confusion.\" Navigating the tricky land laws were central to the federal case against the Black Hills Institute.  For 18 months, Sue remained locked up as the federal government gathered enough evidence to charge Larson and the other members of the institute -- giving immunity deals to several employees and friends of the institute in exchange for their testimony. Sue Hendrickson was one of those given immunity -- but she said she had nothing incriminating to say because \"they didn't do anything wrong.\" The IRS and the National Park Service conducted the bulk of the federal investigation against Larson and the Black Hills Institute.  Keith Nelson, the lead investigator for the IRS, said the evidence recovered at the institute was overwhelming. \"There were so many bones, so many animals, so many invertebrates that were taken off of public lands, taken internationally, sold internationally. ... There was way more than we ever could have investigated,\" Nelson said. He stressed that Sue \"wasn't ... what was being looked at as far as potential criminal violations.\" Larson and his colleagues have denied taking fossils off of public lands. In November 1993, a federal grand jury returned a 39-count indictment containing 153 charges against Peter Larson and five others linked to the Black Hills Institute, including Wentz and Larson's brother, Neal.  The 153 charges in the indictment included fossil theft, money laundering, and false statements to government agencies. None of the charges were directly related to Sue. In fact, during the trial, the court instructed both sides and all witnesses to avoid discussing the T-Rex. In the end, Williams made $7.6 million from the eventual auction of Sue, who was put on display at Chicago's Field Museum -- and Peter Larson served 18 months in federal prison for customs violations unrelated to the T-Rex. After Sue . Today, Peter Larson still runs the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, where his enthusiasm for T-Rexes hasn't abated.  He and his team have found a total of 10 partial Tyrannosaurus Rex skeletons. Despite everything that happened to him and his team, Larson says he's glad that Sue is on public display. He even went to the dinosaur's 2000 unveiling in Chicago as a guest of Sue Hendrickson's. He hasn't given up on his dream of returning Sue \"in some form\" to Hill City: He's asking the Field Museum for a full research cast of the T-Rex . \"I think it's probably the second best place she could have been,\" he said, referring to Chicago. \"People can see her and get the same excitement that I have for her.\" For more on this story, watch CNN Films' \"Dinosaur 13\" Thursday, December 11 at 9 p.m. ET on CNN . CNN's Meridith Edwards and Kyung Lah contributed to this report .\n\n**News 3**:\nA Senate report delivered a scathing indictment Tuesday of torture policies that officially ended when President Barack Obama came into office, but another holdover from the Bush-era war on terrorism is keeping Obama tethered to the previous administration. Nearly six years after Obama signed an executive order on his third day in office to begin the process of shutting down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, 136 prisoners remain in military custody on the U.S. naval base, despite the release of six more prisoners just this week. About 100 have been released since 2009. Obama may have ended the CIA's torture program, but his administration has yet to come close to shutting down Guantanamo, which has become an international symbol of U.S. abuses in the post-9/11 war on terror. And the torture report's release prompted a nearly 13-year detainee of the notorious prison to recount the severe mistreatment he endured, writing in a CNN Opinion column that the report is \"just the start of what Americans have to accept happened in their name.\" Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel, a Yemeni man accused of serving in Osama bin Laden's security detail, described conditions at Guantanamo that included the repeated, seemingly incessant interrogations he faced at the hands of U.S. officials. Also on this story: My treatment shames American flag . The abuses alleged by the prisoner are similar to those outlined in the Senate report, which focused on the interrogations of detainees held in secret overseas facilities in the years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Naji listed sleep deprivation, humiliation and beatings -- abuses similar to those described as \"tantamount to torture\" in a 2004 International Committee of the Red Cross report leaked to The New York Times. Naji also described the painful force-feeding he has been subjected to as he and as many as 100 other prisoners have engaged in hunger strikes to protest their continued detention without charge. CNN could not independently verify the claims made in Naji's editorial piece. When contacted by CNN, the National Security Council said it would not comment on individual claims such as Naji's. The abuses asserted by Naji were also suffered by other detainees at Guantanamo, said Tom Wilner, an attorney who has represented Guantanamo detainees in two cases that went before the U.S. Supreme Court. \"Cold cells, uncomfortable positions, beating them up, making them pee in their pants, the sexual taunting -- it was all within the range of what was done to many of them,\" said Wilner, who represented 12 Kuwaitis detained in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2004. Guantanamo Fast Facts . His clients also spoke of the pornography room that Naji mentions in his column, Wilner said. Naji said he was forced to view pornographic images of women and men, as his interrogators stripped him of his clothes. \"I've heard worse. I've heard that they had women come in and touch them, which for Muslim men is a terrible thing,\" said Wilner, who has visited Gitmo 14 times. An international human rights legal group representing Naji and several other Guantanamo detainees contends that the abuses were common. \"Almost every one of my clients has reported identical treatment to what Samir details in this piece,\" said Alka Pradhan, counterterrorism counsel for Reprieve US, an international human rights nongovernmental organization headquartered in London. Reprieve represents a total of 10 Guantanamo detainees, including nationals from Yemen, Pakistan, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, Pradhan said. Pradhan, however, wasn't involved in the preparation of Naji's op-ed, which is written in Naji's words, she said. Some of the abuses continue, Pradhan charged. \"They are still in freezing cells, they still have problems with food, and they are still being treated roughly or hit by the guards,\" she said. \"Recently, this past summer, (the detainees) had incredibly invasive genital searches\" whenever they left their cells to receive a phone call or meet with their attorneys, said Pradhan, who has visited Gitmo three times. \"Some of them felt they were being penetrated,\" she said of the searches. \"It's just that the torture continues in different forms, but as long as the government applies this secrecy to Guantanamo Bay, we won't find out until years after the fact.\" Guantanamo Bay: What happens when detainees held for years get out? Guantanamo detainees -- of which there have been nearly 800 -- were allegedly tortured at the site, drawing widespread international condemnation from human rights and civil liberties advocates who decried the interrogation techniques and the U.S. authority to detain the suspected terrorists without charges. Nearly all Guantanamo prisoners are being held without charges, and while about half of those are considered high-level threat detainees, the remainder were determined to be low-level threats by a task force of top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Those in the latter group could gain their freedom, provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries. Security concerns have set back and stalled the shuttering of the notorious facility, and the release of Guantanamo prisoners has drummed up serious opposition in Congress on both sides of the aisle. In December 2010, Congress amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any Guantanamo detainees to the United States. That defeated the Obama administration's plans announced a year earlier to try several Guantanamo detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in U.S. federal court. Among those, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a mastermind of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, was slated to be flown to New York to face trial in federal court. ISIS Fast Facts . The 2010 legislation also banned Obama from using federal funds to build a detention facility to house the Guantanamo detainees on U.S. soil under existing authority. U.S. officials have defended the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists without trial or charges as legitimate under laws of war, saying that Congress' 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force against al Qaeda allows the United States to detain those enemy combatants until the fight against al Qaeda -- and associated groups like ISIS -- ends. It is of course unclear when that fight could or would reach an official conclusion. But members of Congress continue to oppose the release of Guantanamo detainees -- even those considered low-level threats -- because of the risk that they could engage in terrorism against the United States. About 17% of the total of 620 detainees released from Guantanamo -- most during President George W. Bush's presidency -- have since engaged in terrorist activities, according to the September 2014 semiannual report from the director of national intelligence. Another 12% are suspected of engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. Even if all the detainees recommended for release by the interagency task force are transferred out of Guantanamo, about 69 detainees would remain, according to The New York Times. \"So we're stuck with Guantanamo,\" Pradhan said. \"Now, we're in a hole. \"I tend to be a pessimist about it. No matter what the President continues to say, I don't think this is his priority anymore,\" she added. Those detainees include Mohammed and a handful of others slated for trial under the military commission system, as well as dozens who are considered serious high-level threats but could not be tried and convicted -- and that legal limbo is the ultimate conundrum Obama faces as he looks to make good on a long-overdue campaign promise to close the facility before his term ends. And while just four Guantanamo detainees were released under Leon Panetta's 2011-2013 tenure as defense secretary, Obama renewed his commitment to closing the prison in 2013. Since then, 30 prisoners have been transferred to other countries under Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's tenure, The New York Times reported. Those included five mid- to high-level Taliban militants who were released from Guantanamo this spring in exchange for the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was being held by Taliban forces in Afghanistan. And the specter of ISIS has stoked more fears in Washington that former detainees could attack the United States or Americans abroad if freed. Case in point: The U.S. military released Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was captured in 2004 and held at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in Iraq. He was released later that year. He went on to become the leader of ISIS and is the self-declared caliph of the so-called Islamic State.\n\n**News 4**:\nFor the first time, someone in the Obama administration apologized for the problem-plagued Obamacare website. Marilyn Tavenner also said on Tuesday that the online troubles were being resolved and the overall program was working, albeit slower and less successfully than hoped. In the first congressional testimony from a government official on the botched launch of HealthCare.gov, the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the House Ways and Means Committee that the \"vast majority\" of consumers would be able to successfully use the site by the end of November. \"I want to apologize to you that the website does not work as well as it should,\" she said, adding that HealthCare.gov \"can and will be fixed.\" The hearing served as a hot seat for Tavenner, whose agency has been blamed for the website troubles causing a political headache for President Barack Obama and his signature health care reforms, as well as a venting session for Republicans after their failed efforts to scuttle the reforms. Tavenner reports to Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has come under fire for the problems that plagued the introduction of the enrollment website. Some congressional Republicans demand her resignation or firing, and Sebelius will face a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. She is expected to tell that committee the initial experience of HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many, and unacceptable. But she will also defend Obamacare, according to prepared remarks. \"The fact is that the Affordable Care Act delivered on its product: quality, affordable health insurance. The tremendous interest shown in HealthCare.gov shows that people want to buy this product. We know the initial consumer experience at HealthCare.gov has not been adequate. We will address these initial and any ongoing problems, and build a website that fully delivers on this promise of the Affordable Care Act,\" Sebelius is expected to say. The health secretary will provide figures for the site, which has had more than 20 million unique visits to date. Over the past few weeks, nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted. People are also signing up through a call center, paper applications and in-person assistance. \"By enlisting additional technical help, aggressively monitoring errors, testing to prevent new issues from cropping up, and regularly deploying fixes to the site, we are working to ensure consumers' interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one, and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise,\" Sebelius will say. In an exclusive interview last week, the health secretary told CNN that Obama didn't know of the problems with the Affordable Care Act's website until after its troubled launch on October 1. This was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a prelaunch test run. Policies canceled . More trouble for Obama came out of the testimony, as Tavenner conceded that some people with individual health coverage -- rather than the group coverage that most Americans have -- will be forced to get new policies because of increased requirements under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. \"These individuals in a small group, our individual markets, had no protections\" before the reforms became law, Tavenner explained. Until now, such consumers \"could be kicked out any time for pre-existing conditions\" or realize too late that their policies failed to cover hospitalization or cancer treatments, Tavenner said. The reforms protect them by requiring a minimum standard of coverage, she added. For some, that means more expensive policies and any change breaks the oft-repeated pledge by Obama that \"if you like your plan, you can keep your plan\" when he was pushing for Congress to pass his signature reforms. Republican Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois hammered Tavenner on that point, noting a constituent who got a letter telling her that the health care reforms caused the cancellation of her current plan with a more expensive alternative in its place. \"She has health insurance that she likes. She's been paying her premium. She wants to keep it. But she can't,\" Schock said. \"Isn't that a lie?\" Tavenner responded that some insurers changed or discontinued plans that failed to meet the Obamacare requirements, even though present coverage could still be offered in some cases under a \"grandfather\" provision in the legislation, despite lacking the full benefits of the reforms. She advised anyone being forced to get a new policy to examine all options under the new system, including the possibility of getting federal subsidies if they are eligible. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans -- at least two-thirds of the population in 2011 -- had coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said \"a significant portion\" of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges. \"One of the issues that the Affordable Care Act was designed to address was the need to provide greater security to those Americans forced to seek insurance on the individual market,\" Carney said. On Capitol Hill, a top House Democrat told reporters on Tuesday that his party \"should have been more precise\" when making the pledge about people keeping coverage they liked. \"I think preciseness would have been better,\" said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland. He added that the promise was made to try to allay the fears of the majority of Americans who get health coverage from their employers or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Partisan exchanges . As expected, Tuesday's hearing included fiery partisan exchanges, with Republicans saying the website problems foreshadow deeper problems that threaten higher premiums and government intrusion in future health coverage while Democrats accused them of trying to kill reforms that benefit millions of Americans. Under GOP questioning, Tavenner said initial figures on how many people have enrolled so far for health coverage under the reforms won't be available until mid-November. She noted that the administration has expected the initial enrollment to be small, but noted that the enrollment period ends on March 31. When asked by Republicans about the expected initial low enrollment, Tavenner pointed out that a similar dynamic occurred with implementation of the Massachusetts health care law, when people waited until the final deadline approached to sign up. To GOP Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the committee chairman, low enrollment signals the failure of the health care reforms, which need young people,  and people who are less expensive to insure, to sign up so insurers can offer affordable plans in markets that include older and people who are more expensive to cover. \"I fear we can see a fundamental breakdown of the insurance market where premiums will skyrocket, pricing millions of Americans out of health care,\" he said. Later, Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas asked Tavenner for a guarantee that consumers will be able to obtain coverage required by the health care law before the deadline. \"What I can guarantee is that we have a system that is working.  We are going to improve the speed of that system,\" she said. But Brady interrupted her. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"You are saying the system right now is working?\" Tavenner didn't budge, responding: \"I am saying it is working.  It is just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want.\" Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey lambasted Republicans on the panel for choosing to pile on the website woes in their continuing attempt to dismantle Obamacare instead of working with Democrats to improve settled law. Citing the political battle last decade over the Bush administration's Medicare prescription drug benefit opposed by Democrats, Pascrell noted \"we lost the policy fight\" then but chose to help make the program work instead of trying to discredit or undermine it. Standing up and pointing at his GOP colleagues, Pascrell shouted: \"How many of you stood up to do that?  None.  Zero.  Zero.\" Website problems . Late Tuesday, officials said the data hub behind the Obamacare website was experiencing an outage, prohibiting customers from submitting new applications. Verizon, which provides some technology services behind HealthCare.gov, said federal officials asked the company to provide additional computing and storage ability. \"At the request of HHS's deputy CIO, we are now undertaking infrastructure maintenance, which should be complete overnight,\" Verizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said. \"We anticipate the strengthened infrastructure will help eliminate application downtimes.\" A key tech malfunction brought down the site Sunday. In prepared testimony for the hearing, Tavenner said private contractors hired to create the website \"have not met expectations.\" Asked about that statement, she cited one of the contractors -- CGI Federal, which has a contract worth as much as $200 million for its work on the system."}

Hagan was freed a day earlier than planned because his paperwork was processed more quickly than anticipated, according to the New York State Department of Correctional Services. Hagan, 69, walked out of the minimum-security Lincoln Correctional Facility at 11 a.m. The facility is located at the intersection of West 110th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. Hagan had been in a full-time work-release program since March 1992 that allowed him to live at home with his family in Brooklyn five days a week while reporting to the prison just two days. Last month, Hagan pleaded his case for freedom: To return to his family, to become a substance abuse counselor and to make his mark on what time he has left in this world. He was dressed in prison greens as he addressed the parole board. He had been before that body 14 other times since 1984. Each time, he was rejected. Hagan was no ordinary prisoner. He is the only man to have confessed in the killing of Malcolm X, who was gunned down while giving a speech in New York's Audubon Ballroom in 1965. \"I have deep regrets about my participation in that,\" he told the parole board on March 3, according to a transcript. \"I don't think it should ever have happened.\" Hagan had been sentenced to 20 years to life imprisonment after being found guilty at trial with two others in 1966. The other two men were released in the 1980s and have long denied involvement in the killing. To win his release, Hagan was required to seek, obtain and maintain a job, support his children and abide by a curfew. He must continue to meet those conditions while free. He told the parole board he's worked the same job for the past seven years. He told the New York Post in 2008 he was working at a fast-food restaurant. A parole officer checked on him while outside prison, and he had to undergo random drug tests. CNN was unable to reach Hagan for a comment about his release. The Nation of Islam declined comment for this story. Malcolm X is best known as the fiery leader of the Nation of Islam who denounced whites as \"blue-eyed devils.\" But at the end of his life, Malcolm X changed his views toward whites and discarded the Nation of Islam's ideology in favor of orthodox Islam. In doing so, he feared for his own life from within the Nation. Malcolm X remains a symbol of inspiration for black men, in particular, who are moved by his transformation from a street hustler to a man the late African-American actor Ossie Davis eulogized as \"our own black shining prince.\" The ballroom where he was killed has now been converted into The Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. Board Chairman Zead Ramadan said the center doesn't have a position on Hagan's release. \"I personally find it strange that for a couple decades any person convicted in the assassination of such an iconic figure would be allowed such leniency,\" Ramadan said. There's outrage among some African-Americans, he said, that he's being released. Would he be set free if he had killed an iconic white leader? \"It's really a struggle for Muslims to contemplate this issue, because our faith and our religion is full of examples where we have to exert mercy,\" he added. \"The Malcolm X story has not ended. His populuarity has grown in death. ... Only God knows why this was allowed to happen.\" The center is preparing for a special service next month to celebrate what would have been Malcolm X's 85th birthday. Would the center welcome Hagan if he asked to attend? \"We'd cross that bridge if he called us,\" Ramadan said, \"Think about that: How far-fetched is it that he could meet one of the daughters of Malcolm X? And what's going to happen then? Mercy, fury, anger, emotions -- who knows?\" Killed in front of his family . On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X took to the stage of the Audubon Ballroom, a site often used for civic meetings. His wife, Betty Shabazz, and four children were in the crowd. \"I heard several shots in succession,\" his wife later told a Manhattan grand jury. \"I got on the floor, and I pushed my children under the seat and protected them with my body.\" Gunshots continued to ring out, she said. Her husband's body was riddled with bullets. The native of Omaha, Nebraska, was 39. \"Minister Malcolm was slaughtered like a dog in front of his family,\" A. Peter Bailey, one of Malcolm X's closest aides, told The New York Times on the 40th anniversary of the killing. The assassination came after a public feud between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam's founder, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X had accused Muhammad of infidelity and left the Nation in March 1964. \"For the next 11 months, there was a pattern of harassment, vilification and even on occasion literally pursuit in the streets of Malcolm by people associated with the Nation,\" said Claude Andrew Clegg III, author of a biography on Elijah Muhammad called An Original Man. \"Malcolm felt that if Elijah Muhammad snapped his fingers, then he could stop the escalation of the violent tone around the split of the two men. And I think there's some truth to that.\" Over the years, the killing of Malcolm X has been the subject of much debate, with conspiracy theories involving the Nation of Islam and others. The Nation of Islam has repeatedly denied any involvement in Malcolm X's assassination. On a deadly mission . Hagan, then known by the name Talmadge X Hayer, was in his early 20s and a radical member of the Nation of Islam the day he entered the ballroom armed and ready to kill. His allegiance was to the Nation's founder, and he was outraged Malcolm X had broken from its ranks. After the shooting, Hagan tried to flee the scene but he was shot in the leg. He was beaten by the crowd before being arrested outside. Last month, he told the parole board he felt the urge to kill Malcolm X because of his inflammatory comments about the Nation's founder. \"It stemmed from a break off and confusion in the leadership,\" Hagan said. \"Malcolm X broke with the Nation of Islam, separated from the Nation of Islam, and in doing so there was controversy as to some of the statements he was making about the leader.\" He added, \"History has revealed a lot of what Malcolm X was saying was true.\" Two other men, Muhammad Abdul Aziz and Kahlil Islam, were also found guilty of murder in 1966 and received 20 years to life. Both proclaimed their innocence. Hagan, who eventually admitted his part in the murder, testified at trial and subsequent parole hearings that both men were innocent. Aziz was paroled in 1985; Islam was freed in 1987. At last month's parole hearing, Hagan again maintained that Aziz and Islam were not the other assassins. He said it was two other men who helped plot, plan and participate in the killing. Did they receive orders from the Nation to carry out the killing? \"I can't say that anyone in the Nation of Islam gave us the idea or instructed us to do it. We did this ourselves for the most part, yes,\" Hagan told the parole board. Hagan said he received a master's degree in sociology while incarcerated and that helped him deal with his actions from 45 years ago. \"I understand a lot better the dynamics of movements and what can happen inside movements and conflicts that can come up, but I have deep regrets about my participation in that.\" He added, \"Unfortunately, I didn't have an in-depth understanding of what was really going on myself to let myself be involved in anything like that. ... I can't really describe my remiss and my remorse for my actions -- basically a very young man, a very uneducated man. \" He is still a Muslim but no longer a member of the Nation of Islam. He volunteers at a mosque to help young men. He told the parole board he hopes to become a qualified substance abuse counselor. His primary mission is to help his four children, ages 21, 17, 14 and 10. He has two other grown children. \"My focus is to maintain my family and to try to make things a little better for them. It's upward mobility, and to encourage my children to complete their education because it's a must.\"\n\n**News 2**:\n(CNN)  -- I was 5 years old and my dad and I were on our way to the neighborhood bakery to buy a loaf of bread. It was early on the morning of January 1, 1959. A stranger stopped us on the deserted street right outside our second-floor apartment. CNN's Arthur Brice remembers his fear, uncertainty and excitement as a boy during the Cuban revolution. \"Did you hear?\" he asked. \"Batista is gone.\" Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista had fled the country in the middle of the night. Fidel Castro would soon be in power. Not many people can remember details from when they were 5 years old. But not many people have lived through what I did in the late 1950s. Conversations with my parents have refreshed those memories. I remember a sense of surprise and excitement that morning, tinged with fear and uncertainty. My dad says I was tranquil and quiet. \"Let's go back upstairs,\" he said after hearing the news. \"Yes, let's go, Papi,\" my dad quoted me as saying. Back in our apartment, we tuned the radio to a local station, which confirmed the news. My mother insisted we stay inside, saying there would be trouble. Indeed, a short while later, we heard loud gunshots as rebels hunted down Batista officials and supporters door-to-door. That night, someone went up to our building's rooftop patio, looking for a Batista supporter. Two shots rang out. I cringed, squatting next to a wall. I remember the terror I felt. That was the day the revolution triumphed. In two short years, Fidel Castro and his ragtag band of rebels had done what many considered impossible. They would soon march triumphantly down the spine of Cuba from their rebel stronghold in Oriente Province on the eastern end of the island to Havana to assume power. Fifty years later, Castro, his younger brother Raul and other revolutionaries are still there -- but not so for the millions of Cubans who have fled to the United States and elsewhere. Twenty-one months after that morning when we heard the news, my family and I would be among those refugees. It is fair to say that few Cubans who lived through the revolution expected that outcome. Castro had been hugely popular and widely seen as a savior who would deliver Cuba from 50 years of dictatorships and unstable governments. He had promised free elections and a return to constitutional government. The highly unpopular and much-feared Batista had been a major player in Cuban politics since 1933, when he and a group of low-ranking army officials took control of the government. A power-broker, Batista effectively ruled behind the scenes until he was elected president in 1940. He held power until 1944, when he was defeated for re-election. Batista did not go away quietly. He was elected to the Senate in 1948 and was running for president in 1952 when he staged a coup after it looked like he wouldn't win. Ruthless and dictatorial, he ruled with a bloody iron fist. Fidel Castro, meanwhile, had been a student leader at the University of Havana in the late 1940s, heavily involved in the violent and passionate Cuban politics. On July 26, 1953, he and a group of about 100 followers attacked the military Moncada Barracks in the eastern city of Santiago. The attack failed miserably and about half of the insurgents were killed. Castro fled to the nearby Sierra Maestra mountains, but was captured a short while later. While on trial in late 1953, he gave his famous \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech in which he said, \"Condemn me. It does not matter. History will absolve me.\" Pardoned under a general amnesty in 1955, Castro fled to Mexico, where he continued to plot against Batista. He formed the 26th of July Movement, named for the date of the Moncada Barracks attack, and gathered money and support. It was there that Castro met a man who would become a revolutionary legend, the Argentinean Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. In late November 1956, the rebels set sail from Veracruz aboard an old yacht named \"Granma.\" Castro and his group of less than 100 followers landed a week later in eastern Cuba, where most of them were caught or killed. Castro, his brother Raul and Guevara were among the handful who escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains, where Castro had sought refuge after his disastrous Moncada attack three years earlier. The rebel leader won popular support among the peasants in his remote hideaway while urban dissidents sowed insurrection in the cities. Adopting guerrilla warfare tactics, Castro and his followers were able to inflict stinging defeats on Batista's army, which was mostly composed of young, untrained and unmotivated soldiers. My mother, father, new baby brother and I lived in Santiago during the revolution, near the Sierra Maestra. From a vantage point in the city, we could see Batista's planes bombing the rebel strongholds in the distance. We would see Batista's armed troop convoys leaving their garrisons in the morning, heading for the jungle of the mountains. There were whispered comments among Cubans that  the ambulances full of dead and wounded soldiers were returning under cover of darkness in the middle of the night. What happened during the revolution registered strongly on a young boy who was robbed of a normal childhood, but who grew up witnessing history outside his front door. I remember my dad coming home from work one day with a bullet hole in his car from a stray shot. I remember heading to the beach one day along a country road outside Santiago and my dad unsuccessfully trying to push my head down in the back seat so I couldn't see the body lying next to the highway, barbed wire strung around the man's neck. I remember looking out the second-floor balcony of an apartment we previously lived in and seeing a car full of young men chasing a screaming woman down the middle of the street. The men's arms stretched out of the windows as they pointed weapons at the woman. The woman and the men disappeared from view, blocked by the corner of the building, so I never knew what happened to her. That day, a major shoot-out broke out in the plaza in front of our apartment and my mother and I hugged the floor for safety. She crawled into the kitchen and got me a small glass of wine, which she had me drink so I would fall asleep. When I woke, there was quiet -- but no peace. Another day, a car with four Batista secret police pulled up downstairs and the men got out, leaving the doors open and the engine running. They went into the business downstairs, searching for a Castro supporter. I don't know what happened there, either. I remember a few days after the announcement of Batista's defeat, Castro started his procession down from the mountains and along Cuba's central highway to the capital, Havana. My parents were thinking about going down to watch the triumphant parade, but I asked that we not. I was scared of what might happen. A few days later, I remember watching our console black-and-white TV as Castro gave his first speech before tens of thousands in Havana. I don't remember his words, but I do remember a white dove that perched on his shoulder as Camilo Cienfuegos, a major revolutionary leader and cohort, stood by his side. Every once in a while, Castro would stop and turn to Cienfuegos and ask him, \"Voy bien, Camilo?\" Am I doing OK, Camilo? And Cienfuegos would answer, \"Vas bien, Fidel.\" Ten months later, Cienfuegos' plane disappeared over the ocean during a flight to Havana, and the whispering started. Although it is widely held that Cienfuegos perished in an accident, many Cubans started saying privately that Castro or his brother Raul had him taken out over political differences or because of a perceived threat from the charismatic revolutionary known for wearing a wide-brimmed hat. To this day, the Castros continue to pay homage to Cienfuegos. An official logo for the 50th anniversary of the revolution bears a drawing of Castro and Cienfuegos. And to this day, I remember the day 50 years ago that began with a journey for a loaf of bread that would change my life and that of so many others forever.\n\n**News 3**:\nThe moment 18-year-old Army Pvt. Tim Josephs arrived at Edgewood Arsenal in 1968, he knew there was something different about the place. \"It just did not look like a military base, more like a hospital,\" recalled Josephs, a Pittsburgh native. Josephs had volunteered for a two-month assignment at Edgewood, in Maryland, lured by three-day weekends closer to home. \"It was like a plum assignment,\" Josephs said. \"The idea was they would test new Army field jackets, clothing, weapons and things of that nature, but no mention of drugs or chemicals.\" But when he went to fill out paperwork the morning after his arrival, the base personnel were wearing white lab coats, and Josephs said he had second thoughts. An officer took him aside. \"He said, 'You volunteered for this. You're going to do it. If you don't, you're going to jail. You're going to Vietnam either way -- before or after,'\" Josephs said recently. From 1955 to 1975, military researchers at Edgewood were using not only animals but human subjects to test a witches' brew of drugs and chemicals. They ranged from potentially lethal nerve gases like VX and sarin to incapacitating agents like BZ. Read the secret (now unclassified) Army document revealing BZ tests on soldiers (PDF) The military also tested tear gas, barbiturates, tranquilizers, narcotics and hallucinogens like LSD. Read the confidential (now unclassified) Army document uncovering LSD tests on volunteers (PDF) This top secret Cold War research program initially looked for ways to defend against a chemical or biological attack by the Soviet Union, thought to be far ahead of the United States in \"psycho-chemical\" warfare. But the research expanded into offensive chemical weapons, including one that could, according to one Army film obtained by CNN, deliver a \"veritable chemical ambush\" against an enemy. \"This incapacitating agent would be dispersed by standard munitions, and the agent would enter the building through all nonprotected openings,\" the film's narrator boasts. President Nixon ended research into offensive chemical weapons in 1969, and the military no longer uses human subjects in research on chemical agents, said a spokesman for Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, as the facility is known now. Tests began for Josephs almost as soon as he arrived at Edgewood for a two-month assignment on January 1, 1968. \"Sometimes it was an injection. Other times it was a pill,\" Josephs told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Josephs said he didn't know what drugs he was getting. \"A lot of chemicals were referred to as agent one or agent two.\" Some weeks, he would undergo one test; other weeks, more, Josephs said. And when he questioned the staff about whether he was in any danger, they reassured him: \"There is nothing here that could ever harm you.\" But Josephs, 63, believes the chemical agents he received during his two-month stint at Edgewood did harm him, triggering health problems that continue to plague him four decades later. Even when he talks about Edgewood, he said, \"I get a tightness in my chest.\" Parkinson's symptoms . Days before his Edgewood duty ended, in February 1968, Josephs was hospitalized for days with Parkinson's-like tremors, symptoms he said have followed him on and off throughout his adult life. From Edgewood, Josephs said he went to an Army installation in Georgia, where he experienced tremors so severe, he had to be admitted to the base hospital and given muscle relaxers. The Army then sent Josephs to Air Force bases in Thailand, in support of the war effort in Vietnam. He was told never to talk about his experiences at Edgewood and to forget about everything he ever did, said or heard at the Maryland base. Josephs left the service when his three-year tour ended, and he began a career as a real estate agent. He married Michelle, a nurse, in 1977, but the couple decided not to have children, fearing his chemical exposure might somehow affect them. In his mid-50s, Josephs was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological condition that forced him to retire early. Medications cost $2,000 a month, which he was paying for out of pocket. Josephs applied for veterans benefits based on chemical exposure at Edgewood. Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs granted him partial benefits for his Parkinson's for Agent Orange exposure during his time in Thailand, giving Josephs 40% disability. The letter granting him benefits made no mention of Edgewood. Josephs says he now takes two dozen pills daily. His symptoms vary from day to day. Sometimes, he has trouble swallowing. Other times, he experiences numbness in his joints or or tremors. He says he tires easily. He blames his time at Edgewood for all this, and he has joined a lawsuit on behalf of Edgewood veterans seeking medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Read the lawsuit complaint document (PDF) Read about an Edgewood volunteer's widow who blames the VA for his death . Gordon Erspamer, lead attorney in the suit, has reviewed the partial Edgewood medical records that Josephs was able to obtain with the help of his wife. Erspamer said Josephs probably received an injection of sarin or another nerve gas, because the records show that he received the drug P2S on February 1, 1968, to treat \"organophosphate poisoning.\" During experiments that began on February 19, 1968, Josephs experienced Parkinson's-like tremors after receiving Prolixin, an antipsychotic medication, Erspamer said, prompting the Edgewood medical staff to give the young soldier Congentin and Artane, two drugs used to treat Parkinson's symptoms. Erspamer said he sees a connection between Josephs' Parkinson's disease and the drugs he received at Edgewood. \"Those substances affect the same region of the brain,\" Erspamer said. \"Tim clearly had adverse health effects because they gave him such high doses that he ranged from overdose with one substance to the antidote, back and forth, and he actually had to get ... a very powerful antipsychotic drug because, in the vernacular, he flipped out.\" In addition to medical benefits, the lawsuit is asking that the Defense Department and Department of Veteran Affairs find all Edgewood veterans and provide them with details of the chemicals they received and their possible health effects. Erspamer said the government has reached very few of the 7,000 or so Edgewood veterans, and the VA has turned down almost all Edgewood-related health claims. Court documents show that the Veterans Benefits Administration rejected 84 of 86 health claims related to chemical or biological exposure. \"The whole thing stinks, and if the American people knew about it, they would not tolerate it. This kind of behavior toward our veterans would not be allowed to happen,\" Erspamer said. Josephs has not received any health benefits related to his time as a human test subject at Edgewood. \"They're hoping we die off, so you apply [for benefits], you get turned down,\" Josephs said. \"And it just goes on for years and years, and they just want to wear us down. They want to use young men as guinea pigs and throw them away.\" The Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs declined face-to-face interviews with CNN, citing pending litigation. In a statement, the Defense Department said that it \"has made it a priority to identify all service members exposed to chemical and biological substances ... and the VA has contacted and offered free medical evaluations to thousands of veterans.\" Josephs received his letter from the VA in 2008, four decades after he arrived at the Maryland base. \"In order to best serve veterans and their families, VA continues to study the possibility of long-term health effects associated with in-service exposure to chemical and biological weapons,\" the letter promised. At the Army's request, The Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit organization that is the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, produced a three-volume report in the 1980s on the long-term health of Edgewood veterans. The IOM decided in the end there wasn't enough information to reach \"definitive conclusions.\" Josephs enlisted in the military fresh out of high school -- at the height of the Vietnam War. \"I really felt a duty to my country to go and serve,\" he said. \"Things were different back then. You believed in your government. And you just wouldn't think they would give you something that would harm you intentionally.\"\n\n**News 4**:\nStaring out over Iceland's Svinafellsjokull glacier, a cruel, frozen landscape of white ice broken by blue crevasses, it's easy to imagine myself in some distant world on the other side of the universe. It's bleak and cold, but beautiful in an otherworldly way. This is the stand-in for an alien world that director Christopher Nolan used for his doom-laden new movie \"Interstellar,\" instead of spending squillions on CGI backdrops. In the film -- released by Warner Bros, which like CNN is owned by TimeWarner -- astronauts played by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway plunge through a space wormhole in search of an alternative to a dying Earth. While the plot might be baffling, if some reviews are to be believed, the reason for choosing Svinafellsjokull isn't. Forged by harsh winters and angry volcanic forces, it's like nowhere else I've seen on Earth -- cinematic. The same can be said for many other locations in Iceland, which is why the country's become a go-to destination for a slew of sci-fi directors. Hostile planet . Svinafellsjokull doesn't have a lengthy role in \"Interstellar,\" but it's featured strongly in posters and trailer scenes showing McConaughey walking across a hostile, wintry terrain. It looks so incredible, I wanted to see it for myself. Reaching Svinafellsjokull is easier than blasting through an intergalactic breach, but only just. What should be a five-hour drive along the southern stretch of Iceland's Highway 1 -- for most parts a two-lane blacktop that loops from Reykjavik around the country's perimeter -- is made longer by frequent stops for slack-jawed gawping at mind-boggling scenery. There are snow-capped volcanoes, plunging waterfalls, terrible cliffs and bizarre petrified landscapes coated with lurid green moss. At one point the road crosses a broad, featureless lava field whose pitch-dark terrain is only rendered distinguishable from the highway by painted white lines. I arrive at the glacier as night falls and spend the night at the Hotel Skaftafell (Skaftafelli 2 Freysnesi, 785 Orafi; +354 478 1945), an unfussy but welcoming stop in the bleak shadow of the ice field that's equipped with an excellent restaurant and talented wait staff. The hotel was used as a watering hole for the \"Interstellar\" crew in September 2013, but if the receptionist at the front desk was left starstruck by the celebs passing through its sliding doors, she isn't letting on. \"We've had lots of them,\" she says dismissively. \"They're always filming here.\" Jagged world . Daylight arrives after 9 a.m. -- it's late October -- and brings with it views of clouded mountains. A weak sun pushes its way over the southern horizon and the temperature hovers a couple of notches above freezing. At a nearby hut operated by Icelandic Mountain Guides, I join a small group embarking on a hiking tour of the glacier. We're kitted out with crampons and ice axes. Our guide, Tomas, gives us a rudimentary lesson in staying upright on the ice. \"Walk like a cowboy, not a ballerina,\" he advises, chiefly to ensure we don't impale ourselves on our own spikes, but also for better balance. And then we're let loose on the glacier. Svinafellsjokull lies at the foot of Vatnajokull, said to be the largest glacier outside of polar regions. Awestruck by the sheer bombast of the jagged world stretching ahead of us, we're silent at first. The only sounds are our crampons scraping the ice and winds howling higher up the mountain. I'm by no means alone -- there are eight of us in our group, plus another huddled about half a mile away -- but looking out over this huge, empty expanse of vicious ridges stretching up to Vatnajokull, there's a daunting sense of being a long way from home. Before we get too overwhelmed, Tomas leads us up and down the great folds in the ice to the brink of yawning crevasses where glassy, blue ice plunges to unknown depths. To gauge one, he hurls down a boulder and we listen to it clatter against the fissure's walls. It's a long way down. Tomas says the glacier is advancing up to 65 meters (213 feet) per year, although summer temperatures melt back two-thirds of that advance. Friction as the massive weight of ice creeps forward over the rocks below causes new crevasses to open up and old ones to close. Higher up the hillside, where the ice began its journey about 200 years ago, it can reach depths of up to a kilometer. The size of the fissures there make the higher reaches impassable on foot. Frozen carcasses . Tomas tells us of farmers who lost sheep to holes in the ice, only to recover them as \"frozen meals\" when the glacier spat them years later. There's also a tragic, true story about two British scientists who went missing on the mountain above during an expedition in the 1950s. Decades later, what is believed to be their equipment emerged from the ice and is now on display in the glacier's visitor center. \"If you drop your iPhone here, you can probably come back and get in 20 years,\" says Tomas. \"There's a saying: whatever the ice takes, it always gives back.\" With these tales ringing in our ears, he takes us down into a moulin -- a smooth-sided tunnel carved through the ice by meltwaters that's as beautiful as it is claustrophobic. Then we're back out on the open ice, tramping on metal claws across the glistening geological maze that stretches away all around us. On our way back to firmer soil, Tomas shows us the icy expanse where the 350-strong cast and crew of \"Interstellar\" spent two weeks filming. \"They booked the whole glacier right at the height of the season,\" he says. \"They built their own road to drive vehicles onto the glacier and even brought a spaceship.\" Today there's no sign they were ever here. Any trace of their presence has long since been swallowed by the advancing ice. Lost, in space. Lights, camera, Iceland . It's not just \"Interstellar.\" Here are some of the other recent films that have used Iceland to double for fictional realms. \"Prometheus\" Ridley Scott's pompous \"Aliens\" prequel may have failed to live up to the hype, but that wasn't Iceland's fault. The country's glowering landscape was used as a stand-in for a prehistoric Earth visited by a pallid alien creature clad only in underpants. Among key locations was Detifoss, a thundering waterfall at the far north of the Vatnajokull National Park. \"Game of Thrones\" There aren't many good-looking locations in Europe that haven't been plundered by this beard-heavy TV show about squabbling nobility, so little surprise Iceland has been featured. Hverfjall volcano, close to northern Iceland's Lake Myvatin, has cropped up in the long-running series, portraying the wintry land of Westeros. The southwestern Thingvellir National Park and the northern Godafoss waterfall have also made appearances. \"Batman Begins\" \"Interstellar\" director Christopher Nolan is a return visitor to Iceland. His 2005 reboot of the caped crusader series, \"Batman Begins,\" brought him to Jokulsarlon, a breathtakingly beautiful glacial lagoon to the east of Svinafellsjokull that can be visited on the same day. There are daily boat trips among the lagoon's stunning blue icebergs to watch seals hunting for fish. Two Bond movies -- \"Die Another Day\" and \"A View to A Kill\" -- had parts filmed here, as did \"Tomb Raider.\" \"Noah\" Not even \"Noah\" star Russell Crowe could chew the scenery in Iceland, which is possibly why director Darren Aronofsky filmed his recent biblical epic here. The tale of flood and salvation used the dramatic basalt scenery of Reynisdrangar and Dyrholaey near the town of Vik -- on the road to Svinafellsjokull -- to stand in for antediluvian Earth. Tours of Svinafellsjokull can be arranged through Icelandic Mountain Guides; +354 587 9999 ."}
{"tokens_range": "8k", "total_prompt_tokens": 7514, "how_many_news": 4, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-train", "content": "**News 1**:\n(CNN) -- He has sculpted a new career, much to the relief of his body. Where once it was concussions and broken bones Philip Blacker had to contend with, now the former British jockey works with clay molds and bronze casts. To the casual racegoer, the 64-year-old sculptor's work will already be well known -- his trademark life-size models of celebrated racehorses are dotted around racecourses, stables and the homes of wealthy horse owners across England and the world.Â . \"Racing was my first love,\" he says of a 13-year-old riding career, which included 340 winners and in which he came close to winning the prestigious Grand National. Now he is consumed by a love of art. His latest exhibition is a series of bronze friezes, which also feature a number of horses, though with a more somber theme in bearing witness to World War I's 100th anniversary. Entitled \"Farewell, Leicester Square\" the friezes capture the horrors of that conflict in graphic detail. Before discovering a gift for sculpture, Blacker initially struggled to adjust to life out of the saddle, missing the adrenalin fix the sport had given him. \"You name it, I tried it -- all sorts of dangerous things,\" recalls Blacker, \"jumping out of an airplane, riding motorcycles very fast, that sort of thing. \"It was about five years of trying to seek a substitute but it wore off.\" So the former art student, who realized an aptitude for sculpting during the latter part of his jockey career, began to pursue the discipline more seriously after finally hanging up his silks. \"The sculpture is exciting in a similar way -- it's like itching for a ride, the way you want to get into a studio if a piece of work is going well,\" he explains. \"When you're into a work it's mesmerizing. It's your total focus -- that's the same for a four-minute horse race to sculpture being a slow-motion version.\" Blacker's first big work was a life-sized version of three-time National winner Red Rum in 1988 which still takes pride of place at Aintree Racecourse. He has also sculpted Desert Orchid, the famous gray steeplechaser, for Kempton Park Racecourse, as well as former Kentucky Derby winner Northern Dancer for Woodbine in Canada. Red Rum was a horse which in some ways defines Blacker's two lives. In 1973, Blacker finished fourth on Spanish Steps as Red Rum won the National for the first time, while four years later he rode Happy Ranger to seventh in 1977 as the heralded bay gelding sealed a third victory over the Aintree fences. Red Rum became something of a sporting celebrity in the British psyche, not falling in 100 races, and his third win is regarded as one of the greatest moments in British sporting history. An event often referred to as the \"the ultimate test of a horse's courage\" and the richest jump race in Europe with a prize fund of Â£1 million ($1.6 million) -- the Grand National is tinged with frustration for Blacker. He believes he could and should have won the race in 1982 on board favorite Royal Mail. But the day before, against the advice of his trainer, he went to ride at Ludlow, only to fall at the last fence of the final race of the day. It ended with him being taken to hospital with a broken shoulder and, in his absence the next day, Royal Mail fell at Becher's Brook. \"That horse needed a rider that knew him and on that day he didn't, so I really saw that as my one big chance to win the race,\" says Blacker, who placed in the top four on three occasions at Aintree. \"But stupidly I threw it away. It's one of the biggest regrets of my life.\" The National is a race he loved, one he rode well and one where he embraced the potential perils, falling to the turf for four of his nine rides in the race. \"I had too much fun,\" says Blacker as he looks back on his career. \"When I look at a jockey like Tony McCoy -- notorious for his relentless pursuit for riding perfection -- perhaps I wasn't as dedicated as I might have been. There were missed opportunities, I could have done better.\" Instead with Red Rum and his other equine creations, Blacker has become the McCoy of equine sculpture, successfully allowing his initial passion to still live on through his art work. Each one is created initially from a 1/16th-size model made of wire with clay molded around it before ironing out any issues. That then becomes a life-size model, with about three-quarters of a ton of clay used before the foundry comes in to take molds and the cast before the final creation is set in bronze. Blacker's latest show is perhaps a nod to his father, Cecil Blacker, a former general in the British Army, who also passed on his equine passion as a show jumper and steeplechaser to his son. His son, however, was unaware of his father's military exploits until reading his 1993 autobiography. Blacker Sr. was the recipient of the Military Cross, one of only 50,000 ever awarded, in his case for his role in the three-day Operation Goodwood against Nazi forces in Normandy in 1944. He was later General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Northern Ireland just before the start of \"The Troubles\" -- bloody conflict between Irish republicans and the British government that began in the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. In 1974, Blacker's father's home was badly damaged by an IRA bomb. \"I read about that but honestly I can't remember anything about it at the time,\" admits his son. \"It's bad but I was so busy trying to ride winners that I don't think I paid too much interest. \"He kept that sort of thing quiet. Of course, I realized he might be a target as a high-ranking officer but, really, that incident passed me by.\" Blacker's military friezes are made in bronze with a patina (or thin layer of chemical on top) which is blow-torched, thereby causing a reaction that changes the color of the metal, producing haunting images. Further inspiration was derived by an earlier commission from former jockey and now journalist Brough Scott to depict Warrior, a famous military horse. Scott had once tried to persuade Blacker to give up riding after yet another crash, and move into art full-time. \"He didn't listen, carried on and finished third in the 1981 Grand National,\" recalls Scott. \"In fact, that year the top three jockeys I'd advised all of them to pack it in. What do I know, hey?\" Scott argues his good friend was perhaps initially overshadowed by Sir Cecil, who was knighted in 1969. \"It was difficult as his father was this amazing overachiever -- he had a picture in the Royal Academy, an article in the Spectator and rode a winner at Sandown all in the same week,\" Scott says. \"So initially I think Philip went the other way, a bit of an underachiever. But actually he's rather extraordinary -- he became a thoroughly good jockey and then the sculpting. He kept that to himself initially and his latest exhibition is wonderful, really quite daring. \"I remember his son getting into music so he decided to take up the saxophone and taught himself. Now he's very accomplished.\" Blacker's artistic pathway has not been without its troubles -- his studio has twice suffered from nearby fires. In the first, his work was untouched, but in the second molds which had taken weeks to create make were ruined. Recently relocated to Wiltshire in the southwest of England, such fires are hopefully a thing of the past but when most are ready for retirement, Blacker, having gone from Grand National to grand designs, has no plans to call it quits. \"I'm a workaholic so I can't,\" he says, driven by making his next piece of art better than the last. Casting his mind three decades back, retirement from riding was something a relief, the pressure of having to make racing weight of 64 kilograms no longer a requirement, nor having to contend with a litany of injuries: four broken wrists, a fractured femur and all manner of concussions. Becher's Brook -- that famous Grand National fence -- is no longer the driving force, more Flanders Fields. \"Farewell, Leicester Square\" is on show at London's Thompson Gallery from November 6-15.\n\n**News 2**:\nLibyans cheered the fate of ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi into the early hours of Friday after his death in what Libya's transitional prime minister described as a crossfire that followed his arrest by revolutionary forces. \"This is a time to start a new Libya, with a new economy, with a new education and with a new health system -- with one future,\" Mahmoud Jibril, Libya's transitional prime minister, said after proclaiming Gadhafi's death. Gadhafi was captured alive and unharmed as troops from the National Transitional Council overran his hometown of Sirte on Thursday, Jibril said. But a gunbattle erupted between transitional council fighters and Gadhafi's supporters as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle, Jibril said, leaving Gadhafi with a wound to his right arm. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi -- who ruled Libya for nearly 42 years before rebel forces overthrew him in August -- was hit in the head, Jibril said, Gadhafi died moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner. Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks captured some of the onetime Libyan strongman's last moments, as the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi was being hauled onto a truck. Another video showed a dead Gadhafi with what appeared to be a head wound. According to Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, troops found Gadhafi in a large drainage pipe. Daily Telegraph reporter Ben Farmer in Sirte old CNN's Anderson Cooper the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand. The phrases \"The place of the rat Gadhafi\" and \"You scum\" were painted around its exterior, apparently after the capture. Jibril said Gadhafi was carrying a gun but did not resist his captors. Jibril said DNA samples confirmed Gadhafi's identity, and the International Criminal Court -- which had issued an arrest warrant for the ousted dictator on war-crimes charges -- has agreed to allow Gadhafi's burial. Aujali said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes. In one video from the scene, a voice can be heard shouting, \"No, no, we want him alive, we want him alive.\" U.S., NATO and French officials said transitional government fighters captured Gadhafi's convoy after French warplanes and a U.S. drone forced it to a halt on the way out of Sirte. Following Gadhafi's death, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Thursday that the alliance \"will terminate our mission,\" launched in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. Amnesty International called for the National Transitional Council to mount \"a full, independent and impartial inquiry\" into Gadhafi's death and said his inner circle and family should be \"treated humanely and, if captured, given fair trials.\" Abubaker Saad, who was a Gadhafi aide for nine years, said it didn't really matter whether Gadhafi was dead or alive as long as he was no longer a fugitive. \"As long as he was on the run, he represented a very ominous danger to the Libyan people,\" Saad said. \"He represented a very ominous danger ... to the idea of the democracy in Libya.\" The streets of Tripoli echoed with celebratory gunfire, car horns and cheers as crowds ran or danced through the streets. Celebrations extended into early Friday in Tripoli and Misrata, where crowds waved flags in the city's main square long after midnight. On the surrounding roads, drivers leaned on their horns and came to brake-squealing stops as bands of revelers darted in and out of traffic. \"A black era has come to an end forever,\" the Libyan ambassador to Britain, Mahmoud Al Nacoua, said in London. National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil will officially announce on Saturday Libya's liberation, media committee member Mohamed Elkish told CNN on Thursday.  Council officials have said after such a declaration a new government would soon be announced and the democratic transition would begin. Gadhafi's killing caps a revolt that began in February and left him a fugitive for the past two months. The mercurial former army officer, who seized power in a 1969 coup, was the third Arab leader ousted in the Arab Spring upheavals that began in neighboring Tunisia in January. Also killed Thursday were Gadhafi's son Motassim and his chief of intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, said Anees al-Sharif, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council's military arm in Tripoli. Other reports say al-Senussi was captured. Jibril said Gadhafi's defense minister, Gen. Abu Baker Younes, also died. Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics, said Libyans still face a difficult political struggle. But, he added, \"We should not underestimate the significance of this day.\" \"Gadhafi was the head of the state, the most important symbol of the country. He repeatedly tried to rally his supporters to fight on,\" Gerges said. \"I hope that this particular day will not just mean the end of an era, but basically represent the beginning of a new era.\" Gerges said the recent fighting around Sirte and another holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists, Bani Walid, exposed \"some major tribal and regional cleavages\" that Libyans will have to bridge in forming a new government. Those differences \"could easily escalate, given the extent and the intensity of differences in Libya.\" But he said Gadhafi's death sends a signal to other strongmen in the region: \"If you oppress your people, if you don't engage your civil society, if you stay in power for so many years, this will be your end.\" Fran Townsend, CNN national security contributor, said the transitional leadership \"faces very serious challenges,\" citing groups outside Libya's borders, including al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as internal strife among the country's tribes. \"There will be those around them who seek to take advantage,\" Townsend said. \"There will be tribal differences, there will be Gadhafi loyalists who melt into the population and attempt to launch an insurgency like what we saw in Iraq.\" Prince Idris Al-Senussi, whose family was overthrown by Gadhafi 42 years ago, told CNN, \"I feel now that finally I can go back to a free country.  A country that I have loved ... and I feel proud that the Libyan people have done it themselves.\" The confirmation of Gadhafi's death came after hours of conflicting reports on the deposed leader's status. When those reports first reached U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a visit to Afghanistan, she reacted with one word: \"Wow.\" Clinton said the end of Gadhafi would \"add legitimacy and relief to the formation of a new government.\" In a brief address from the White House, President Barack Obama praised Libyans for lifting \"the dark shadow of tyranny\" with the aid of Western air power. \"One year ago, the notion of a free Libya seemed impossible,\" Obama said. \"But then the Libyan people rose up and demanded their rights. And when Gadhafi and his forces started going city to city, town by town, to brutalize men, women and children, the world refused to stand idly by.\" NATO, spearheaded by Britain and France, backed up the revolt by bombarding pro-Gadhafi forces. In a statement from his office, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Gadhafi's ouster marks the start of \"a new era ... one of reconciliation in unity and freedom.\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday \"is a day to remember all of Colonel Gadhafi's victims,\" including the 270 dead in the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and \"the many, many Libyans who died at the hands of this brutal dictator and his regime.\" Other world leaders sounded encouragement for a new Libya, but cautioned that the road ahead won't be easy. \"In the coming days, we will witness scenes of celebration, as well as grief for those who lost so much,\" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. \"Yet let us recognize, immediately, that this is only the end of the beginning. The road ahead for Libya and its people will be difficult and full of challenges.\"\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- Is college worth the cost? The question has echoed in the halls of government, over the family dinner table and throughout the media for decades. But the alarm bell has rung even louder in recent years, when student loan debt in the United States grew to over $1.2 trillion and tuition increases continued at nearly triple the rate of inflation. Just this summer the debate about the cost of college seemed to reach a fever pitch, as dueling perspectives seized national headlines. On the one hand, Senator Elizabeth Warren bemoaned the fact that \"Millions of young people... can't buy homes, they can't buy cars ... all because they are struggling under the weight of student loan debt.\" In the same vein, President Obama declared that \"we're still seeing too big a debt load on too many young people\" as he signed an Executive action that would extend income-based repayment programs for graduates who can't earn enough to handle loan payments. But on the other hand, a Brookings Institution study released just days later offered a starkly different message. Prominently covered by the News/Opinion vertical at The New York Times called \"The Upshot,\" the study said that \"the impact of student loans may not be as dire as many commentators fear.\" David Leonhardt of the New York Times crystallized the argument with a headline reading, \"The Reality of Student Debt is Different From the Cliches.\" He pointed out that students with six figure debt loads represent a fraction of the overall picture and cited data that the ratio of borrowers' monthly loan payments to monthly income has remained consistent when measured since the early 1990s. The authors of the study further questioned whether student debt was creating any kind of drag on the economy at all. So the question arose, was all this effort for student loan reform at the highest level of government an overreaction? Perhaps just a symptom of simplistic media coverage? Was The New York Times' own magazine cover about \"boomerang kids\" (featuring a recent graduate with $80,000 in debt living at home) or  its front-page series on \"Degrees of Debt\" (featuring \"a generation hobbled by the soaring cost of college\") just another media clichÃ©? Certainly a media organization can accommodate competing perspectives, but was the take away that we should finally stop worrying and sign every student up for more loans already? It became quickly apparent, however, that the Brookings study had its flaws. One notable omission was the fact that 70% of the class of 2014 would graduate with an average debt of $33,000 per borrower, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Analysts also criticized various aspects of the study's method. For example, using data from 2010, the Brookings authors define \"young households\" as homes headed by people ages 20-40. This dataset includes people who graduated college in the early-1990s, when average debt per borrower was less than half what it is today. Perhaps even more importantly, this dataset excludes young people still living at home with their parents and therefore not the heads of their households. Such an exclusion is significant, since one in five college graduates under age 35 still live at home, and they are most likely the graduates with the highest debt levels (hence the phenomenon of \"boomerang kids\"). Another important caveat is the fact that the average repayment period on student loans has increased from 7.4 years in 1992 to 13.4 years today. So while monthly payments may be similar to what they were twenty years ago, they now last for almost double the time. This is where the meme of \"student debt slavery\" enters the conversation. It used to be the case that student loan debt could be paid off by the time one might decide to start a family and buy a home. But now, there is a sense that student loan debt will haunt borrowers deep into adulthood, negatively affecting their ability to make life choices that are part of a healthy future and a key to the health of our economy. Perhaps the biggest oversight in the Brookings study, though, is that the data includes only borrowers actually making monthly repayments on their debt. Thus the study doesn't include all those who are in default, deferment or forbearance. And as data released in August revealed, less than half of student borrowers are actually paying their federal loans back on time, with defaults on the rise. So the Brookings argument reads a bit like a tautology: those who are not having trouble paying back their loans are not having trouble paying back their loans. But lets take a step back from all of this data-crunching about student debt, and consider an even more fundamental question: is higher education a public good that benefits the whole country, or is it simply a private good that adds to an individual's net worth? This is the culturo-historical perspective that Ivory Tower seeks to explore in order to come to a more nuanced understanding of whether college is worth the cost. From the arrival of the first colonists in New England, college in America has been a place for the moral development and intellectual uplift of young people. By the time of our nation's founding, college had expanded from an institution simply meant to train the clergy to a critical component of a nascent democracy. An educated citizenry, according to Jefferson, was the best defense against tyranny. With the emergence of a new industrial economy in the 19th Century, college education became both a source of individual edification and national prosperity, and with the Morrill Acts of 1865 and 1890, the federal government created free (or nearly free) institutions accessible to people who never would have dreamed of going to college before. Private institutions also embraced this notion of education as a public good, with the wealthiest philanthropists of the era, such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Peter Cooper endowing institutions for the benefit of both individual students and the broader society. In the 20th Century, the GI Bill of 1944 continued this tradition, offering free college education to millions of returning veterans, and laying the groundwork for an economic boom and vast expansion of the middle class. The federal student loan program itself began as a small part of Lyndon Johnson's vision for a Great Society, as he aimed to increase access to college through the Higher Education Act of 1965. But by the 1970s, this tradition was derailed, and the emphasis shifted to the private good of education. State legislatures, inspired by the example of Ronald Reagan, made the argument that if students were receiving a wage premium from college, they should pay for it themselves. This attitude resulted in shifting the cost of college increasingly onto the shoulders of individual students through more and more student loans. At the same time, colleges and universities have found themselves in an ever more perverse arms race to compete with each other. As students have become more like customers, colleges have become more like businesses trying to attract those customers with fancier dormitories, recreation centers, and other amenities not essential to their core academic mission. And while the soaring \"sticker price\" of college has been at least somewhat offset at many institutions by increased financial aid, many of those discount packages actually include loans. Indeed, only 1.25% of the over four thousand institutions of higher education in the country offer financial aid that meets a student's full need. Returning to data and statistics, perhaps the most significant number one can cite in terms of the value of college is the $1 million lifetime earnings premium a bachelor's degree confers. For some, this statistic puts the debate about whether college is worth it to rest. But while we can say that statistically a bachelor's degree is worth it, that does not mean \"college\" as a whole is worth the cost. Indeed, 68% of students at public institutions do not graduate in 4 years, and 44% fail to graduate in 6 years. That means that nearly half of the students who are signing up for a public university education will not enjoy the wage premium promised to them, yet they may still be saddled with debt. For students like these, the question of whether college is worth it is far more complicated. And in an economy where the disparity between the wealth of high school graduates and college graduates is increasingly stark, the choice to not go to college seems like financial suicide, even if the choice to take on debt may seem very risky as well. As Anthony Carnevale from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce puts it, \"The only thing worse than going to college is not going to college.\" Ultimately, our society should not put so many young people, especially those from less advantaged backgrounds, in such a precarious position, particularly when the potential value of a college education for both students and society is so high.

Bush of helping terrorism and seeking weapons of mass destruction, along with fellow \"axis of evil\" countries, Iran and Iraq. Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown after the U.S. invaded in 2003 but the other two countries continued to defy the West by pursuing a nuclear program. So what will happen next after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il? How will the death affect military tensions in the region? After Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea became a divided nation. The capitalist South was supported by the United States and its Western allies, and the communist North became an ally of the Soviet Union. Cold War tensions erupted in 1950 as the North invaded the South, devastating the peninsula and killing up to two million people before the fighting ended after three years with a truce, followed by an armistice. Technically, the two Koreas remain at war, and while the North is believed to have a standing army of one million soldiers, with reserves estimated at more than seven million, few expect it to launch a general assault on the South. What military hardware does North Korea have? Over the past six decades, skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders. Deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999, 2002, 2009 and 2010. Washington also accuses Pyongyang of running a secret uranium-based nuclear program. The United States, along with the two Koreas, Russia, Japan and China, have been involved in what is called the Six Party Talks, but those negotiations have been slow and arduous. Following Kim Jong Il's death, Pyongyang urged an increase in the North's \"military capability,\" prompting Seoul to put South Korean forces on high alert. Martin Navias, from the London-based Centre for Defence Studies, said South Korea raised its alert because it feared Kim Jong Un could be forced to show his toughness with \"saber-rattling\" and flex the North's military muscles. CNN's Christiane Amanpour said it remained to be seen how talks would be affected. \"The issue here,\" she said, \"is whether it will promote more hardline policies from some of the old guard. Whether they will circle the wagons around this young man and whether it will put a stop to the negotiations with the United States or whether they will go through nonetheless.\" What, if anything, will change inside the country? The state structure in North Korea, the police, security and military apparatus, is extremely strong, said Peter Beck, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \"The idea of people rising up is hard to imagine,\" Beck told CNN. Short-term, Beck said, the Pyongyang regime could hunker down and \"remain stable and inward-oriented, sorting out who is in and who is out.\" What is in store for North Korea? | Life inside the secretive country . North Korea's Stalinist government has survived mostly by closing itself off and defying the rest of the world. The question is, will this strategy continue to work in the years ahead for the third of the Kim dynasty to rule North Korea? \"The news of the death of Kim Jong Il opens a new chapter in the life of this isolated and repressive regime as it negotiates food aid to stave off starvation for its people and attempts to revive economy amid international concerns over its nuclear ambitions,\" said New York-based Vishakha Desai, Asia Society president who visited North Korea six months ago. So will the country's Stalinist regime endure? Kim's death could provide an opportunity for change, or trigger instability and even chaos. His son, the \"Great Successor\" Kim Jong Un, now inherits a reclusive, unstable regime confronting political uncertainty, diplomatic isolation, economic malaise and food shortages. North Korea has been dogged by famine since the mid-1990s when it was hit by severe food shortage caused by floods, drought and economic mismanagement. United Nations agencies based in Pyongyang say the North is in desperate need of outside aid to feed its 24 million people. GPS: Can Kim's son survive? In recent years, DVDs smuggled in from abroad showing South Korean soap operas have become popular, according to CNN producer Tim Schwarz, who has visited the country. \"The difference today is that North Koreans are no longer under the illusion they are living in paradise on earth. It is vital for the government to improve their economic prospects. But the state still controls people's lives to an extent almost unimaginable anywhere else. \"What may have an influence is Kim Jong Un's privileged upbringing. He has had an unobstructed view of the outside world that few in his country can have had. He was educated partly in a Swiss secondary school. His friends were ordinary European teenagers and he is reportedly a fan of NBA basketball. So it would be reasonable to think that this could give him a more modern outlook. \"It is hard to imagine that North Korea in the second decade of the 21st century will remain in the same kind of time warp as it seemed to be from in the last decades of the 20th. But don't expect Arab Spring-type changes. Even a move to Chinese style market socialism is a long way away.\" What is China's role? A significant number of North Koreans have fled to China to seek freedom and a better life. In recent years, economic desperation and diplomatic isolation have prompted Kim Jong Il to visit frequently close allies like China. Why does China support North Korea? Last May, Kim Jong Il visited China again to ask for continued economic and military aid and political support. On this trip Kim went with another urgent mission: to introduce to the Chinese senior leaders his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, as his heir apparent. As North Korea's major ally, experts say, China's support for the young Kim was important. China-North Korean ties are so close they are frequently described \"as close as lips and teeth,\" and the two neighbors were Korean War allies. Of all the regional powers, Beijing has the greatest potential leverage over Pyongyang. China supplies at least 80% of North Korea's oil and significant amounts of food, fertilizer and military aid. The two Communist neighbors have frequent political, military and party-to-party exchanges. Foremost in Beijing's mind, North Korea serves as a buffer, keeping the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea away from the Chinese border. China has a huge stake in North Korea's stability, experts believe. Former CNN correspondent, Mike Chinoy, a veteran Korea-watcher who has visited North Korea several times, said: \"The Chinese have made it extremely clear that they are not going to let Korea go down the drain. They are going to do whatever they need to do to prop it up.\" And how will Kim Jong Un fare? Meantime, experts say, all eyes are on the young and untested Kim Jong Un. Why Kim Jong Un remains an enigma . Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the Los Angeles-based U.S. China Institute, notes the young Kim's big challenge: \"How does somebody who's not yet 30 win the loyalty and respect and command authority over the entrenched party apparatus, the entrenched military bureaucracy, and the senior party officials who may have been in their positions for a long time?\" Kim Jong Il had two decades to learn the ropes, develop his network of connections and establish his authority under his father, Kim Il Sung's tutelage and protection. Even so, Chinoy said, when Kim Il Sung died in 1994, the young Kim was dogged with speculations: \"Was he going to last?\" By contrast, Kim Jong Un only had two years to ascend last year as a senior party leader and four-star general. The young Kim is expected to rely on powerful backers of close relatives, including Kim's sister and brother-in-law Jang Song Taek, who experts say will serve as regents, tutoring behind the scene. So despite all the problems that Kim Jong Il left behind, some Korea-watchers do not expect North Korea to implode immediately. After his last visit to Pyongyang last August, Chinoy told CNN: \"I was struck by the notion that succession was on track -- not a lot of internal discord about it.\" Nor is any huge policy change expected. \"Kim has not been put into his position by a group of young Turks hoping to change the system, but by an elderly and entrenched elite,\" said CNN's Schwarz. \"Their interests lie firmly in continuing the current power structure. \"So while gradual change over time may be possible, if on a limited scale, the imminent collapse of the regime is unlikely.\""}

I care about football so what I am seeing regarding the image of FIFA, not only now but in the past years, I don't like it. \"I've been talking with so many people. Important people in football, football players, managers, presidents of federation, all these things they have to be done. \"Last year was a World Cup year and I was in Brazil and I saw the reaction of the fans regarding the image of FIFA. I think something had to be changed. A change in leadership, change in governance, in transparency and in solidarity, so I think it is the moment for that.\" AT: . \"You say you don't like what people have been saying to you about FIFA's image. What have they been telling you?\" LF: . \"Well all the people have the idea that a world organization like FIFA, an organization that has the power to, and the image of football for the world must be different. \"If you search right now FIFA, you know, on the internet, or communications... you see the first words that comes out are scandal -- not positive words regarding the name of FIFA.

Have you got those criteria?\" LF: . \"Well I know well the criteria for the candidate of the presidency of FIFA. In the past years I have been working in several roles in Inter Milan, in Portuguese national team, in UEFA, and I have the five letters of support from the different kind of national teams so I can say I am real candidate.

I think that life is a challenge and if you don't take the step to improve obviously that is not correct. I think if you don't have challenges every day... For me, it's about giving back to football so many things that football gives to me through my life. \"I think that is most important. I think we have to care about the future of football.

Of course this is a person that is running the organization for so long, since 1998 and for a lot of people he may be the favorite but I have to hope. \"I can say that for me it's a fantastic challenge to try to convince people to follow me and to support me. \"I have so many examples in football that play against the strongest team, can play against the weakest team, and you never know who is going to win. Sometimes you think that you're going to lose and you win, and sometimes you think we're going to win and you lose. That is the beauty of sport. That is the beauty of this challenge.\" AT: . \"This is harder than being a goal down, with five minutes to go, isn't it?\" LF: . \"Well it's not easy, you have to believe.

Obama's meeting in Warsaw, Poland, with Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko can be seen as a sign of U.S. support for the government in Kiev as it battles to quell a pro-Russian separatist uprising in Ukraine's East. Ukrainian authorities claimed Wednesday to have inflicted heavy losses on militant forces in the Donetsk region, at the same time as acknowledging that separatists have now seized two military bases in Luhansk. A separatist leader gave conflicting casualty figures. In remarks at a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of Poland's return to democracy, Obama also voiced his backing for Ukraine, and said the United States would stand up for freedom across the region. Poland and former Soviet states \"will never stand alone,\" Obama said. \"These are not just words. They are unbreakable commitments backed by the strongest alliance in the world and by the armed forces of the United States of America -- the most powerful military in history.\" Conflicting accounts in heightened eastern Ukraine fighting . He also vowed to stand with Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, in the face of Russian \"aggression,\" including its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March. \"Ukraine must be free to choose its own future, for itself and by itself,\" Obama said. \"We will not accept Russia's occupation of Crimea or its violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia.\" Obama, who spoke after Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at the solemn ceremony in the heart of Warsaw, also paid tribute to the Poles whose struggle for democracy lit a spark for revolutionary change. The 1989 election commemorated Wednesday \"was the beginning of the end of communism -- in this country and across Europe,\" he said. 'Deeply impressed' Addressing reporters earlier alongside Poroshenko, Obama said he was \"deeply impressed\" by the newly elected leader's vision of what is required to help Ukraine grow. \"The challenge now for the international community is to make sure that we are supportive of Petro's efforts, and the United States has already stepped up in a number of ways,\" he said. Obama said the pair had discussed additional steps the United States can take to help Ukraine through its transition process, including helping to train Ukrainian law enforcement officers and providing more nonlethal aid to its military. Deadly attack on pro-Russian separatists . He also spoke of the need for Ukraine to undertake economic reforms, including steps to reduce its dependence on natural gas supplies from Russia, currently used by Moscow as a means of leverage. Poroshenko, a business magnate seen as pro-European, is due to be sworn in Saturday. He thanked the United States for its support and said the Ukrainian people had shown their solidarity in rejecting Russia's annexation of Crimea. G7 diplomacy . The U.S. President then flew to Brussels, Belgium -- the second stop of his three-nation tour -- for a meeting of the G7 group of industrialized nations. Obama led the international effort to suspend Russia's participation in the world group of economic powers. That suspension resulted in the relocation of this year's planned G8 summit from Sochi, Russia, to Brussels, as the leaders of the G7 nations decided to meet without Russia. Obama suggested Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin could regain the trust \"shattered\" by Russia's incursion into Ukraine, but only if Moscow plays by the rules and stops destabilizing Ukraine. Putin \"has a choice to make\" on Ukraine, Obama said, calling on the Russian President to continue to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, persuade pro-Russian separatists to stand down and back Ukraine's recent presidential election. Obama and Putin are likely to cross paths while both are in France at the end of the week for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but no formal talks have been announced. Putin told French television station TF1 that he will not \"evade\" Poroshenko or anyone else. \"There will be other guests, and I'm not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,\" he said, according to the Kremlin's translation. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet Putin on the sidelines of the D-Day events Friday for discussions on Ukraine, the German government said. British Prime Minister David Cameron will meet the Russian leader on Thursday night, Downing Street said, adding that their talks will focus on steps Russia can take to de-escalate the crisis. Obama urges Putin to make choice over Ukraine . NATO defense ministers meet . Amid the heightened East-West tensions, NATO defense ministers met Wednesday in Brussels. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said before meeting it was a timely opportunity \"to discuss our shared concerns over Russia's illegal aggression against Ukraine.\" The alliance has come to the fore in recent weeks as former Soviet states which are now NATO members seek reassurance amid heightened concerns following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Obama on Tuesday announced that he would ask the U.S. Congress for a fund of up to $1 billion to allow for a \"European Reassurance Initiative\" to bolster the security of NATO allies. This would help the United States undertake increased training exercises, explore the prepositioning of military equipment, and build the capacity of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to partner with the United States and NATO. More U.S. Air Force and Army personnel will be rotated through allied countries in central and eastern Europe, Obama said. Recent moves by Russia to withdraw some of its forces from its border with Ukraine have the potential to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington. But administration officials caution a new detente is a long way off. Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia, a claim that Moscow denies. Separatists seize Ukraine military bases . The volatile situation in eastern Ukraine appears to have taken a turn for the worse this week. The Ukrainian government claimed Wednesday that more than 300 pro-Russian militants have been killed and at least 500 wounded in ongoing Ukrainian military operations in the towns of Chervoniy Liman and Slovyansk. CNN could not immediately confirm the report. However, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, told CNN that during Tuesday's attack by Ukrainian jets and helicopters, 10 separatist militants had died and 12 were injured. He added in the past three days, three civilians, including a woman, had died in the violence. The authorities also said that separatist fighters had taken over two military bases in Luhansk -- one run by the Border Guard and the other by the National Guard. The Ukrainian Border Guard base on the outskirts of Luhansk city has been evacuated and taken over by pro-Russia separatists, according to the Border Guard website. Ukrainian official: Five militants killed in attack on border guard base in Luhansk . The border guard detachment at the compound, which was badly damaged during 12 hours of clashes Monday, has been relocated to safe place, the Border Guard Service said. The Ukrainian National Guard said Wednesday it had lost control of its base after an attack by \"terrorists\" that began late Tuesday. Video appeared to show its detachment surrendering to separatists early Wednesday. The National Guard said its troops at the base had been relocated to \"a safe place.\" Three of its men were injured, while six of the attackers were killed, it said. CNN cannot independently confirm the number of casualties. Civilians killed . The loss of the military bases follows a deadly attack Monday on a regional headquarters building in Luhansk that had been taken over by separatists calling themselves the People's Republic of Luhansk. Five women and three men, all of them civilians, were killed in the attack, which Kiev blamed on separatists. A munitions expert who accompanied a CNN crew to the scene, however, said the damage to the building was indicative of an airstrike. Ukraine's President-elect vows vengeance over helicopter attack . The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe came to a similar conclusion. It's thought to be the first time that civilians have been killed or injured in an attack by the Ukrainian air force since pro-Russian groups began occupying buildings in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions more than two months ago. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, raised concern Tuesday over the plight of children caught up in the violence and urged all groups involved to protect children. Seven children, the youngest age 4, have sustained gunshot and shrapnel injuries in eastern Ukraine since May 9, the agency said, while others in Donetsk have been exposed to violence and terrifying events.\n\n**News 3**:\n(CNN) -- Memories of salvaging and stealing to avoid going hungry are part of the legacy of the Great Depression. Some iReporters say they can't help but look at the current economy and feel the past holds lessons for the present. Pam Van Hylckama Vlieg says her great grandfather tried to steal chickens after being laid off from mining. Donna LeBlanc of Waxia, Louisiana, says she carries no credit to this day as a result of the frugality and self-reliance instilled in her by her family. Her husband keeps the couple's credit card and maintains a zero balance. The Great Depression meant scary times for many households as a period of economic downturn spread throughout the world. Historians trace its start to the \"Black Tuesday\" stock crash on October 29, 1929, and argue that the resulting global desperation set the stage for World War II. LeBlanc said her grandparents were fortunate that they didn't have investments and could grow -- or catch -- their own food during the Depression years. Her grandfather Lester was a \"Cajun cowboy\" often seen wearing a cowboy hat, and her grandmother Ida was a resourceful woman who spent much of the 1930s working as a store clerk. LeBlanc, always told never to keep credit card debt, heard frightful stories from Ida. iReport.com: See a photo of the happy couple together after all these years . \"She remembered vividly the barrels of flour, the bolts of cloth and the hunger in the faces of people as they begged for store credit,\" LeBlanc said. \"The store must have been at least marginally successful, because my grandmother was able to purchase, a piece at a time, a complete six-person setting of Gorham Chantilly silverware for her trousseau, linens and even a Lane cedar chest to house her treasures.\" The couple would catch wild hogs, feed them corn for a year and eat them once the wild taste was out of the scavenging animals. They also took advantage of available squirrel meat, a common food in the South at that time. \"It was a uniquely disgusting thing ... to see my grandfather take a stewed, skinned squirrel's head, smack the skull's dome with a heavy silver tablespoon, and dine on the brains,\" LeBlanc said. Years after the Depression, LeBlanc's grandparents were well off once again. Ida became a packrat and couldn't help saving what she could. When the family opened up the old cedar chest after she died, they found a decades-old treasure trove of sewing materials and other keepsakes. iReport.com: \"My dad used to cry when he spoke of that Great Depression\" The Great Depression turned many Americans into packrats who couldn't bear to part with anything of potential value. They couldn't always afford to buy what they needed. Pam van Hylckama Vlieg of Williamsburg, Virginia, says her great grandfather, Glen Surber, resorted to stealing food at times because he had hit rock-bottom. Surber left the family behind in Saltville, Virginia, so he could head out to West Virginia's coal mines. After he got laid off, he found himself trying to steal chickens from a nearby farmer to feed his hungry family. He hid behind a tree to wait for nightfall, but his plan was stymied when he found another person lurking in the shadows. \"Both men took off running and then they realized they each thought the other was the farmer, but they were both there to steal a chicken,\" van Hylckama Vlieg said. \"Needless to say, that was another night of water bread.\" iReport.com: Can you imagine having to steal to eat? Digging into her memories, van Hylckama Vlieg says her great grandfather eventually found a work program after the New Deal and was able to rebuild his life. She is confident we haven't hit another Depression and that we've learned enough lessons from the past to avoid letting things get as bad as they were before. \"Poppy always said the world turns and everything that has happened would happen again. I am sure if he were still with us today he would be warning us to start a garden and buy some chickens.\" Saving is a habitual behavior for those who have lived through the Great Depression, says Anjanette Sanchez of Globe, Arizona. Her grandmother, Vera Vasquez, had a difficult time with the Great Depression and seemed to be scarred by it long after. \"She spoke of the time with great disgust in her voice as if it was the most awful time of her life,\" Sanchez said. \"She mostly spoke of being hungry and having to wear old boots that didn't fit.\" iReport.com: Read about those times when nothing could be wasted . Vasquez continued to save her things and always kept her freezer packed with food -- like frozen cactus to eat with her scrambled eggs -- because she'd lived through harsh times. There was never room for ice cubes. \"I guess to her, food was more valuable than ice,\" Sanchez said. \"Her motto at the table was to eat as much as you want, but not to waste the food. Take all you want, but eat all you take.\" Sanchez now passes on the same ideas to her children and reminds them not to be wasteful. iReport.com: Do you have a story about the Great Depression? Share it with us . Other iReporters had plenty to say, and shared their stories about the lessons they have learned and applied from the Great Depression: . Kimberly Kolaski of Richmond, Virginia, says her family's claim to fame is her great granduncle Paul Satko's remarkable attempt to travel to Alaska in a wooden ark to find land and a better life. He spent a couple of weeks making the treacherous trip on board the boat, termed the Ark of Juneau. \"He was on a mission and he was going to do it no matter what,\" Kolaski says. She's heard numerous stories about the hardships Satko endured, including being stopped while driving his unusual payload to Seattle, Washington, where the ark was to be launched. The story is inspirational for the family and provides a sobering lesson about economic security for Kolaski. iReport.com: Find out more about the ark and Satko's travels . \"I've learned to put my money away and don't touch it,\" she says. Sheila Elrod of Atlanta, Georgia, says many secrets to success have been passed along through the years in her family. \"My grandfather, born in 1898, was an established small businessman by 1929, owning and managing a gas station and grill patronized by the mill workers. As his children and grandchildren grew into adulthood, he reminded us of some guiding principles that he learned during the depression.\" Elrod says her grandmother worked inside the nearby mill because people of the time believed that one must \"work hard, regardless of your status.\" \"Oddly enough, she and her sisters were ladies that were taught all the graces of being ladies,\" Elrod said. \"However, here's an example that even ladies didn't shy away from hard work during that time. iReport.com: See a family photo and the mill where Elrod's grandmother worked . Elrod said her grandfather had to be careful to whom he gave credit and learned many smart business secrets along the way. He passed them along to Elrod: . Richard Holland of Phoenix, Arizona, says his grandfather packed up a Ford Model T in search of a better life. The family ended up taking shelter in a barn while Orville Holland continued onward to find work. \"In those days, telephones were few and far between across the Great Plains, and months elapsed with no word or money from my grandfather. The coming winter was a serious concern as they considered the threat of living in the unheated barn.\" iReport.com: Read the story of what it's like to have a family living in a barn . \"As fall approached, the story continues that my grandfather returned in a borrowed car. He had walked, hitchhiked and ridden the rails until he secured a job, saving every penny to finally rent a place for his family.\" Gayla Uslu of Conyers, Georgia, says she never understood why her grandmother was so big on saving plastic bowls and other packaging until now. \"She grew up in the depression and also lived in a rural area, far from the soup and bread lines in the urban areas. It wasn't just a matter of getting food, it has to be stored and kept long-term as well.\" iReport.com: Read about the moneysaving tips Uslu has learned . Uslu finds much to learn from her grandmother and catches herself doing the same things that mystified her before. \"Today, I find myself really thinking twice before I throw uneaten food away. Leftovers aren't such a bad idea anymore, and I find myself holding on to a few of those plastic containers myself.\"\n\n**News 4**:\nFor soccer's world governing body FIFA, it is an unwanted hat-trick. Brazil, who will stage the 2014 installment of FIFA's showpiece tournament -- the World Cup --  faced a wave of protests about the costs involved in playing host when the forerunner to the tournament, the Confederations Cup, took place in June. Recently FIFA have also appointed a task force to examine the possibility of moving the date of 2022 Qatar World Cup to escape the searing temperatures of the tiny emirate's Middle East summer. Sandwiched in between those two is Russia 2018, who are again having to field accusations of racism among supporters of one of their biggest clubs. Manchester City's Yaya Toure claims he was the subject of monkey chants from CSKA Moscow fans during their Champions League game on Wednesday and even raised the possibility of boycotting the 2018 World Cup. Ivory Coast international Toure declared himself \"furious\" and in an interview with City's TV channel called on UEFA -- European football's governing body  -- to impose tough sanctions on CSKA, and \"ban them for a couple of years.\" While UEFA confirmed they'd opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA for \"racist behavior of their fans\" after reports submitted from their two officials at the match, the club denies any allegations of racist behavior, and claim that UEFA's delegate didn't hear anything untoward. Toure's Ivory Coast teammate Seydou Doumbia, who played in the match for CSKA, said he had heard nothing in the way of monkey chants and told the club's official website Toure \"clearly got worked up.\" Doumbia distanced himself from those comments on Friday, saying he hadn't spoken to any journalists after the game. Whatever the outcome, the furore has provoked another wave of negative headlines about the World Cup and brought the issue of racial discrimination into sharp focus. Brazil's World Cup winning defender Roberto Carlos twice had a banana thrown at him from the stands in 2011 when playing for Anzhi Makhachkala in the volatile Dagestan region while Zenit St Petersburg were forced to distance themselves from a fans group who called for non-white and gay players to be excluded from the team. However, it is arguable that racism is way down the 2018 committee's to do list of priorities. \"There is still this attitude in Russia that the 2018 World Cup is a long way away and they have got all sorts of problems they need to tackle before they even get to the issue of racism,\" James Appell, a Moscow-based football journalist told CNN. \"I think the organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup has probably taken the decision that FIFA are much more concerned that the stadiums aren't going to be built, the roads will be bad and the railway links aren't going to be there by the time 2018 comes around.\" While FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared himself happy with Russia's preparations at a recent summit in Argentina, Appell argues infrastructure development remains a huge concern. \"So if a few thousand fans -- and I'm not trying to diminish the issue -- but if a few thousand fans air these chants in a Champions League game in the year 2013, they are pretty confident they can sweep that under the carpet, but they've got to get the transport, logistics and stadiums in order. \"There are 14 or 15 host stadiums, how many of them are ready today? None, not a single one. Some of them are built but need renovating; some haven't even been built yet. \"That is where FIFA can say we literally can't hold a major tournament here if you don't have stadiums or roads, so that is where the prime motivation is at the moment. \"To even get to the point where they can say 'Right, we've solved that problem' they are years away.\" Russia's organizing committee has insisted all stakeholders in Russian football have made it clear there is no place for racism in the game. It also pointed to a new 'Fans Law', ratified by President Vladimir Putin in July, that bolsters the sanctions available to the authorities when dealing with hooliganism by Russian fans, like stadium bans and harsher fines. \"What is clear is that football is uniquely positioned to educate fans in combating this global issue,\" said the Russia organizing committee in a statement sent to CNN. \"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, in particular, can act as a catalyst to positively change the mindsets and behavior across all involved in Russian football over the next four years. \"The Fans Law that was recently passed into legislation shows Russia's determination to eradicate the problem for good. The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia will be a festival of football where talented athletes from every corner of the globe will be celebrated.\" Asked if infrastructure projects were being prioritized ahead of tackling discrimination, the organizing committee declined to comment further. Outside of Russia, condemnation of the alleged monkey chants aimed at Toure was rapid, with the Professional Footballers' Association in England calling for swift action and the \"strongest possible sanctions.\" The worldwide professional players' union FIFPro said UEFA's own racism protocol \"failed\" Toure. FIFPro argued that after the 30-year-old Ivorian told referee Ovidiu Hategan of the alleged abuse, the official should have informed the safety officer to ensure a stadium announcement was made imploring fans to curtail their chants. If they persisted, the teams should then have been taken off the field. On Friday, UEFA president Michel Platini ordered an investigation into why the protocol wasn't followed. The British 'Kick it Out' campaign against racism called the incident a \"depressing throwback\" and said it raised questions around the suitability of Russia as World Cup hosts. However, one seasoned racism campaigner, Piara Powar, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) organisation, said it was unlikely that FIFA would consider replacing Russia as the host nation unless there was a wide scale boycott by the players involved. \"I'm very confident that when it comes to the World Cup, the government, the football authorities will make sure that in terms of racism it's a very clean World Cup -- I don't think that is in doubt,\" he told CNN. CNN investigates: Racism in Football . \"Generally when these big tournaments take place the country rises to the occasion and people understand their responsibilities. \"I think the wider issue is the one that Yaya Toure has highlighted, which is that if the government and the football authorities in Russia can't come to terms with this, then should the World Cup be played there? \"I think it's probably too late for that but he also raises the prospect of players boycotting the tournament, that has never happened before and in the end if the African players were to do that then there wouldn't be a World Cup.\" One of the most high-profile footballers ever to play in Russia was Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o, twice a Champions League winner with Barcelona and a four-time African Player of the Year. He spent two years with Anzhi, playing a season alongside Carlos, and told CNN recently that in his experience of Russia, the ultras there are no more or less racist than in other countries. \"Racism wasn't born in Russia,\" said Chelsea striker Eto'o. \"The first time I played in St. Petersburg, a lot of people told me, \"Whoa, watch out there,\" when I came out onto the pitch to warm up, the fans stood up and applauded me. \"Racism is a question of education -- you get to one place and, in the moment, they do it to you. Or a lot of times, in the stadium, they do it to certain players -- not to offend you -- but to make you lose your concentration. \"And I'll tell you what, same as they said about the World Cup in South Africa, Russia will be one of the best World Cups we'll ever have.\" Yet Appell insists there won't be an appetite to fight racism head on in Russia until the punishments meted out to clubs do them real damage. \"Futile is the word for potential punishments because there is no fear of any serious consequences,\" said Appell. \"It has to be something on the horizon that is immediate and would affect all fans. \"There are certain things I think UEFA could do that might make a lot of Russian fans sit up and take note that would involve banning their clubs from playing in Europe or a serious sanction involving next year's World Cup. \"What is key for the clubs is television revenue and the prize money they get from competing in Europe.  As far as they are concerned fan behavior is an inconvenience but it isn't the be all and end all. \"What would affect them is if they were barred from competition and therefore couldn't get that revenue.\""}
