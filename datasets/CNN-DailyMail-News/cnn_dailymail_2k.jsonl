{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1999, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)It's the kind of thing you see in movies, like Robert Redford's role in \"All Is Lost\" or Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi.\" But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it. Miracles do happen, though, and not just in Hollywood. We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard. Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples: . Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January. He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke, Jordan said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food, Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But, Jordan said, \"It took so long. It moved so slowly.\" His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship, the Houston Express, spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. \"I thought I lost you.\" Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo, a port on Mexico's Pacific coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands. Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific . What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in, Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova, according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that. Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll, about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro. The atoll has one phone line, no Internet service and a few residents, two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive. \"I thought, 'I am going to get out,\" he said. \"Get out, get out, get out.\" Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in Hawaii, there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is: Ron Ingraham isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son, Zakary, told CNN. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . After bad weather hit, Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went \"backwards all night long.\" At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1, Zakary Ingraham responded, \"I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it.\" He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call, Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu \"weak, hungry and dehydrated\" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat, Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to Vasquez's mother. Mother calls Panama teen's return 'a miracle' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with Ecuadorian Rear. Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea \"because they had become badly decomposed.\" Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands. The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed \"severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition,\" according to Calle. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. \"For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family,\" his mother said by phone, \"to be more understanding and loving.\" Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end. For proof, look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa. 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . He was at home on March 11, 2011, when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. A devastating tsunami followed, its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors. By the time it had run the course, nearly 16,000 people were dead. It's a miracle Shinkawa wasn't one of them. Shortly after the quake, he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma. His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge, powerful tsunami wave. \"I was saved by holding onto the roof,\" the 60-year-old said, according to Kyodo News Agency. \"But my wife was swept away.' More than two days later, video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) out to sea. He was waving a self-made red flag. After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat, he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. Shinkawa told his rescuers, \"I thought today was the last day of my life.\""}

Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from \"substantially burdening\" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are \"exceedingly rare,\" and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. \"There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers,\" wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon: . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected,\" Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means \"the union of the plants,\" cited that federal law in suing the federal government. \"The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca,\" the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. \"The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA,\" the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely \"retaliation against the kosher inmates\" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited \"the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida.\" Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a \"dangerous weapon\" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as \"a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings,\" they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. \"The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000,\" Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. \"Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing,\" he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid \"the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA,\" according to a League of California Cities report in 2002. CNN's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report."}

A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1973, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "Boston (CNN)Adrianne Haslet-Davis and her husband, Adam Davis, were standing near the finish line on the day of the Boston Marathon bombing. Her feet were sore from wearing 4.5-inch heels. Still, they walked to Boylston Street to watch the runners. \"We were so in love and happy together,\" she told a federal jury Wednesday. It was the second day the Boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named Tsarnaev exploded near the finish line. The jury must decide whether bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. Haslet-Davis and Davis, who had just returned from a tour in Afghanistan with the Air Force, were steps away from the explosion near the Forum restaurant. She recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that April day in 2013. She knew right away it was a terrorist attack. Screams and heavy smoke filled the air. She couldn't hear her own screams. She thought she was dead. When her husband, who also was injured, lifted her leg, he too let out a scream. She said she thought he was in shock. She rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass, shredding her arms. She dragged herself to the Forum. \"I saw all five of my toes, but I saw a lot of blood,\" she said. \"I didn't see my ankle.\" A ballroom dancer, Haslet-Davis' left leg would later be amputated below the knee. Inside the Forum, Haslet-Davis begged for whiskey. \"I just wanted the pain to go away. I only begged for the whiskey when I thought I was going to die.\" When someone removed Adam's shoe, an artery was spurting blood. His face got whiter and whiter, she said. His eye rolled back. She thought he was dead. At a hospital, she called her parents on her cellphone. She told them she was in a terrorist attack. \"I don't think I have a left foot anymore,\" she told her father. \"I'm in really bad shape and I really need to talk to you because this might be it.\" Her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over. \"I don't care if it's illegal. I need to talk to you because these might be our last words. I said I was in a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon and Adam is dead and this might be it for me.\" Haslet-Davis told the jury that, at the Forum, her husband kept telling her he was sorry. \"That was all he could say. That he loved me. He was so sorry.\" Her husband, she said, has since \"bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the VA hospital.\" After her testimony, Haslet-Davis walked slowly off the stand. She appeared to glare at Tsarnaev, who did not look at her. Earlier this week, prosecutors showed jurors an image of Tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell. It was dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a gesture that Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said showed a young man who was \"unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\" On Wednesday, Tsarnaev's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, sought to discredit the use of the image. She suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context. On cross-examination of a deputy U.S. marshal, Conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken. In it, Tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair. Moments before, he has two fingers up, forming what Conrad called a \"V sign,\" before raising his middle finger. Gary Olivera, a deputy U.S. Marshal for 14 years, admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and Tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror. \"A lot of times people do that to get our attention,\" Olivera said. Also Wednesday, Jinyan Zhao told the jury about her niece, Lingzi Lu, a \"beautiful nerd\" and graduate student at Boston University who was killed in the bombing. Lingzi Lu was originally from China but was buried in Boston. \"How she died, and why she died, it just felt like she is part of Boston, part of city,\" her aunt said. \"The thinking is she should just be here.\" The family, Zhao said, put a music box and some books in her casket. Her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand. Later, her mother described her beautiful hand. Zhao recalled what Lu's mother said to her: \" 'No matter what I don't want to believe it is her hand.' \" The brother and stepfather of Sean Collier also took the stand Wednesday. Collier was the MIT police officer who was shot in his patrol car, another victim of the Tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture. Sean Collier always wanted to be a cop, said his brother. He was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong. Either you did it or you didn't. \"We thought it was typical little boy stuff, but he never grew out of it,\" Andrew Collier told the jury. \"Sean was always the one to spill the beans,\" said Joe Rodgers, 59, who married Collier's mother, Kelly, in 1993. \"He was a cop from an early age.\" On a Thursday night in April 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head. His car door was open, and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals. The officer who found Collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple, neck and head. He was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him. Collier would become the fourth victim of the Tsarnaev brothers. The night still feels like a dream for Rodgers. \"He had a hole in the middle of his head,\" Rodgers said. \"He was shot to pieces. He was just laying there. My wife was touching him, and his blood was coming up in her hands.\" Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S. Prosecutors said the brothers killed Collier because they wanted his gun. But their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an \"officer down\" at MIT. Less than two weeks after Tsarneav was found guilty on every count, the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds. Earlier, MIT Police Chief John DiFava told the jury that he hired Collier, who fit in \"perfectly\" because of his policing style and engaging personality. The MIT police, who are designated as special officers by the Massachusetts State Police, patrol the sprawling campus in Cambridge. \"The atmosphere of the department changed since April 18, 2013,\" he said. \"There is sadness and a sense of loss. I think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains. It was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community, but Sean's death hangs like a weight.\" DiFava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force. \"Policing is the only thing I've done in my life, and I've always tried to be good at what I do,\" he said. \"I lost one of my own. I have children at home and I've always thought I would have been very, very proud for them to wear the uniform. Now I'm not so sure.\" Rodgers said it took his wife, Kelly, months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son. Saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing. She cried all weekend. \"She was very strong,\" he said. \"She was a happy person. She was a good mother. Since Sean's death, she's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children.\" Kelly became pregnant with Sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two, Rodgers said.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1956, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown."}

Humans never have lived on a planet that's 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark. \"This is gambling with the planet,\" said Gernot Wagner, the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book \"Climate Shock.\" Think super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions. Yet for all of its importance, I don't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. I've heard it referred to as the \"north star\" for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world's attention. It's so significant that it's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year. I'm calling that effort \"2 degrees,\" and I need your help to make it work. Until 5 p.m. ET Monday, you can vote on the first story I'll report for the series. Vote using the Facebook poll below (or go here if you don't see it.) Tell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees . All of those story ideas came from you, by the way. They focus on what a 2-degree world might look like. CNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically. I don't have all the answers right now. We'll continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below you'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own. If you'd like to follow this project as it evolves, I'd encourage you to sign up for the \"2 degrees\" newsletter. And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They'll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number. One guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale. Nordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled \"Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem.\" The estimate was \"crude, but it was a reasonable first start,\" he told me. \"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years,\" he wrote in \"The Climate Casino.\" A growing body of research now supports the idea. Science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want. \"You need a judgment call for these things,\" said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. \"And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy.\" Germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission, the G8, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord, which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much. The United States was among the signatories. I'm going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council,  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank. • Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size. • Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.• A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at \"increasingly high risk of extinction\" at or near the 2-degree mark.• The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.• Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.• The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. So ... not good. And numbers don't convey the emotional toll. \"I'm from New Mexico,\" said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. \"I love it there, and I know it's going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won't be as good. The hiking won't be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It's one of my things I love most. And that's obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it's in peril. That's just for starters.\" No one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory. Plus, everyone hates a fraction. Targeting 1 degree of warming is \"ridiculous because you can't do it,\" said Nordhaus, the economist. \"Three sounds too high. And you can't have a fraction because it's too complicated. \"So two is kind of an obvious number.\" The climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution. And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we're already putting into the atmosphere, even with \"very ambitious mitigation action\" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is \"locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system,\" that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt. Yes, but it won't be easy. \"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree,\" said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum. Here's the best guess for what that \"amazing speed\" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. \"It depends on how much risk you want to accept,\" she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York, want to accept less risk than that. \"Our position is 100% clean energy,\" said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz. If we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate, we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury. Scarier still, we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100. Some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it's too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that \"north star\" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem. If you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse. The IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by \"major extinctions around the globe\" and a \"reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide.\" Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we're looking a \"catastro-f***\" that would be almost \"infinitely costly,\" said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. \"It's akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet.\" This much should be clear: Something has to change. If we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that's still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal. Please be in touch! I need your help to make this work. Email questions to: climate (at) cnn (dot) com.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1947, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. \"That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,\" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. \"I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,\" attorney Mary Koch said this week, \"I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents \"an inflection point,\" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a \"continuation in a process toward justice.\" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a \"duty to protect the justice process.\" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to \"seek justice for optics\" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: \"Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end.\" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. \"We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,\" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI \"will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks.\" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess \"policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens.\" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. \"Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,\" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. \"We welcome outside review,\" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. \"We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened.\" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he \"fled unprovoked.\" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. \"We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,\" he said. \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a \"rough ride\" or \"nickel ride,\" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is \"potential\" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. \"That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,\" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again \"to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. \"It's complex,\" Davis said of the probe. \"It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1825, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)I was a copygirl in my fourth month at the Chicago Daily News, my second assigned to the city desk.  It had become my custom at 4 o'clock, when the city desk secretary left for the day, to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day. It was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago, on Thursday, April 12, 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks.  The second city editor, Guy Housley, was to my left.  To my right, perhaps 6 feet away, the telegraph editor, George Dodge. At 4:50, the old-fashioned upright \"candlestick\" telephone on his desk rang -- the direct line The Associated Press used to alert editors to major news events.  He answered, replaced the bell-like receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular, \"Roosevelt is dead.\" The silence of shock. Until Dodge jumped up so quickly, his swivel chair crashed into the glass-fronted bookcase behind him -- a symphonic orchestra cymbals sound -- and ran to what was called the Tube Room, with its row of Associated Press Teletype machines. Housley said, \"Clear the decks for action.\" The words had barely cleared his lips when City Editor Clem Lane half-ran back into the city room.  Hal O'Flaherty, director of the Daily News Foreign Service, was only a step or two behind.  The door of the managing editor's office that opened into the city room flew open, and Managing Editor Everett Norlander joined them around the copy desk, where Dodge was editing the bulletin. Lane wheeled toward the rewrite desk.  \"Cleveland!  Get downstairs.  Get the reaction.\" The main entrance to the Chicago Daily News building also served as the main entrance to the Northwestern Railroad terminal, with its commuter trains to the North Shore communities.  A veritable sea of lemmings would be coming up that marble incline for the next hour.  Not that Charlie Cleveland could linger. The Daily News, an afternoon newspaper, was strictly limited in the hours it could publish.  Only an hour or so remained for EXTRAs. I knew clips would be needed and ran to the library, the old \"morgue.\"  They'd heard and had a splay of white envelopes on President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- big and bulging -- spread out.  They had one, as I recall -- a small one -- on Harry S. Truman.  I grabbed it and ran back down the corridor. Bob Lewin, who usually handled labor stories, had been told \"to do something on the new president.\"  He opened the Truman envelope, spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the \"books\" in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen: five sheets of copy paper stapled together, with four sheets of carbon paper between.  To be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies: the top one for the editor, a carbon copy for the reporter's reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks . Lewin's eyes moved over the clippings, evaluating, rejecting, selecting, deciding what to use.  At last, he started typing.  Because of the time pressure, the story would be done in \"short takes\": two, maybe three paragraphs at a time. He wrote: . \"The new President -- the 33d in the history of the United States -- is Harry S. Truman. \"He was automatically elevated to the presidency on the death of President Roosevelt. \"Truman will be 61 on May 8.\" Lewin ripped the book out of the typewriter roller.  I left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to Lane. Back by Lewin, I read over his shoulder: . \"Born in Lamar, Mo., Truman's political rise was spectacular. \"He was relatively little known outside of his home state when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1934.  He had the backing of the late Tom \"Boss\" Prendergast, of the Kansas City machine. This time, Lewin gave me a nod.  I pulled out the book, the typewriter roller ratcheting protest. After two more takes, Lane said, \"Okay, that's it.\" Cleveland was back.  The cricket-like click click click of typewriter keys at the rewrite desk drew me, and I stood by to take his story to Lane: . \"Word of President Roosevelt's death struck Chicago late this afternoon with numbing suddenness. \"Within a few minutes after the bulletins came to The Daily News, the office switchboards were swamped with calls for verification. \"So great were the number of calls, that the lines became clogged and many queries could not be handled. \"Many of the callers spoke as if disbelieving the report -- as if it were some wildly spread rumor. \"The same kind of uncertainty was noticed in the faces of the crowds thronging homeward.   Word passed from one to another: . \"'Did you hear that?  Roosevelt is dead?  Is it true'?\" Cleveland's story delivered, I returned to the city desk to help with the calls.  Many, as he had mentioned, from people wanting to know whether it was true but some from reporters and beat men who'd been heading home, reporting the reaction where they were. A copyboy rushed around the room, dropping off copies of the first EXTRA -- the simple news in a 76-point-type headline: ROOSEVELT DEAD . Statements began coming in from local officials and civic leaders, a few phoned in but most from the City News Bureau, which served the Chicago newspapers with local news as the wire services did with national news.  I sorted through the multiple copies, separating them into ever-growing stacks. The second EXTRA was dropped off.  ROOSEVELT DEAD   With the subhead: Dies at 63 of Hemorrhage in Georgia . The last EXTRA had a three-column photo of Roosevelt, edged in black, a two-column of Truman and a story on the president's death and funeral plans. As the editors talked, I heard one ask, \"What kind of president do you think he'll make?\"  And O'Flaherty, director of the Daily News Foreign Service, said, \"If there's anything to the American system, the man will rise to the office.\" I've thought of that through the years as Truman has risen in the opinion of presidential historians.  The atom bomb.  The Marshall Plan.  The Berlin Airlift.  The Truman Doctrine.  Recognition of the state of Israel.  Desegregation of the armed services.  Ordering U.S. forces to oppose the invading forces when North Korea crossed the 38th Parallel and invaded South Korea, then organizing a United Nations army.  Firing Douglas MacArthur. I continued to sort the statements from officials.  Lane asked me to take one set down to Lloyd Lewis. The chief editorial writer had a corner office at the far end of the long office corridor.  I found him sitting in the dark, looking out the window at the Chicago skyline.  Sensing my presence, he said, \"I wonder what the world will be like without him.\" \"I don't know, sir.\"  In the dusk, the quiet, I suspect he didn't expect an answer, but I thought about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served in the White House for an unprecedented 12 years.  \"He's the only president I can remember.\" He turned, saw me in the doorway, a teenager in penny loafers, a cardigan sweater and a pleated plaid skirt, and said with a nod, \"Of course.\" I gave him the statements and updated him on the latest news.  \"The funeral train will bring his body up from Georgia ... to Washington, I mean.\" The next morning, I turned to the editorial page to see what he'd written. Lewis took his cue from Roosevelt's address to a joint session of the Congress following his trip to Yalta.  The headline: . \"It has been a long journey.  I trust you will agree it has been a fruitful one.\" Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted FDR's age in the Chicago Daily News subhead. He was 63."}

The defense and prosecution made closing arguments in the case on Monday. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahideen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted each other in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of 8-year-old bomb victim Martin Richard, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahideen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev, 21 years old, stands accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began on March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The prosecution on Monday played a graphic video of the scene of the bombing that showed a chaotic, bloody scene with injured people everywhere. A child's piercing cries are heard. It's the son of Rebekah Gregory, who lost her leg. Then, another photo is displayed. This time jurors see Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of little Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Bill Richard, Martin's father, who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"It was Tamerlan,\" defense attorney Clarke repeated during her closing argument Monday. \"In the past few weeks we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" she said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" But he was only following his brother, she insisted. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. The older brother, a 26-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has said. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-yeaer-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims: . Richard's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open and she bled out.\" Krystle Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officier for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto,\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan. Boston Marathon Terror Attack Fast Facts ."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1900, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)After a weekend shipwreck off the coast of Italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants, the International Organization for Migrants said Monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters. Authorities still don't know the fate of many of the passengers, including children, who were on the large ship bound from Libya to Europe that capsized Saturday night in the frigid waters of the Mediterranean Sea. That sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages. \"Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint,\" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. \"They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else.\" A rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from Libya, and the number of potential victims is not clear. A Bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board. Previous estimates put the number around 700. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, said around 50 people had been saved. But the Italian Coast Guard said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. On Monday, European Union ministers met in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" Federica Mogherini told CNN's \"The World Right Now with Hala Gorani.\" The EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" Migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days, along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route. Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean, far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said last week. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 35,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea -- 23,500 have landed in Italy and more than 12,000 in Greece, according to the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. While those numbers sound high, they were even higher the previous year. In 2014, approximately 219,000 refugees and migrants sailed across the Mediterranean, with most having to be rescued by the Italian Navy, Coast Guard or merchant ships, the UNCHR said. It is estimated that 3,500 people in 2014 died at sea. On Monday, yet another boat sank off the Greek island of Rhodes, killing at least three people, the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said. Of the 83 people reported on board, at least 57 survived. Those confirmed dead were a man, a woman and a child. The capsizing of the ship that departed from Libya marked the worst such disaster so far. As rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call Saturday night, authorities say, migrants moved to one side, hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya, sending many passengers plunging into the sea. According to one Bangladeshi survivor, large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank. Smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel, the survivor told Italian authorities. \"Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive,\" Muscat said. While the shipwreck was an accident, Muscat slammed the human traffickers whom he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters. It's \"genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really,\" Muscat told CNN. \"A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible,\" said Loris De Filippi, the president of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders. He compared the high number of deaths to \"figures from a war zone.\" De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. \"Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea,\" he said. \"This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped.\" Save the Children similarly called on European officials to do more. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" the group's CEO Justin Forsyth said in a statement. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss. Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean come from sub-Saharan Africa, often traveling for weeks or months just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the ruthless smugglers who organize the voyages. \"There is a well-oiled machine with the human traffickers, first by land and then by sea, and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to Europe at all costs,\" said Rome-based journalist Barbie Nadeau. The situation on board the boat that sank over the weekend isn't unusual, based on accounts of previous voyages. On old fishing boats, \"people are crammed into what used to be the frozen live tank compartments in the bottom of the ship,\" Nadeau said. \"Those are the cheaper tickets. People that want to be out on the upper deck, which is the prime space, pay a little more for that service.\" Traffickers are believed to charge anywhere from 6,000 euros to 8,000 euros ($6,450 to $8,600) per person for the dangerous voyage, she said. Italy's proximity to the North African coast puts it on the front line of tackling the continent's migration crisis. \"We're swamped,\" Sandro Gozi, the Italian minister for European affairs, told French daily Le Monde. \"There's not even enough space in Sicily's cemeteries to bury the dead.\" An Italian search and rescue program, Mare Nostrum, was credited with rescuing more than 160,000 migrants in the space of a year. But it ended in October because of budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean. The European Union's border control agency, Frontex, started its own mission in November, known as Triton, with a budget of less than a third of that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend it ships. As anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent, European nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep. \"We can't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one doesn't happen,\" Gozi told Le Monde, lamenting \"a total absence\" of European Union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in Europe. The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, said Sunday it was consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy to be adopted in mid-May. \"These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act,\" it said. But international groups say European governments are failing to do enough. Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, De Filippi said, because \"as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Hada Messia, Josh Levs and Catherine E.

How could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested? And what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital? Gray wavered in and out of a coma and died Sunday, one week after his arrest. It's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury. But Gray is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody. Here are several other cases: . Date of arrest: March 31, 2015 . Date of death: March 31, 2015 . What happened: . Police in Vineland, New Jersey, responded to a call of a disorderly person, and White was arrested and handcuffed. Police dispatch recordings include an officer saying White \"tried to grab my gun.\" One witness, Agustin Ayala, told the Vineland Daily Journal that White was resisting arrest. But two others told WCAU that police attacked White while he was already handcuffed. \"They punched him, stomped him, kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car,\" Ricardo Garcia told the station. \"The dog bit him on his face and around his body. There's no call for that. Once a man is handcuffed and unconscious, you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station.\" Witness Luis Martinez gave a similar account. \"The other cop let the dog out, and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time,\" Martinez told WCAU. \"He was on the floor, like he was knocked out.\" As White was taken to a hospital, he became unresponsive, NJ.com reported. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. The aftermath: . The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office has been investigating White's death, and officials have been waiting for the results of White's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death, NJ.com said. Two Vineland officers have been placed on administrative leave. And after Vineland police received criticism on its Facebook page about White's case, the department started hiding unfavorable comments, the Press of Atlantic City reported. An activist filed an Open Public Records Act request, saying the department's official Facebook page was a matter of public record. Vineland police later restored the critical comments on its page. Date of arrest: March 2, 2014 . Date of death: March 2, 2014 . What happened: . Sheriff's deputies in New Iberia, Louisiana, claimed White shot and killed himself in the back of a squad car -- even though White had been frisked and handcuffed. \"Short of him being Houdini or David Copperfield, it's not possible,\" White family attorney Carol Powell-Lexing said. The incident began when authorities were responding to a fight in a gas station parking lot. About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy saw White and stopped him, state police said. According to the service report from the Sheriff's Office, Cpl. Justin Ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight. He was told only that they were black, \"and one of the males mentioned having a gun,\" the report said. White consented to a pat-down, and Ortis found marijuana in his pocket. Attorney Benjamin Crump said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious. \"If you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana, wouldn't you feel a gun?\" he said. State police said once White arrived at the police station, he refused to get out of the patrol car. \"As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round, striking himself in the back,\" state police said. White was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The aftermath: . An autopsy concluded White's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest, not in the back, like police had said. The autopsy report also said White was \"reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over.\" State police have handed over their investigation to prosecutors, who said a decision won't be made until a federal civil rights investigation wraps up. Date of police encounter: July 5, 2011 . Date of death: July 10, 2011 . What happened: . Officers in Fullerton, California, were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars. Video of the incident showed Thomas, who was schizophrenic, slow to cooperate. Fullerton police Officer Manuel Ramos  then tells him: \"You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up.\" Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help. \"OK, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!\" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax. Toward the end of the beating, the video shows, Thomas cries out for his father: \"Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, Dad.\" By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood. The aftermath: . The Orange County coroner ruled Thomas' death a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Thomas' mother, Cathy Thomas, received a $1 million settlement from the city of Fullerton. Officer Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli was charged of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both pleaded not guilty. In 2014, a jury acquitted both Ramos and Cicinelli. Date of arrest: September 6, 2013 . Date of death: September 7, 2013 . What happened: . Azucena was arrested after running a red light and leading Los Angeles police on a chase. Over the next half hour, Azucena repeatedly said he had asthma and couldn't breathe, the Los Angeles Times reported. Officers continued ignoring him. \"Help me, help me, help me,\" he said, according to a report by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. \"I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Help me, please.\" \"You can breathe just fine,\" one sergeant told him, according to the Times. \"You can talk, so you can breathe.\" He didn't breathe for much longer. Azucena was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station's holding cell for booking and left him face-down on the floor, the Times reported. By the time paramedics arrived, Azucena's heart had stopped. The aftermath: . A coroner concluded that asthma probably killed Azucena and that his death was an accident. Last month, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously agreed to a $1.35 million settlement for Azucena's mother, the Times said. The investigation into the officers' actions is ongoing. Date of arrest: November 19, 2013 . Date of death: November 19, 2013 . What happened: . An officer in Durham, North Carolina, was taking Huerta to the police station for a second-degree trespassing violation. The Durham Police Department said the teen died from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of the squad car. Durham police Chief Jose Lopez said gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation \"found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer (Samuel) Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands.\" But Huerta's family, like Victor White's family in Louisiana, suspect foul play by police. The aftermath: . Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Durham to decry Huerta's death. Some carried banners that read, \"Fue Matado Por La Policia\" or \"Murdered By Police.\" A vigil for Huerta turned violent, with six people arrested. The police chief said that as a Hispanic, he had trouble believing the allegations among the Hispanic community that Durham police unfairly target Latinos. CNN's Eliott C.

But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1965, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)The arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality. But it's unclear how Gray, who was arrested on a weapons charge April 12, suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later. Here are the big questions surrounding this controversial case: . What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore known for drugs. He \"gave up without the use of force,\"  Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said last week. An officer apparently took his Taser out and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it, Rodriguez said. And none of the six officers involved in the arrest described using force against the 25-year-old. Gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk, said Rodriguez, who described Gray as upset. \"And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,\" according to Rodriguez. Police have said Gray was not buckled in with a seat belt during the ride to a booking center. What we don't know: It's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest, and it's also unknown what, if anything, happened inside the van. What we know: Segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after Gray has been arrested and show officers dragging Gray, who is handcuffed, to a van. He can be heard screaming. \"He was dragged a bit,\" said Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, \"but then you see him using his legs to get into the van, so he was able-bodied when he was in the van. And we know that when he was finally taken out of the van, he was unresponsive.\" One woman who recorded a video of the arrest said she knew Gray. \"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" the woman said. \"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said 'I can't breathe' and just was yelling.\" Surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking, police said. That was at 8:54 a.m. At 9:24 a.m., police called an ambulance for Gray. Police say Gray requested medical attention, including an inhaler, and an ambulance later took him to the University of Maryland Medical Center's Shock Trauma Center. Rawlings-Blake and  Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis have said the arresting officers should have asked for medical attention immediately after Gray asked for it. What we don't know: It's unknown why Gray screamed, and the cell phone video doesn't capture the entire incident, start to end. And it's unclear why police didn't call for an ambulance sooner. What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers were suspended. Their names were released last week. The suspensions are standard procedure after an \"in-custody death,\" said Baltimore Police Department spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk. It doesn't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved, he said. They are: Lt. Brian Rice, 41, who joined the department in 1997; Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 1999; Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Garrett Miller, 26, who joined in 2012; and Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012. Three of the six responding officers were on bicycles when they initially approached Gray, according to Kowalczyk. Another officer joined the arrest after it was initiated, while one more drove the police van, the police spokesman said. What we don't know: The officers say they didn't use force against Gray, but that's not certain. In fact, details about what each of the officers specifically did have not been released. What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields. In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver. Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved. Gray was paroled on June 30, 2011. On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison, Shields said, reasoning that  whatever Gray allegedly did, it \"was something minor.\" Gray did return to prison in May 2013 for drug possession, serving a month behind bars before his release in June. What we don't know: It's not known whether Gray's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest, or his death. What we know: Protesters have taken to the streets of Baltimore daily since two days after Gray's death, rallying around his family.  On the first night, they marched to a local police station chanting \"No justice! No peace!\" On another occasion they marched to City Hall. The demonstrations have been peaceful on most nights, but on Monday rioters damaged buildings and destroyed police vehicles. Looters stole goods from several stores. Some groups of people intervened, keeping additional looters out of trashed businesses. The demonstrators are pushing to get answers about Gray's death and for \"justice,\" as they define it. Similar protests were held in Ferguson, Missouri, following Michael Brown's death and in New York, after the death of Eric Garner. Other small protests have sprung up in other cities in the past week. \"Mr. Gray's family deserves justice,\" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week. \"And our community deserves an opportunity to heal, to get better, and to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again. The mayor said that any confirmed information will be promptly relayed to the public. \"I want people to understand that I have no interest in hiding information, holding back information,\" Rawlings-Blake said. Some protesters have called for the officers to be arrested and charged. One organizer called for Police Commissioner Anthony Batts to resign. What we don't know: There's no guarantee protesters will get the kind of definitive answers they want about how and why Gray died. What we know: Baltimore police are looking into Gray's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by Friday. The probe, like the suspensions of the six police officers, is standard whenever someone dies while in custody. The police's findings will go to the state's attorney's office, where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed. Batts said recently that a medical examiner had some initial findings, but needed to get back the results of toxicology reports, which could take weeks. Rawlings-Blake asked for an outside investigation, given the city's dark history of police misconduct. The U.S. Justice Department, which announced a collaborative reform initiative with Baltimore police in October in light of its past problems, is looking into the Gray case, a spokesman said last week. The point of that federal investigation will be to gauge whether a prosecutable civil rights violation may have occurred. What we don't know: What information that investigators, both local and federal, will turn up and when. It is also unclear if the medical examiner called in spinal experts to view the evidence, a possibility Batts raised at a news conference. What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. The Gray family attorney called the allegation a \"sideshow.\" Gray was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" attorney William Murphy told CNN. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said. The court documents also say that Gray \"fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" \"The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,\" the documents say. \"The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring-assisted, one-hand-operated knife.\" Maryland law makes it illegal to \"wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind\" -- including switchblades -- \"concealed on or about the person.\" What we don't know: It's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime, said Rawlings-Blake. \"It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,\" she said. CNN's  AnneClaire Stapleton, Stephanie Gallman, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Dana Ford and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report."}

Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. \"This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,\" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" the officer writes that Slager said. \"He took my Taser.\" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,\" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. \"I ... thought about erasing the video,\" Santana told MSNBC's \"All in With Chris Hayes\" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. \"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger.\" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events . Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,\" he told Holt. \"But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston . The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father,\" she said. \"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son.\" Who was Walter Scott?

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1847, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Jon Reiter is no stranger to Mount Everest -- its world-record height, its prestige, its challenges. And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. \"It's been a really rough day,\" Susan Reiter told CNN. \"Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive.\" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. \"Huge disaster,\" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. \"Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.\" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that \"a huge avalanche swept over basecamp\" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. \"On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,\" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. \"This also makes it more difficult to search for people.\" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. \"The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,\" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. \"Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal.\" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an \"adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer.\" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. \"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,\" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,\" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, \"whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation.\" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. \"On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,\" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, \"which is very dangerous anyway,\" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, \"the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves.\" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. \"It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,\" he said. \"I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. \"It's been a bad few years on Everest,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength.\" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, \"Into Thin Air.\" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. \"This is our job,\" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost \"friends in brothers\" in the 2014 avalanche. \"So there is always a risk of death.\" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of \"The Seven Summits\" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 \"because it didn't feel right\" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? \"You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,\" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. \"But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back.\" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors . CNN's Katia Hetter, Jessica King and Carma Hassan contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1903, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. \"I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,\" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the \"golden boy,\" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. \"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,\" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, \"I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting.\" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. \"If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,\" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. \"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,\" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with \"Nfl.\" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became \"angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize.\" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, \"Yo, what's up now,\" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1951, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Late one night on Facebook, a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis, and both their lives were changed forever. The girl, Katie Donovan, read that the boy, Dalton Prager, was very sick.  \"If you ever need a friend to talk to, you can reach out to me,\" she wrote. \"Sorry, but do I know you?\" he responded. No, you don't, Katie wrote back, and told Dalton a bit about herself. Like him, she was 18, and \"my breathing is pretty crappy and I see you are in the hospital. I'm sorry. I know it sucks!...But you just gotta stay strong.\" Messages between the two flew back and forth. They realized they were falling in love. For most other couples, the next step would be to meet in person. But for Katie and Dalton, that was complicated -- and dangerous. Cystic fibrosis patients shouldn't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs. Dr. Michael Anstead at the University of Kentucky, Katie's pulmonologist since she was a little girl, had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other CF patients were a bad idea. In their online conversations, one of the first things Dalton told Katie about himself was that he had Burkholderia cepacia, a horribly dangerous infection for people with CF. \"I was like, 'Hi, I'm Dalton from Missouri and I have Burkholderia cepacia,' because it's such a big deal in the CF community,\" he remembers. \"I left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her.\" Katie listened to her heart, even if it might hurt her lungs. She asked Dalton to come visit her in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. \"I told Dalton I'd rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years,\" Katie says. \"That was definitely something I had to think about, but when you have those feelings, you just know.\" So on August 28, 2009, Dalton drove more than six hours from St. Charles, Missouri, to Katie's hometown in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where they'd arranged to meet at the Dairy Queen. At 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- Katie got out of her car and saw Dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses. \"My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello,\" she remembers. \"I'm usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right.\" Katie took Dalton and his mother, Renee, who'd made the trip with him, to have dinner with her and her parents, Debbie and John Donovan. Later the young couple drove around Flemingsburg, and Dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday, which was two days before. Their health quickly deteriorated, and within months, the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time. Too ill to work, Dalton quit his job at his family's auto repair shop, and Katie quit hers as a store clerk. In August, 2014, the couple entered the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center together to wait for new lungs. Dalton's came first, and on November 17, he had his transplant. Despite his Burkholderia cepacia, which makes transplants more complicated, it was a success. \"I was so thrilled. I was so happy for him,\" Katie says. The month after Dalton's surgery, UPMC discharged Katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while. When she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital, but  UPMC informed her she'd used up her supply of Medicare days and wouldn't accept her. Medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- wouldn't pay for another hospitalization until Katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days. But Katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days, much less sixty. So Katie relied on Medicaid, public insurance that was supplied by her home state of Kentucky. She was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, where she was cared for by Anstead, her beloved pulmonologist. But then, another hurdle. Anstead explained that most lung transplant centers, including the two in Kentucky, don't do transplants on patients with Burkholderia cepacia, referring them to larger centers like UPMC that have more experience with such complicated cases. Katie and Dalton, now 24 and 23, were desperate. Her doctors predicted she wouldn't live a year without new lungs. Going on her husband's private insurance wasn't an option, since Dalton is on his father's policy. In February, Anstead wrote a letter to Medicaid, pleading with them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care at UPMC, even though it was out of state. Kentucky Medicaid denied his plea, and that's when the squabbling began. In a statement to CNN, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services pointed the finger at UPMC, saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. \"Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,\" wrote the spokeswoman, Gwenda Bond. \"Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.\" UPMC counters that Kentucky Medicaid told them that if they want to care for Katie, they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. While UPMC spokeswoman Wendy Zellner didn't elaborate, a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state Medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low. Asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid is \"an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state Medicaid programs,\" Zellner wrote. \"UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation.\" Today, Katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed, hoping that the three parties -- Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs. \"I feel like they're putting a dollar sign on my life,\" she says. \"I don't want to die because of money. That's stupid. Nobody should have to do that.\" If Katie doesn't get her transplant, not only will she die, but she'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection, which could be deadly for him as he's on drugs to suppress his immune system. As a result of inquiries from CNN, on Wednesday Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services arranged for a caseworker to call Katie at the hospital. But it didn't go very well. Katie says the caller, who identified herself as Pat Pierorazio, was \"rude, mean, and angry.\" \"She said someone had told her to call me, and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me,\" she says. Katie says the Medicare representative told her she would look into her situation. In a statement, Albright with CMS wrote to CNN: \"We are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs. CMS is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible.\" Caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance, Katie tries to stay strong, just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first Facebook conversation. Skyping with Dalton helps, and raising money on their Facebook page keeps her mind busy. And she's always thinking about their \"after transplant bucket list,\" which they keep in a safe in their house so it won't be destroyed by fire or flood. On the list: Drive through every state. Learn another language and visit a country where they speak it. Write a book together about their love story. They have simpler dreams as well. Like going grocery shopping together, or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television. And this is their biggest goal: . \"I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug. That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary,\" she says. Wednesday afternoon, there were signs of hope. Zeller, the UPMC spokeswoman, sent an email to CNN. \"Ky Medicaid has reached out to us to talk. So stay tuned,\" she wrote. Katie and Dalton were glad to hear it. \"I don't care what I have to do to get her lungs,\" Dalton said. \"I will just keep trying until there's nothing left to try.\""}

The video is being dissected frame by frame by authorities and media outlets, all in an effort to reconstruct what exactly happened between North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager, a five-year employee of that force, and Walter Scott, 50. Slager, 33, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder after firing eight shots at Scott, killing him. Slager is also now \"terminated\" from the force, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said Wednesday. Added police Chief Eddie Driggers on Wednesday: \"I watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw and I have not watched it since.\" Both Scott and Slager had once served in the U.S. Coast Guard, with Scott's service occurring 1984-86 and Slager's 2003-09. Scott was a father of four. Slager is a father to two stepchildren, and his wife is eight months' pregnant. Here's what we know of the fatal shooting: . Slager pulled Scott over at 9:33 a.m. Saturday for a broken taillight, according to authorities. Chief Driggers described the incident as \"traffic stop of an individual who had a minor infraction on his vehicle, a brake light being out.\" A foot chase then occurred, a police report said. The video, taken by a passer-by, doesn't show any vehicle. Rather, Slager and Scott are on a path or roadway in a parklike setting bordered partly by a chain-link fence. The video was shot over and through the fence. \"The officer said that Walter ran from the vehicle during the traffic stop,\" Scott family attorney L. Chris Stewart said. According to the police report, Scott did not comply with the officer's demands. Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, said his brother had trouble with child support and had an outstanding warrant against him, but that his sibling wasn't prone to violence. \"That very well could have been the reason (for running from police), not to be arrested for the warrant that was on him for child support,\" Anthony Scott said. The video begins by showing a second or two of an apparent struggle between the officer and suspect. The officer contended he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take that weapon, authorities said. But when Anthony Scott saw the video, he was convinced the officer lied, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" The video shows Walter Scott running away, with his back to the officer. As he does so, two objects fall. One falls behind the officer. And the other falls between the two men. To Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer to escape more of the Taser. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot. No one would have thought that,\" Scott said. As Walter Scott runs away, the officer pulls his service pistol and fires eight times, the video shows. As the shots are being fired, Scott keeps running away from the officer, the video shows. Scott then falls. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether it is the Taser. It's also unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser, or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Immediately after Scott was shot, according to the video, someone yells, \"Put your hands behind your back!\" Scott, motionless and face-down on the ground, is handcuffed. It was Slager who apparently called police dispatch. \"226 to dispatch, shots fired, subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,\" Slager told the dispatcher, according to a transcript provide by Broadcastify.com. The dispatcher notes that the subject is down at 9:38 a.m., according to the transcript. About 90 seconds after saying that Scott \"grabbed\" his Taser, the officer describes Scott as unresponsive and having wounds to the chest, right thigh and buttocks, according to the transcript. The location of the shooting is behind a pawn shop, the officer tells the dispatcher. A police report identified that shop as Mega Pawn. According to CNN affiliate WCIV-TV in Charleston, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. However, Aylor later told CNN that he was no longer representing the officer. \"Today, I withdrew my representation of Michael Slager. This is a terrible tragedy that has impacted our community,\" Aylor said in a statement. Later, Anthony Scott's mother calls him and says his brother was Tasered at a traffic stop. Anthony Scott goes to the scene and finds it curious to see police tape around his brother's vehicle and the officer's vehicle. He asks officers what happened. No one replies. Then Anthony Scott's nephew tells him that \"my brother is gone,\" Anthony Scott said. \"And at that, I lost it,\" Anthony Scott said. An officer also apprises him later of what happened. Anthony Scott is shown the video for the first time on Sunday. \"My reaction to it was that we have to get ahold of the video and that this was key evidence, key evidence in the case,\" Anthony Scott said. \"We had to get it. The country had to see this.\" He felt \"a little bit of anger and happy at the same time,\" the brother said. \"Based on what the video was showing, it was discrediting what the officer had initially stated,\" Anthony Scott said. The nation did indeed see the video -- and was stunned by its revelations. Authorities saw it, too. Slager was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, WCIV reported. \"I have two stepchildren and one on the way,\" Slager told a magistrate through video conferencing. If found guilty of murder, Slager could face up to life in prison or death. The city of North Charleston will continue to cover the insurance for the pregnancy of Slager's wife, the mayor said. An autopsy on Scott, performed Sunday, \"revealed that Mr. Scott sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and the manner of death was ruled 'Homicide,' \" Charleston County Coroner Rae H. Wooten said Wednesday. Anthony Scott said Wednesday that his brother was \"shot in the back four times.\" The autopsy findings support family's claims that the police used excessive use -- even if the video never existed, Anthony Scott said. \"Eventually we would have gotten to this point, but not this fast,\" Anthony Scott said. \"There is absolutely no way to cover that up,\" he added about the gunshot wounds to the back. North Charleston police aren't involved in the investigation into the shooting and have turned the matter over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The FBI is also investigating. Anthony Scott and family attorney Stewart believe the object that Officer Slager relocated at the crime scene is the Taser, they said. Stewart also accused the officer of trying to plant evidence by moving the Taser and placing it close to Walter Scott's body. A slow-motion analysis of the tape, along with highlights of key moments, supports the family's step-by-step interpretation of the officer's actions, including the handling of the Taser, the attorney alleged. \"He drops the Taser, kills Mr. Scott, walks all the way back, picks something up off the ground from where he was taking the shots, comes back to the body, waits a second, drops it on the ground, and then pretends to be recovering it and putting it back on his holster,\" Stewart said, referring to the Taser. \"Why we believe that is because it fits in line with his initial report of what happened out there. I mean he just committed a murder. He needed something, a justifiable reason to use lethal force, and that's the only thing he could think of,\" Stewart said. Neither Officer Slager or his attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday. Authorities aren't commenting on the details of the case while it's under investigation.

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1961, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Dan Swangard knows what death looks like. As a physician, he has seen patients die in hospitals, hooked to morphine drips and overcome with anxiety. He has watched dying drag on for weeks or months as terrified relatives stand by helplessly. Recently, however, his thoughts about how seriously ill people die have become personal. Swangard was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of metastatic cancer. To remove the cancer, surgeons took out parts of his pancreas and liver, as well as his entire spleen and gallbladder. The operation was successful but Swangard, 48, knows there's a strong chance the disease will return. And if he gets to a point where there's nothing more medicine can do, he wants to be able to control when and how his life ends. \"It's very real for me,\" said Swangard, who lives in Bolinas, Calif. \"This could be my own issue a year from now.\" That's one of the reasons Swangard joined a California lawsuit last month seeking to let doctors prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who want to hasten death. If he were given only months to live, Swangard said, he can't say for certain whether he would take them. \"But I want to be able to make that choice,\" he said. The right-to-die movement has gained renewed momentum in California and around the nation following the highly publicized death of an East Bay woman with brain cancer. Brittany Maynard, 29, moved to Oregon to take advantage of its \"Death with Dignity\" law and died in November after taking a fatal dose of barbiturates prescribed by her doctor. The California lawsuit asks the court to protect physicians from liability if they prescribe lethal medications to patients who are both terminally ill and mentally competent to decide their fate. The lawsuit argues that while it is against the law in California for anyone to assist in another's suicide, these cases are not suicides. Rather, the suit argues, they are choices by a dying person on how his or her life should end and decisions about one's own body protected under the state constitution. Separately, two California state senators have proposed a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to certain terminally ill adults. Three states -- Oregon, Washington and Vermont -- already have laws allowing physician-assisted deaths. Courts in New Mexico and Montana also have ruled that aid in dying is legal, and a suit was also recently filed in New York. Legislation is pending in several other states. Kathryn Tucker, an attorney on several of the court cases, is also spearheading the California lawsuit. This time, she and her legal team decided to include among the plaintiffs two doctors with life-threatening illnesses, Swangard and a retired San Francisco obstetrician. Physicians \"have a very deep and broad understanding about what the journey to death can be like,\" said Tucker, executive director of the Disability Rights Legal Center. \"The curtain is pulled back. For lay people, death is much more mysterious.\" Historically, doctors have been some of the most vocal critics of assisted suicide, also called aid-in-dying. The American Medical Association still says that \"physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.\" Similarly, though it hasn't taken a position on currently proposed legislation, the California Medical Association has said that helping patients die conflicts with doctors' commitment to do no harm. \"It is the physicians' job to take care of the patient and that is amplified when that patient is most sick,\" said spokeswoman Molly Weedn. But a recent survey of 21,000 doctors in the U.S. and Europe shows views may be shifting. According to Medscape, the organization that did the survey, 54 percent of American doctors support assisted suicide, up from 46 percent four years earlier. Swangard is among those who believe that taking care of patients means letting them choose how their lives should end. That's not the same as killing patients or facilitating suicide, he said. Swangard completed his medical residency in San Francisco in the middle of the AIDS crisis; young men were dying all around him. Throughout his career as an internal medicine doctor, a hospice volunteer and now an anesthesiologist, he has become frustrated with how the medical system handles death. Doctors spend so much time trying to extend life that few focus on what patients want in their last days, he said. \"I don't think we know how to die,\" he said. \"We fight tooth and nail to keep that from happening.\" Swangard's own illness was discovered in early 2013 during a long overdue check-up. He hadn't been worried about his health -- he was obsessed with fitness, swimming regularly and seeing a trainer twice a week. But when the doctor pressed on Swangard's stomach, he felt a mango-sized mass. He had a visceral feeling, he said, \"something bad was happening.\" Within a week, a surgeon found a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas and metastasis in the liver. It was the same cancer that took Steve Jobs' life -- one that doesn't generally respond to chemotherapy or radiation. \"My fears became real,\" he said. The doctors told him they believed they got all the cancerous cells. But Swangard was tormented by questions: Am I going to be alive in a year? Is my cancer going to come back? \"I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't exercising, I was marinating in my own sadness and fear of what this all meant,\" he said. \"I thought, 'This is going to kill me.'\" Since his diagnosis, Swangard said he has had a greater understanding of his patients' struggles. Occasionally, he holds their hands and tells them he has been where they are. Earlier this year, a physician friend asked him if he'd be willing to join the California case. Swangard didn't hesitate. He didn't go into medicine to help dying people linger and wants to help change that approach — for his patients and for himself. When he dies, Swangard said, he wants to be surrounded by people he loves. He doesn't want to be in a drug-induced haze, nor consumed by worry about what's next. He wants to be able to say goodbye. \"It is a little bit of a blessing to know how I might die,\" he said. \"I don't think a lot of patients have insight into what to expect.\" These days, he wears a Buddhist prayer bracelet, a reminder to focus on the present. He cut his work hours, swims as often as he can and meditates regularly. At home, he stares out at the ocean, often watching dolphins pass by. He makes every effort to stay calm and healthy. He is in remission but he knows that what happens with the cancer is largely outside his control. An MRI last year showed a small lesion in his liver, which doctors are watching closely. \"It's this big unknown,\" he said. Dr. Robert Liner, a fellow plaintiff who only recently met Swangard, lives with the same uncertainty. On his 69th birthday in May 2013, the retired obstetrician had a bad cough. He felt tired and short of breath. His wife took him to the hospital, where doctors discovered malignant masses on his kidneys — advanced-stage lymphoma. After radiation and chemotherapy, the tumors shrank. He also is in remission. But if the cancer comes back, he said, \"the prospects are not going to be good.\" He often thinks of a former patient, a 25-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer. She wanted to die while she still was able to communicate. Liner wasn't able to help ease her death because the law wouldn't let him. \"I felt like I'd failed her,\" he said. Years before his diagnosis, Liner, now 70, became involved with Compassion & Choices, an organization that promotes aid-in-dying. He has a shelf of books in his San Francisco home devoted to the subject: Being Mortal, Dying Right, Knocking on Heaven's Door. He keeps a stack of notecards with quotes about the end of life, which he often recites in speeches to church groups or senior centers. One reads, \"The best preparation for death is a life well-lived.\" He believes having medication to hasten death helps terminally ill people live fully in their last weeks or months without being immobilized by fear. \"If you are riddled with anxiety, you are not free to concentrate on what's most meaningful to you,\" he said. Like Swangard, Liner doesn't know if he would take the medication. He recently married the woman he calls his \"beloved\" and said he has lots of plans for his retirement years, including writing a screenplay and improving his piano playing. \"My wife says I'd be hanging on to life by my fingernails,\" he said. But that decision should be his to make, with his family and his doctor, he said. \"I want the comfort of knowing it's up to me when enough is enough,\" he said.

Investigators have not found any writings or conversations where Lubitz shared his motives or confessed to any plans, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. However, medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy. This was before he ever got his pilot's license, Kumpa said. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. It is believed that Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane Tuesday into the French Alps, killing all 150 on board. The prosecutor's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming Lubitz unfit to fly, though there were no physical illnesses found. In short, investigators in Germany and France are not yet ruling anything out. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. He had stated working as a commercial pilot in 2013, Lufthansa said. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. It's unknown if Lubitz mentioned his problems on a form that asks yes-or-no questions about physical and mental illness, suicide attempts and medications. European pilots must fill out the form to be recertified. Federal aviation authorities, not the airline, issue the form. The form is privileged information and Lufthansa never sees a pilot's completed form, said an airline spokesperson. The airline would only get a \"clear to fly\" notice from the aviation doctors alerting the airline that a pilot has completed recertification. Lubitz had visited an eye doctor because of vision problems, a European government official familiar with the investigation told CNN. The pilot complained he was not seeing as he should, but the doctor told him the cause was psychosomatic, the official said. In part because of this, the doctor deemed Lubitz unfit for flying. Lubitz told a different doctor --  a neuropsychologist -- that he was too stressed with work, the European official said. The dates of these visits are unclear, but they could have been earlier this year. The official said he is not aware of any suicidal tendencies reported by Lubitz to the doctors, but that investigators believe he was suicidal. Airline officials have said that if Lubitz went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. The note, which was \"slashed,\" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, Kumpa said Friday. Britain's most senior psychiatrist, Sir Simon Wessely, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that when a pilot is \"acutely depressed or suffering from really any physical illness\" that impairs abilities, they cannot fly an aircraft safely. \"We don't let pilots fly with depression ... because they're impaired in concentration, memory and attention, which isn't good for a pilot,\" said Wessely, who is president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army. One of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge from the crash so far comes from the cockpit voice recorder. The sounds recorded on the recorder, known as a \"black box,\" firms up a theory by investigators that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. \"For God's sake, open the door!\" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. CNN cannot independently verify the information, which Bild says is based on 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder. According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz told him he could go anytime. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. Once that's finished, Lubitz again told the captain he \"can go anytime.\" There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, \"You can take over.\" At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the \"sink rate,\" Bild reported. Next comes the banging. Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says, \"Terrain -- pull up!\" \"Open the damn door!\" the pilot says. It's 10:38 a.m., and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. Screams can be heard one final time. France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency was \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak to Bild. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere \"voyeurism.\" Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. About 150 German investigators -- some specializing in homicide cases and others in identifying remains -- are in the French Alps at the site of the crash, Dusseldorf police said Monday. Meanwhile, police continue to examine evidence collected from the apartment of Lubitz and from his parents' home, police said. French investigators at the crash site said they are optimistic they will be able to identify most of the passengers but added that \"it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash.\" Of the 150 passengers, 78 had been identified through DNA, Lt. Col.  Jean-Marc Menichini told CNN. Weather conditions slowed the rescue work Monday, Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie unit said. A new path under construction to the crash site will reduce the time it takes to reach the area, he said. Le Vernet Mayor Francois Balique told CNN the path was within 100 meters of being finished. He commissioned a backhoe to build the path, he said. \"I felt the family members wanted this and they asked me to get them as close as possible, as if every meter mattered to them,\" he said.

Usually it is related to how Arsenal’s defensive record is statistically actually very good (it is) in the aftermath of the latest debacle. But last week it was on the issue of quotas, or more specifically FA chairman Greg Dyke’s idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12. ‘I believe that we are in the world of competition,’ said Wenger in one of his regular interviews to beIN Sports. ‘That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best or we are not in a competition anymore. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shows his frustrations during a Premier League match in March 2011 . FA chairman Greg Dyke pictured attending the friendly between England and Italy in Turin on Tuesday . ‘So we can say one or two things – we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players. If you want to sell the Premier League for a huge amount of money then we need to say: \"Buy this, this is the best league in the world.\" You cannot go against the quality and what is at the heart of our job, which is competition.’ And on the surface there seems nothing wrong with this. As an economics graduate Wenger is a disciple of Adam Smith and these are the basic principles of a free market. Tear down barriers, let competition flourish and the best man or woman will ultimately win – or at least have a place in Wenger’s starting XI. It sounds sensible enough but of course the issue is a little more complex than Wenger implies. A cursory glance at Wenger’s transfer record shows in his bid to save the Premier League from English mediocrity he has signed Tomas Danilevicius, Igor Stepanovs, Kaba Diawara, Sebastian Squillaci, Andre Santos, Amoury Bischoff, Park Chu-Young, Marouane Chamakh, Pascal Cygan, Philippe Senderos, Denilson, Manuel Almunia and Johan Djourou. Arsenal's Andre Santos on the ball during a league match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in 2011 . Marouane Chamakh (left) attempts to control the ball during a Capital One Cup clash with Reading in 2012 . Arsenal midfielder Denilson (left) holds off Leyton Orient's Stephen Dawson at the Emirates in 2011 . There are more but that’s what a brief search elicits. You might argue that you need to sign ten Park Chu-youngs to get one Robin van Persie. And of course, over 18 years any manager, even a great one as Wenger is, can make some dud buys. He made some very good ones from abroad as well: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Cesc Fabegas... we could go on. But the list of shame does expose a flaw at the heart of his argument. Clubs always argue for fewer restrictions and they always say it is to do with excellence. The reality is it’s just as much to do with cost. There is nothing in Greg Dyke’s proposals to stop Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla playing for Arsenal. It might however make it a little trickier for the likes of Almunia, Andre Santos and Stepanovs in the future. The reason why Arsenal went for Stepanovs back in 2000 was not because it he was excellent; it was because he was cheaper than the equivalent English player; same with Almunia in 2004 and Andre Santos in 2011. Turns out they weren’t good enough either. Arsenal's Park Chu-young in action during a Carling Cup match against Shrewsbury Town in 2011 . Igor Stepanovs (left) battles with Sunderland's Kevin Phillips for the ball at Highbury in December 2000 . Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia watches a shot go wide at the Emirates Stadium in January 2011 . Now it may be that applying more quotas could be detrimental to Dyke’s vision of encouraging clubs to play English players in that it pushes their price up even more. That’s a debate worth having but the main thrust of Dyke’s proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players. For Wenger’s argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers’ pyramid which stand out and which any team would want – the Thierry Henrys, Patrick Vierias of this world. Nothing in Dyke’s rules to prevent them from signing, as they were EU nationals. You would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 – that’s 13! – foreign players in your squad of 25. But there is another tier of players below that – let’s says the Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta level (who would also still be available under they Dyke proposals as EU players). These are good players, but they are much more plentiful than the elite. In fact, given the right training and a chance in the first team, you could probably produce your own. Arsenal did once: Ray Parlour. Served Wenger quite well, too, in his double-winning and Invincible years. Ray Parlour falls to the ground after a tackle by Tottenham's Jamie Redknapp at White Hart Lane in 2004 . Wenger (left) watches on from the touchline as Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last month . But Parlour was developed before Wenger arrived and he was the beneficiary of a youth system which was thriving at the time. The Arsenal manager, since his arrival, has never shown an awful amount of interest in Arsenal’s youth set-up. He is undoubtedly a manager who supports young players – it’s just most of them are signed from abroad or Southampton rather than coming from his own academy. The fact that Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere are regular starters and were players developed at Arsenal's academy during Wenger’s 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager. Ashley Cole was his greatest find from that source but who knows what would have happened to him had Silvinho not had to leave the club suddenly when his Portuguese nationality was called into question? All Dyke is trying to do is focus clubs and their managers on trying a little bit harder to look in their own backyard before spending £2million on Pascal Cygan. Nothing he has proposed would stop Premier League clubs from signing genuine superstars. The ‘best league in the world’ (the league, incidentally, without any qualifiers in the Champions League quarter-finals under the current policy) is under no threat whatsoever. Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (left) breaks past QPR's Darnell Furlong at Loftus Road last month . Arsenal's Jack Wilshere (front) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against Brentford on Tuesday . Sadly Dyke probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs. If there is one thing guaranteed to rile the Premier League, it’s attempting to dictate terms. The only way to cajole the multi-national group of owners and executives into helping English football is by convincing them it’s in their own interests. Most are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile. But now they need an additional nudge to take the final step and actually play some of their expensively-trained academy players. Even Mauricio Pochettino, who has a great track record with English players, wouldn’t have given Harry Kane a go if Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor had been producing. But if Kane isn’t a good enough incentive for the Premier League clubs to work harder to promote players, perhaps their recent travails in the Champions League and Europa League might convince them. A majority of the best players in the world are being produced in Spain and South America; another significant proportion come from Germany. Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor gestures during the Capital One Cup semi-final in January . Tottenham star Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Leicester at White Hart Lane last month . The best of those players will naturally aspire to play for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Now that Financial Fair Play restrictions mean the wages are no bigger over here, those that come to the Premier League will be the second tier of stars that can’t make it at those clubs. If English clubs want to be the best in the world, they’re going to have to become an awful lot better at creating the best players. And if Wenger wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the Premier League’s record in Europe over the past three seasons. In fact, if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps, like Ajax, AC Milan, Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsenal might have won the Champions League by now."}

Lucy Garrod, now 27, developed an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion, caused by a bacterial infection which grew under her right lens. Miss Garrod had been wearing contact lenses since she was 15 with no problems, but woke up one day with an itchy and irritable right eye. Lucy Garrod, 27, was left partially blind in her right eye after bacteria began growing underneath her contact lens, causing an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion . Miss Garrod had worn contact lenses for 12 years with no problem, but woke up one morning feeling as though her eye was 'the size of a golf ball' Miss Garrod feared she would not be able to carry on with her photography degree due to going partially blind in one eye. But she learned to take photographs with her left eye and passed with first class honours . She said it felt like it had swollen to the size of a golf ball, and rushed to see her GP, who prescribed drops. A few days later her eye was still swollen and bloodshot so she went to hospital, where tests revealed the corneal abrasion. Doctors said the ulcer was growing on the surface of her eye, millimetres away from permanently blinding her. She spent a week in hospital, where medics broke the news that she was still partially blind. As a result, she feared she would not be able to complete the last year of her photography degree. Determined not to give up, she taught herself how to take photographs with her left eye, and passed her degree with first class honours. Fortunately, laser eye surgery was later able to restore her sight. Miss Garrod, a freelance photographer living in London, said: 'That day I'd put my lenses in late that morning, but by 4pm my eye was aching. 'It was itchy and usually if you rub it, it was okay. 'But that day I had a sharp shooting pain, the worst I'd ever experienced. 'Two hours later I took my lenses out and removed my make-up, thinking it might be irritating my eye, but there was no relief. Corneal abrasions are a small scratch on the cornea, the clear window at the front of the eye. They are generally a result of injury to the surface of the eye. Common causes include a fingernail scratching the eye, walking into something, and getting grit in the eye, particularly if the eye is then rubbed. It can also be caused by certain eye conditions, including trachoma, a bacterial infection. Injuries can also be caused by contact lens being put in and removed from the eye. Abrasions are very painful because there are many nerves that supply the cornea. The pain gets better as your eye heals, but this can take between 24 and 48 hours. If the abrasion involves the central part of your cornea, your vision could also be temporarily affected. Apart from the pain, your eye might be watery, red and sensitive to light. If your eye becomes increasingly red or painful after treatment or your sight becomes much more blurred, see an eye doctor again or contact the hospital. Source: Moorfields Eye Hospital . 'I could close my eye and thought that might take the pain away but it didn't and straining gave me a headache. 'I was awake most of the night.' The next morning Miss Garrod, who is originally from Jersey, looked in the mirror and found her eye was swollen. She said: 'It felt like size of a golf ball. 'My GP said I could have conjunctivitis but I'd had it before. 'It made my eye itchy but this felt worse, painful.' She was given eye drops, which she used for a couple of days until the pain got worse and she went to Beckenham Hospital, where she was given cream to soothe her eyes. However, just two days later her eye was so bloodshot she went back to hospital. Tests showed she had a corneal abrasion, an ulcer on her eye, caused by bacteria getting under her lens. Because her eye was so sensitive she spent a week in a dark room, a nurse coming in every half an hour, 24 hours a day, to give her eyes drops. 'The pain was under control but I was so bored,' she recalled. Next, doctors broke the news that she had lost sight in her right eye, due to the ulcer's position. She said: 'The good news was if the ulcer had been millimetres over I would have lost my sight completely. 'As it was slightly off centre, I would be left partially sighted in that eye. 'But I'd got used to that. My vision had been blurred since my eye first itched.' Miss Garrod was terrified she might not be able to complete the second and third years of her photography degree at Bournemouth University. After she was discharged from hospital she had to learn to use her left eye to take pictures. Previously she had used her right eye to do this, but she couldn't now she was partially sighted in that eye. She was told she would not be able to have laser surgery to fix it as it required cutting a flap in the lens, which was not strong enough for the procedure and would tear. Miss Garrod was forced to spend a week in hospital where nurses put drops in her eye every half an hour for 24 hours. Fortunately, years later she had laser eye surgery to restore the sight in her eye . Miss Garrod struggled with her photography course as she was partially blinded in one eye. She says her friend Bex (left) helped he take notes and assisted her on shoots . A specialist then suggested she could 'piggy back' her lenses, to improve her sight in that eye. It meant wearing a hard lens directly on her eye as a softer one would sink in to the ulcer, then putting a soft lens on top of that. Miss Garrod said: 'I'd have to get used to wearing two lenses so I said, \"I'll just wear glasses.\" For the next month Miss Garrod continued to use the drops and creams she had been given, to help her eye heal. She said: 'My eye was uncomfortable and still watering. 'I struggled with my uni course and had to teach myself how to use my left eye to take photos as my right one was blurry. 'My tutor said I should take a year out but I refused and stuck it out. 'My best friend, who was on my course, helped me take notes and assisted me with photo shoots. Without her I wouldn't have got through it. 'Then my dad found a specialist who suggested a stronger hard lens to improve my sight.' It meant Miss Garrod could complete her degree and gain a first class honours. She wore the hard lenses for the next few years. However the sight in her right eye was still limited and the lenses started to become irritating and uncomfortable. Then, she was referred to the private London Vision Clinic, and told that in fact she could have laser surgery to renew and improve her sight in both eyes. She said: 'As I'd been told before I wouldn't be able to have laser treatment, I thought they wouldn't be able to help.' But Miss Garrod had surgery on both eyes, to improve her left eye so she wouldn't have to wear glasses or lenses. Miss Garrod wore glasses as a young girl (pictured) but had worn contact lenses ever since she was 15 with no problems, until she developed the corneal abrasion that left her partially blind . Next, ultrasound was used to guide a laser to remove the scarred area of her right eye, while preserving the clear tissue underneath, restoring her sight in that eye. She said: 'The surgery was painless and took only a few days to heal. I was nervous but it was over in a minute and I didn't feel a thing. 'Having an infection was rubbish. 'You don't want these things to happen. 'But if it hadn't, there's no way I would have got to the clinic, where the staff were great. 'After I took out my lenses that day I threw them away but if I'd kept them I could have sent them off to find out what the bacteria was and how it caused my infection. 'I find it hard to understand how a contact lens could have damaged my eye so badly. 'I did everything right but still almost lost my sight.' Rising numbers of young people are suffering potentially devastating eye infections due to a lack of knowledge of the risks of contact lenses, say experts. Opticians advise adhering to the basic hygiene rules below, in order to protect the eyes from infection, injury and disease: .

He knows, with two years left on his £35,000-per-week deal, he holds the cards in discussions with one of the biggest clubs in English and European football.

He was born in Maverley, Kingston, a tough Jamaican community where gun crime is rife and drug gangs rule, before moving across the Atlantic aged five to join his mother Nadine in north London along with three siblings. Living on the St Raphael’s estate meant the sounds of gunshots were never far away. Police labelled the adjoining Stonebridge estate a warzone in 2005. Rival gangs engaged in tit-for-tat shootings. ‘They were all dealing in crack cocaine and it was a fight for territory,’ said Detective Inspector Stephen Horsley in 2009. Sterling had his football and his mother, a source of inspiration and guidance. But he failed to settle in a mainstream primary school because of behavioural problems, finding escape at the Vernon House Special School, which he attended for three years. A decade ago he began to take his sport seriously. The English youngster spent seven years at Queens Park Rangers before moving to Liverpool in 2010 . He joined QPR's Centre of Excellence aged 11, and within three years was starring for the Under 18s . He joined Queens Park Rangers’ Centre of Excellence aged 11, and within three years was starring for the Under 18s. Mark Anderson and Frank McParland, Liverpool’s youth scout and academy director respectively, spotted Sterling star in these games and began their pursuit. At this time Sterling was taken under the wing of Tom Walley, a veteran youth coach who has worked with Ashley Cole and David James. Sterling’s pay has rocketed since he left QPR, where he would have been earning around £400 per week. After his move north, his first pro contract at Liverpool was worth £2,000 per week and his current deal earns him £35,000 per week as previously mentioned.

Calvin writes that Spurs turned down the chance to sign Sterling for £200,000 because academy coaches were in disagreement over his long-term potential. Fulham were assured of his talent and had Sterling in their building before Liverpool swooped to take him to Merseyside aged 15 for £500,000. Shortly before travelling north, Sterling took part in Soccer Am’s Skill School challenge, facing another promising youngster Christain Nanetti. He is most recently of Dover Athletic, a tale of just how tough it is to make the kind of ascent Sterling has managed. He is close to completing his third full season as a Liverpool first-teamer having become the club’s second-youngest debutant aged 17 years and 107 days.

'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’ It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland.

They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb. Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks.

We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’ Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks.

True, they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – Bafetimbi Gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and David Meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match. They managed no shots on goal in the time it took Swansea to go 2-0 ahead through Ki Sung-Yueng and Gomis’s bicycle kick. And it was only in the second half that they mounted a challenge. As fate would have it, Meyler was sent off for fouling Kyle Naughton two minutes after Paul McShane had given Hull a lifeline. Gomis finished them in stoppage time. Bruce was exasperated. He said: ‘We were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first-half in particular. ‘But the two big decisions went against us and they could have turned the game. Gomis’ first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside. Gomis grabbed his second of the match after racing on to Jonjo Shelvey's pass and chipping McGregor in injury time .

Paul McShane pulled a goal back for Hull five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six-yard box . The Hull defender slotted past Lukasz Fabianski from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked . ‘We had got back into the game at 2-1 but unfortunately David has picked up a red card. I’ve seen it six times now and from three angles and to me it’s a perfectly decent challenge. ‘The other three I look at it and he takes part of the ball and the leg collides with the boy. We may as well say with these grey areas that you are not allowed to tackle if you tackle on the floor.’ The consequence of the challenge, beyond damage to Hull’s survival prospects, is that Naughton went to hospital for an X-ray on his ankle. Garry Monk said: ‘His ankle is really swollen. That is the real negative. We hope it is not serious. At the time I thought it was a genuine 50-50 challenge. My initial reaction was “bad challenge” but I don’t think there was any malice. You run that risk if your foot is high and goes over the ball.’ For Monk, it was the only complaint from a match that Swansea probably could have won in third gear. That’s no exaggeration in the context of how poor Hull were in the opening 45 minutes. For a team in that kind of mess, with those fixtures still to come, it was incomprehensible. That’s not to say Swansea stormed from the blocks. Ki’s opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game. Jonjo Shelvey had taken his usual punt from distance and while Allan McGregor did well to get down and save, his parry fell squarely at the feet of the South Korean. David Meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after McShane pulled a goal back for a lunge on Kyle Naughton .

Swansea right back Naughton limps from the field and has to be replaced by Angel Rangel following Meyler's tackle . Ki buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games. With seven this season, the deep-lying midfielder has become a delightfully complete player. It took 24 minutes for Hull to have their first chance – Abel Hernandez hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to Lukasz Fabianski. It wasn’t even on target. The rest of their attacks fizzled, a side with five across the middle seemingly incapable of holding possession. Gomis nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game. It really was a beautiful finish. Kyle Naughton delivered a ball into the area, Michael Dawson attempted to head clear and the striker buried a bicycle kick. Replays showed he had come back from an offside position, but the finish was magnificent. At that stage, Hull appeared out of it. Monk warned his side of complacency at the break and, in his words, ‘they did the total opposite’. It enabled Hull to pull one back after 49 minutes. Ashley Williams had tangled with Dame N’Doye and conceded a free-kick which Robbie Brady delivered from the right. Alex Bruce found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and McShane poked a finish past Fabianski. For two minutes Hull looked a genuine threat. And then, just as quickly, hope was gone. Meyler went high on Naughton and will miss the next three games. Ki Sung-Yueng opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an Allan McGregor save . Ki leads the celebrations after giving Garry Monk's side an early advantage at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull, to their credit, did not give up. But it was in their desperation for a leveller that they conceded a third. Nathan Dyer dispossessed Brady and Sigurdsson sent a long ball to Gomis. With none of Hull’s outfield players in their own half, the Frenchman had time to think before a nice chip over McGregor. In this strange old season of moans and a feint, he has also made his way to eight goals in all competitions. It will be interesting to see if his improved recent form has soothed some of the anger caused by his January agitations. It will be more interesting in the shorter term to see if Hull can find the significant improvement needed to get themselves out of this hole."}

The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14 Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino’s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. ‘He deserved it,’ he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. ‘He has the quality,’ he said. ‘So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).’ Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. ‘It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,’ Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City’s recent defeat here and complained that ‘long balls into the box’ made Sean Dyche’s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal’s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. ‘Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??’ tweeted Darren Anderton.

Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game — they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England’s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham’s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson’s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team’s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

It was Boyd’s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. ‘I think we edged the game,’ said Dyche afterwards. ‘Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he’s probably just hit too cleanly. But I’m pleased by the fact that we’ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.’ Not that there was much evidence of that here.

Poland international Lewandowski scored the winner on his first visit back to the club he left on a free transfer last summer as Pep Guardiola's side restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.

Click here to read Nicholas Godden's full match report . Host commentator . League leaders Bayern Munich stretch their lead at the top of the table to 10 points. Former Dortmund man Lewandowski scored the only goal of the match to give his side the win. The home team deserved a point, however Guardiola's side dug deep to hold on and claim yet another vital victory. It seems like Dortmund are going to run out of time to claim an equaliser. They are missing a Lewandowski or Gotze to provide that extra bit of quality in the final third. Dortmund were awarded a free-kick in a fantastic position. Reus tests his international team-mate but Neuer shows his class by stretching down to his right. He has to be the best goalkeeper in the world despite the form of De Gea and Courtois. Klopp has done all he can in terms of substitutions and tactical tweaks. It now rests with the likes of Kagawa and Reus to inspire the home side to at least claim a point. And they would be fully worthy of a point as they have impressed since the interval. Former Dortmund playmaker Gotze replaces Muller in the hole behind Lewandowski while Mkhitaryan comes on for Gundogan as Klopp's side chase an equaliser. Alonso is booked for pulling back Kagawa's shirt. 15 minutes left to play. Talking of players back from injury, Thiago is playing his first match of the season after being ruled out of action with a knee injury since March 2014. Lahm's first start of the season lasts 69 minutes as he is replaced by Thiago. Guardiola will be delighted to have his captain back after his lengthy spell on the sidelines. Kagawa gets his chance to impress as he comes on along with Ramos. Dortmund are starting to apply more pressure on Bayern's defence. The next goal, if there is one, will be crucial. Reus should have finally tested Neuer, who is yet to make a save, however he manages to hit his shot wide of the goal. He literally had a free run at goal and had time to aim his strike. Here's a stat for you - Manuel Neuer is yet to make a save during the first 60 minutes of the match. Schweinsteiger, who was on a yellow card, has been replaced with Rode with just over half an hour to go. Klopp will surely look to freshen up his side during the next 10 minutes. Dortmund have an early penalty shout as Reus is appended by Boateng however the referee waves play on. Reus went down in dramatic fashion which didn't work in his favour. Staff at the Signal Iduna Park had to remove a number of objects off of the field of play before the second half kicked off. The Yellow Wall appeared to chuck bananas at Manuel Neuer. Former Manchester United midfielder Kagawa or Mkhitaryan will surely feature in the second half if Dortmund's current attacking players fail to cancel out Lewandowski's opener. Lewandowski chose not to celebrate on his return to the Signal Iduna Park. What do you think about players who choose to respect their former sides? Have your say below! Owen Hargreaves: 'I thought Dortmund were terrific in the first 20 minutes but then they allowed Alonso to dictate play. It was a bit of a mistake by Hummels as he failed to make a tackle.' Dortmund have come into the game since Lewandowski's goal but they are yet to really trouble Neuer and Bayern's three-man backline. Just one minute left to play of the first half. Lewandowski scores the opener against his former side by nodding home from close range after Muller's shot was saved. The Polish striker chooses not to celebrate after spending four years at Dortmund. Muller and Lewandowski are linking up well but they are missing the pace and creativity of Robben and Ribery. Guardiola will be desperate to have the pair back for their upcoming Champions League ties against Porto. They play in yellow and now another one of their players has earned himself a yellow. Schmelzer becomes the second Dortmund star to be cautioned for a late challenge. Just under 30 minutes gone at the Signal Iduna Park. Aubameyang becomes the second player to go into the book. Both sets of players look fired up while the Signal Iduna Park crowd are jeering Bayern's every touch. Referee Knut Kircher has dipped into his pocket to dish out the first yellow card of the match. The experienced Schweinsteiger will have to be careful in order to avoid seeing red. Reus looks like he is going to cause Bayern Munich problems today. Alonso could have been cautioned for a reckless foul on the Dortmund playmaker as he ran through the middle of the pitch. Klopp certainly thought he deserved a yellow. The Polish striker put the balls into the net against his former side but he is rightly flagged offside by the German officials. Subotic moved up to ensure Lewandowski was unable to put his side in the lead. Remains 0-0. Bayern goalkeeper Neuer loves to have the ball at his feet and you can see his defenders are confident of his ability as they constantly play it back to the German international. Muller, who is playing just behind Lewandowski, tries to lift the ball over Weidenfeller and into Dortmund's goal however his effort goes just wide of the post. Bayern have set up with a three-man defence with Bernat and Rafinha providing the width in the absence of Ribery and Robben. The two sides are currently paying their respect to those who died after the German Wings plane crash. Owen Hargreaves: 'A lot of clubs will be after Hummels in the summer. However I do not think he is the kind of player Manchester United need. They need a powerful defender rather than a ball player.' If the German Clasico doesn't tickle your fancy then you can follow the live action from Chelsea's match against Stoke by joining Dan Ripley HERE. Both Klopp and Guardiola have quality to call on from their respective benches with the likes of Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Gotze and Thiago among the substitutes. Dortmund subs: Kehl, Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Ramos, Langerak, Ginter, Dudziak . Bayern Munich subs: Thiago, Pizarro, Guadino, Gotze, Rode, Reina, Weiser . Second-placed Wolfsburg defeated Stuttgart 3-1 earlier today to close the gap on Bayern, however Pep Guardiola's side are still seven points clear at the top. Dortmund, on the other hand, have struggled to replicate the form they had previously shown in the last few seasons. Jurgen Klopp's side are currently languishing in 10th spot. Manchester United fans will be keen to get a closer look at summer target Mats Hummels. The German defender reportedly told former Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson that he would move to Old Trafford if he was to leave Dortmund. Read the full story HERE. Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm makes his first Bundesliga start since returning from an ankle injury to strengthen Pep Guardiola's side. The Spaniard are without the injured Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery for today's match. The teams are in at the Signal Iduna Park where Bayern will be hoping to stretch their seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table by defeating Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund XI vs Bayern Munich: Weidenfeller; Sokratis, Subotic, Hummels, Schmelzer; Gundogan, Bender; Błaszczykowski, Reus, Kampl; Aubameyang . Bayern Munich XI vs Dortmund: Neuer; Dante, Boateng, Benatia; Rafinha, Alonso, Bernat, Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Muller; Lewandowski . Borussia Dortmund may have had a Bundesliga season to forget, but there is nothing they would like more than to beat the runaway leaders and their rivals Bayern Munich. Pep Guardiola takes his German champions and Bundesliga leaders to Signal Iduna Park for 'Der Klassiker' on Saturday evening hoping to avoid any slip-ups in their quest for another title. Bayern hold a 10-point lead over second-placed Wolfsburg with just eight games to play and will be eager to wrap up their third straight title as soon as possible. Kick off: 5:30pm BST ."}

Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, was found slumped in a Volkswagen Passat on Wednesday morning in Wembley. The imam, described as 'the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet', had gun  wounds to the chest. He was said to have been embroiled in dispute with his former workplace, the An-Noor mosque in Acton, where he had been replaced by Hassan Anyabwile from Trinidad and Tobago. The  name of Mr Anyabwile, 53, appears in Caribbean parliament documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen. Hassan Anywabwile (left) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Abdul Arwani (right) at the An-Noor Mosque in Acton. Mr Arwani was found dead on Wednesday with bullet wounds in his chest . Mr Arwani stepped down from his role at the mosque last year after it was repeatedly linked to extremism. When contacted, staff at the An-Noor Mosque refused to answer questions about the former preacher's time there . Over the course of six days, almost 100 members of the Islamic organisation were involved in holding hostages at gunpoint in the island's capital, Port of Spain. The city's police headquarters were blown up in the coup, with Mr Anyabwile described by a Parliamentary report of being 'responsible for organising the use' of the explosives involved. The coup ended after six days with the insurgents' surrendering on the condition of amnesty on August 1. Twenty-four people had been killed in the anarchy. It is understood Mr Anyabwile replaced Mr Arwani at the An-Noor mosque in Acton, West London, some time around 2013. He is registered as having lived in London since 2005. Mr Arwani stepped down from the An-Noor mosque last year following repeated accusations that it was linked to extremism. When approached this afternoon Mr Anyabwile, who became partially disabled after being shot four times in legs, denied any knowledge of any dispute. Anyabwile is named in a Trinidadian parliamentary report on an attempted coup which saw 24 people killed in 1990. He is described as being 'responsible' for the use of explosives in the blowing of police headquarters . Mr Anyabwile did not comment on claims Mr Arwani had been embroiled in a dispute with the mosque when approached . Arriving for midday prayers the man, who was helped into a wheelchair by a security guard, told the MailOnline: 'Feud? I know nothing about that. 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' When contacted today another member of staff at the mosque refused to answer questions about Mr Arwani's time there. A statement printed on a piece of paper and taped to its front door read: 'We have with great sadness heard of the unfortunate death of Shaykh [sic] Abdulhadi Arwarni who was the former Imam of the Annoor [sic] Cultural & Community Centre who served from 2005 to 2011, he will be sadly missed. 'We send our sympathies and condolences to his family, the Muslim community and friends. May Allah forgive him and open the doors of mercy onto him.' But one friend of the late imam said the dispute between the father of six and the An-Noor Mosque had been heated. Solicitor Mohammad Bassam Tablieh, 43, said there had been conflict about the 'running' of the mosque. There is no suggestion that either Mr Anyabwile or the An-Noor mosque in Acton is suspected of  any involvement in his death, with counter terrorism police still investigating. Scotland Yard officers called in the specialist division because 'of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. 'The investigation remains in its very early stages and officers remain open-minded about the motive,' a spokesman added. Earlier this week sources close to the Mr Arwani said they feared he may have been killed by supporters of the Syrian president Bashar-al-Assad - of whom the imam was a fierce critic. Describing his father as 'the most peaceful man you could meet,' one of his six children, Murhaf, said he was 'actively involved in the fight against extremism'. 'He did not care what your background, race or status was. He did not care if you were rich or poor. 'He just wanted to help people in need. He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it,' he said in a statement. Later his 23-year-old daughter, Elham Arwani, said while her father was openly 'against Assad', she did not think that was the reason behind his killing. Mr Arwani's family said they did not believe his death was connected to his opposition of the Assad regime. Speaking at the family home (above), his 23-year-old daughter said that was likely 'not the reason' Anyabwile was involved in the attempted coup of Trinidad and Tobago in 1990. Above, a rebel fighter stands with his AK-47 during the six-day standoff . Almost 25 years ago, around 100 members of the radical Islamic group Jamaat-al-Muslimeen stormed Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament in Port of Spain. They were demanding that the then Prime Minister, Arthur Robinson, resign and that new elections be held, accusing the leader of wild extravagance while, they said, its working classes went hungry. The rebels blew up Port of Spain's police headquarters and stormed a state-run television channel in a bid to take control of the Trinidadian capital. The Muslimeen's leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, appeared ominously on air during the first day of the coup attempt. Among one of their hostages was Mr Robinson. The Prime Minister was shot and beaten during the six-day coup. Violence and looting ravaged the city as all those who had been in the buildings when the Muslimeen stormed remained in their capture. On its sixth day, the rebels agreed to surrender on the condition of amnesty - releasing what remaining hostages they were keeping unharmed. They were all arrested and charged with treason but later released after producing copies of an amnesty that had been agreed when brokering an end to the coup. Anyabwile, formerly known in the Caribbean as Beville Marshall, is thought to have separated from the Muslimeen in 2001. Years later he was shot four times in the legs, leaving him in need of a wheelchair. He had tried to establish his own Islamist group, according to the Trinidadian press. In 2004 a local report claimed he had been turned down for asylum by the Home Office having told them that his life would be in danger if he returned to the Caribbean island. The attempted coup brought the island's capital to a standstill with looting and violence rife for days . But friends and neighbours claimed critics of the Assad regime had been targeted in the area, with some residents who displayed green flags, a sign of opposition to the Syrian government, having their tyres slashed. Mr Arwani grew up in Hama, the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the Syrian Army under the orders of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. He fled the country as a 16-year-old, taking refuge in the UK while his parents faced routine questioning of his whereabouts for years. One of the mourners who gathered in his memory at Nadi Park Royal in Willesden Junction, north west London, said he had returned to Syria in recent years to dissuade fighters from aligning themselves with the Government. The source claimed Mr Arwani stopped going to the country on advice from the Turkish authorities. The An-Noor Mosque, where Mr Arwani used to be one of the main imams, has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers. It became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for 16 months, and was last seen entering An-Noor dressed as a man before leaving in a full-length covering designed for women which obscured his identity. He was subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism. Other extremists linked to the mosque include Uthman Mustafa Kamal, the son of hate preacher Abu Hamza, who has regularly led prayers at An-Noor."}

No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament."}

Last year’s winner Luis Suarez now resides in Spain, so, too, does 2013 victor Gareth Bale. It means we’re almost certain to see a new name on the trophy come May. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the six leading contenders… . Name: Harry Kane . Club: Tottenham . Age: 21 . Stats: Apps 44, Goals 29 . Striker Harry Kane has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for Tottenham so far this season . Kane (second right) has twice been named Player of the Month during his breakthrough campaign . Kane (left) broke into the England squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania . Reasons he deserves it: Very few would have predicted Kane would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early April in what is essentially his breakthrough season. His has been the name on everyone’s lips since the turn of the year and last month’s England call-up was thoroughly deserved. In an age where diving, spitting, lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda, Kane’s goal-laden arrival has been a joy to witness. Reasons he doesn’t: Are there any? You could argue it took him until November to score two Premier League goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities. Previous (individual) Premier League honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: Eden Hazard . Club: Chelsea . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 44, Goals 17 . Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's outstanding performer, scoring 17 times in 44 games . Hazard (left) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate . Hazard (centre) is the odds-on favourite to be named PFA Players' Player of the Year . Reasons he deserves it: He’s running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they’ll edge Chelsea towards the title. Hazard, under the instruction of Jose Mourinho, has married graft to his craft and has been his side’s outstanding player this season. The fact he works so hard in addition to his creativity is sure to earn the respect of fellow pros and it’s no surprise he is the odds-on favourite for the prize. Reasons he doesn’t: Like Kane, it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis. It did, however, take the Belgian a little while to find his scoring stride and he netted just once in the opening nine matches of the campaign. Previous honours: PFA Young Player of the Year 2014, PFA Team of the Year 2013 & 2014 . Name: Diego Costa . Club: Chelsea . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 30, Goals 18 . Reasons he deserves it: His immediate impact was sensational, smashing seven goals in his first four outings. His presence as the spearhead of Chelsea’s attack has turned them into title winners and he isn’t afraid to put in a shift either. Diego Costa has spearheaded Chelsea's attack this season, with 18 goals in 30 appearances . Costa (right) fires in the winner for Chelsea in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield . Costa's bid to become Player of the Year could be hampered by the games he has missed through injury . Reasons he doesn’t: He’s missed too many games because of injury, as well as suspension, and is too often on our back pages for the wrong reasons. It is that edge which will probably dissuade fellow pros from voting for the Spaniard. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Sergio Aguero . Club: Manchester City . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 31, Goals 23 . Reasons he deserves it: Without his goals City’s title challenge would have faded long ago. It has been a poor season at the Etihad. Aguero, though, has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance. His four goals against Spurs and match-winning treble versus Bayern Munich are among the best individual performances of the season. Meanwhile, he was so devastating during his two-goal show at Sunderland that the home crowd rose to applaud the Argentine when he made way late on. Sergio Aguero has again been in prolific scoring form for Manchester City, blasting 23 goals in  31 matches . Aguero (right) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015 . Reasons he doesn’t: If Aguero managed to avoid what are all-too-frequent visits to the treatment room then City might be pushing Chelsea harder for the league title. He only has three league goals in 2015 and, while his numbers remain impressive, that lack of consistency will cost him votes. Previous honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: David de Gea . Club: Manchester United . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 37, Clean sheets 13 . David de Gea (left) has been outstanding for Manchester United with 13 clean sheets this season . De Gea shone for United in the early part of the Premier League campaign when United struggled for form . De Gea's displays have been integral to United's top-four charge and he has been their best player . Reasons he deserves it: Only De Gea was spared criticism as United struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season. Indeed, there was an argument that, without his points-saving heroics, Louis van Gaal might have come under pressure far sooner. He has matured into the goalkeeper Sir Alex Ferguson thought he would and it is little wonder he is now being courted by the likes of Real Madrid. Reasons he doesn’t: Only the goalkeeper in a title-winning side would land the PFA prize, you feel. For while De Gea has been United’s best player, he has not single-handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the Premier League crown. Previous honours: PFA Team of the Year 2013 . Name: Alexis Sanchez . Club: Arsenal . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 43, Goals 20 . Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running at Arsenal following his Barcelona switch, with 20 goals in 43 games . Sanchez hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season . Chile international Sanchez has added greater aggression to Arsenal's attacking line with his arrival . Reasons he deserves it: There was a suspicion it would take the Chilean time to settle in the Premier League. Well, he didn’t score in his first four matches but then embarked on a run which yielded 14 in 18. His energy, aggression and will to win – coupled with bags of quality – has made all to the difference to an Arsenal side previously lacking in such vigour. Reasons he doesn’t: His goals have dried up since January and his awesome autumn could well be forgotten by the time votes are cast. However, he is still a certainty for Arsenal’s individual annual honours. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Jordan Henderson . Club: Liverpool . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 45, Goals 7 . Reasons he deserves it: He has emerged as Liverpool’s future captain having taken on responsibility in the centre of the park. Henderson barely misses a minute and is now a certain starter for his country – not bad for a player who Sir Alex Ferguson said could not run properly. He’s also added goals to his game and is a real pro’s pro – it would be no surprise to see him land his fair share of the votes. Jordan Henderson (centre) has continued his development into an essential player for Liverpool this season . Henderson emerged as Liverpool's future captain with Steven Gerrard (right) leaving at the end of the season . Henderson has added more goals to his game and has been ever present throughout Liverpool's campaign . Reasons he doesn’t: It hasn’t been a vintage year for Liverpool and their bid for Champions League football looks set to end in failure. As good as Henderson has been, this will almost certainly cost him the top prize. Previous honours: None . VERDICT: If the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season’s Young Player of the Year, Eden Hazard. However, don’t underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards Harry Kane within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes. And that Roy of the Rovers tale would be a victory for everything we love about the game. Kane certainly gets my vote!"}

Two goals by Ander Herrera and a special one from Wayne Rooney were enough to sweep aside lowly opponents  and took United up to third place, a point ahead of neighbours Manchester City who play Crystal Palace on Monday before they are up next at the Theatre of Dreams. Even more importantly, Van Gaal's side are now eight points clear of Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool in fifth. It means his number one priority, restoring Champions League football to Old Trafford, has nearly been achieved. In terms of performance, it was something of the old, something of the new. United used width as their tradition demands with former Villa winger Ashley Young seeing a lot of the ball on the left. But there was a lot of patience and possession too. United had 72% of the ball without a lot to show for it until the reward came after 43 minutes. Daley Blind overlapped for the umpteenth time and on this occason his cutback to Herrera was perfect for the Spaniard to drill home. The second goal didn't arrive until 11 minutes from the end but was worth the wait. Angel Di Maria, on as a substitute, chipped the ball behind Rooney, but the England striker still found a way to score. He fully extended his left luminous green boot, brought the ball under control with his first touch and then spun 180 degrees to lash home his finish on the half-volley with his right. On such goals has the Theatre of Dreams acquired its reputation. But surprisingly there was still work to do for United because David de Gea let a Christian Benteke shot squirm through his body almost immediately aftewards.

It was only when Herrera added his second goal that van Gaal's men were totally safe though anything other than three points would have been a travesty on the balance of play. 'I wanted to come here and compete, and I thought we did that,' said Villa boss Tim Sherwood. 'But United have players who have been round the block, they know when to speed it up and slow it down. The goal just before half-time killed us.' FA Cup semi-finalists Villa could be in the bottom three when they face QPR at home on Tuesday night in a genuine relegation six-pointer. But they will be without a string of injured players including Alan Hutton. taken off at half-time yesterday with an ankle injury, Scott Sinclair, Ashley Westwood and Kieran Richardson. 'I've never known anything like it. Ridiculous,' said Sherwood. Van Gaal was simply relieved to get United's first game after the international break out the way. 'I was afraid before this match because we were playing against a very defensive organisaton. That is not easy to create chances and score goals,' he said.

Herrera shows his emotion at scoring United's opener as he is congratulated by his Old Trafford team-mates . On two-goal Herrera, he added: 'He has always been very good technically but sometimes was not composed at the right moment. But he is developing. He has scored seven goals now.' Villa defended well in the first-half with Marcos Rojo going closest with a long-range shot that was tipped over by Brad Guzan. For long periods, Rooney cut an unhappy figure, beating the turf in frustration and arguing with referee Roger East after beind denied a penalty for Ciaran Clark's early challenge in the area where he seemed to grab the United striker by the back of the neck. If Rooney reflects on it later, maybe his over-dramatic fall to the ground persauded the official not to award a spot-kick. The deadlock was eventually broken when United passed and passed long enough for Blind to escape free down the left. The Dutchman picked out Herrera and he converted from 12 yards for his first goal at Old Trafford since September. When United couldn't get a second goal with Marouane Fellaini going closest, van Gaal sent on Di Maria and Falcao, combined value £103million. Former Villa winger Young made way to jeers from the away fans and cheers from everyone else after a decent display.

However any hope of a Villa comeback were quashed when Herrera (right) added a third in injury time . Di Maria claimed an assist for Rooney's special, pinging the ball across from the touchline. 'He has 10 assists,' pointed out van Gaal, though he baulked at being asked why the winger hadn't started. 'You think we should always pick the most expensive XI? I think not,' was the manager's retort. Surprisingly, David de Gea gave Villa brief hope to make the game 2-1. Herrera gave the scoreline a realistic edge when he burst forward into the penalty area once again to fire past Guzan. The Manchester derby next Sunday is going to be a cracker.

Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator . Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson . ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they’re all on fresh tyres. Here we go… . Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go… . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap… . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign."}

We have assembled two dream teams - one featuring players from the Premier League clubs in the South of England and the other featuring Northern-based stars. On Monday, Rob Draper revealed who he'd select in the Southern XI and on Tuesday, Joe Bernstein did likewise for the North. We then sent the All-star teams to our friends at Football Manager, who have simulated the match. Here's what happened... So, now we know: the South has the edge over the North for footballing talent. Alexis Sanchez and Harry Kane were the heroes as the Southern All-Stars came out on top in our simulated clash between the Premier League's best players from the North and South. Despite falling behind less than a minute into the game to a stunning finish from Sergio Aguero, who was supported up front by Wayne Rooney, the Southern XI were able to mount a fightback with a brace from Sanchez either side of Harry Kane's second-half goal. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE SIMULATED MATCH . Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal (left) starred in our simulated All-Star game, while Spurs striker Harry Kane (right) also scored in the match . Manchester City hotshot Sergio Aguero gave the Northern combined XI the lead after less than a minute, but his team were still beaten . The Southern All-Stars boasted Harry Kane up front while the Northern side was led by Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney . The Southerners saw less of the ball and created fewer chances but were more clinical in front of goal than the Northern All-Stars, who twice hit the woodwork. After Aguero's early strike, the South battled back and went close through Morgan Schneiderlin and John Terry. Their pressure was rewarded when Sanchez linked up with Kane and buried his shot  from inside the area. Kane added his name to the scoresheet in the second half with a well-taken finish following some lovely build-up play by Eden Hazard, Santi Cazorla and Schneiderlin. Sanchez then rounded off the victory with a clinical, powerful effort 20 minutes from time. The Northern team were made to rue missed opportunities after creating three clear-cut chances to the South's two but didn't convert them . Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez is the stand-out in Football Manager's player ratings with 6.1 while Martin Skrtel was least effective for the North . The Northerners enjoyed marginally more possession than their rivals and won 13 corners but failed to kick on after Aguero's opener . The Southerners’ manager Rob Draper will be delighted by his team's smooth transitions from defence to attack, and their elaborate passing play in the middle of the park. It could well have been a different story, however, had Joe Bernstein's Northern side been able to convert their chances. Martin Skrtel will be unhappy with his performance in the centre of defence too. The men in red looked threatening on the flanks, particularly through Raheem Sterling, but far too often they failed to capitalise on his excellent service. Aguero conspired to miss from six yards out when unmarked in injury-time to sum up their profligacy. That meant a comfortable margin of victory by two goals for the Southern All-Stars and bragging rights over their Northern neighbours. But, somehow, we suspect the old debate over which half of England reigns supreme will continue. MATCH HIGHLIGHTS (SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE SIMULATION) 1st minute: GOAL!!! The pre-match hype is immediately justified as Sergio Aguero picks up a short pass from James McCarthy, dribbles past Jose Fonte and curls the ball past Thibaut Courtois to make it 1-0 to the Northern All-Stars. Aguero (centre, in red) slots home the opening goal in the very first minute of the All-Stars clash . 8th minute: A Santi Cazorla corner finds the head of John Terry but his effort is fractionally too high. Santi Cazorla's pinpoint corner finds captain John Terry at the near post but the Chelsea legend's header clears the crossbar . 10th minute: Raheem Sterling forces Courtois into a decent save with a powerful effort from the edge of the area. 20th minute: A well-worked move by the Southern All-Stars culminates in a Morgan Schneiderlin volley from 25 yards that whistles over Joe Hart’s crossbar. 21st minute: A Cazorla free-kick is deflected out for a corner. The delivery from the Spaniard is poor and the Northern All-Stars break with Sterling. After beating two defenders, he elects to try and curl one in from the 18-yard mark but his effort drifts wide of the goal. 29th minute: GOAL!!! A misplaced pass from Aguero gives away possession when the Northern All-Stars look threatening. The Southern All-Stars take full advantage with a direct move down the right flank. The ball finds its way to Kane, who plays a pinpoint pass to Sanchez to calmly slot the ball into the bottom corner and level the match. Sanchez (top, in blue) slots past Joe Hart in the Northern XI's goal to score the equaliser . 36th minute: Some clever interplay between Rooney and Aguero opens up the Southern All-Star defence . 39th minute: More good play from Aguero and Rooney creates a half-chance for the Northern All-Stars but the Argentina striker drags his shot wide. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin attempts an ambitious volley from 25 yards but it meets the same fate as Terry's header . HALF-TIME: Southern All-Stars 1-1 Northern All-Stars . Substitution: Michael Carrick is replaced by Yaya Toure. 46th minute: The Northern All-Stars very nearly take the lead straight from kick-off after more good work on the right from Sterling. He slips the ball into Rooney, whose shot is turned onto the post by Courtois. 57th minute: Substitution: David Silva makes way for Ashley Young. 60th minute: Substitution: Phil Jones replaces Ryan Shawcross after the Stoke man takes a knock from a robust Alexis Sanchez challenge. The Northern All-Stars have used all their substitutions. 66th minute: Double Substitution: Nathaniel Clyne and Nemanja Matic are subbed off for Branislav Ivanovic and Fabian Delph. Following the substitutions, the Northern All-Stars push forward with Toure giving the team more purpose in the middle of the park. Toure's raking through ball is met by Sterling who thinks he has made it 2-1 only for the linesman to raise his flag. 68th minute: GOAL!!! Courtois sends the resulting free-kick long and the Southern All-Stars work the ball to Schneiderlin on the edge of the area. His through ball to Kane is weighted to perfection and the striker races onto it before slotting home to put his team in front. Kane (second right, in blue) raises his arm in celebration after putting the Southern All-Stars in front for the first time . 72nd minute: GOAL!!! The Southern All-Stars wrap up the match with Sanchez’s second goal. More intricate build-up play in the midfield allows Sanchez to lose his man, take a touch and hit a powerful effort that beats Hart. Sanchez (bottom right, in blue) notches his second goal of the game to settle the contest at Wembley . 81st minute: From a throw-in on the left, Young feeds Aguero, who has acres of space ahead of him and men arriving in the box. He chooses to go it alone but Courtois makes a comfortable save down to his right. Aguero storms into the box and ignores support on his inside to take a shot from a tight angle, but it's easily saved by Thibaut Courtois . 83rd minute: A corner from the Northern All-Stars is only half cleared to Young but his shot is blasted into the side netting. 88th minute: The Northern All-Stars work an opening from a free-kick but Rooney’s effort is poor and straight at Courtois. 90+2: The simplest chance of the match falls to Aguero in injury-time after a superb low cross from Sterling. The Manchester City star is unmarked six yards out but can only hit the post. Rooney collects the ball and gets another shot away but Courtois palms it out for a corner. Aguero blows his chance to make the scoreline a little more respectable late on when he hits the upright after low cross from Sterling . 90+3: The resulting corner amounts to nothing and the referee blows the final whistle. FULL TIME: Southern All-Stars 3-1 Northern All-Stars ."}

When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross . Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season . If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. Aston Villa (4-4-2): Guzan 6; Bacuna 6, Vlaar 5.5, Clark 6, Richardson 6; Cleverley 6.5, Sanchez 6.5, Delph 7, Grealish 6.5; Agbonlahor 7.5, Benteke 8 . Manager: Tim Sherwood 7 .

Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood threw down his gilet in celebration after Benteke scored the early equaliser .

Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2 . Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal . Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR . At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points . But Benteke's wonder free-kick, much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night, meant Villa came away with a point . Benteke can't conceal his delight at completing his hat-trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute . Good friends Chris Ramsey (left) and Sherwood know each other well and were going head-to-head in the dugout for the first time . Former Villa striker Stan Collymore couldn't hit his elation in the press box after Benteke knocked in his second of the goal . Sherwood urges the supporters packed inside Villa Park to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble . Charlie Austin vies for possession with Kieran Richardson during an intense and entertaining first half . Niko Kranjcar attempts to get QPR back in the game but couldn't steer his effort beyond the American Guzan . Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post. Are they man enough? Only time will tell."}

Tiger Woods had worked so hard on his short game, the other quality needed to take a safe passage through these parts had been forgotten. He chipped like a champion; he drove like a boy racer. Somewhere in the ether, golf’s gods pointed and mocked. So Tiger’s short game is killing him? Opposite. There has been so much yip yap these last few weeks it was forgotten that Woods was becoming more erratic off the tee, long before his chipping went west. From the first, when he drifted into a bunker on the right, to the final par five, when he fired one into the crowd, castigating himself as a ‘dumbass’ — although a shout of ‘fore’ might have been more helpful — Woods took the long road around Augusta. The galleries were packed as crowd favourite Tiger Woods struggled on his first round at Augusta . Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell . Woods feels the heat at Augusta with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round . That he recorded a relatively respectable score — some significant distance off the lead, but certainly in the ball park of what would have been considered a reasonable number given that this was his first competitive golf for two months — was testament to his cussedness as much as his talent. Tiger dug deep and his play around the greens saved him. It was remarkable, really, considering his crisis of confidence. On the sixth, a par three, Woods missed the green again. He looked more than irritated, he looked worn down, fed up with a sport he once held on a string. He no doubt remembers how it used to be, too. How he must miss that old Tiger. He walked to the ball, perched at the top of a small incline to the right of the green. And he putted it. Rolled it down the slope, got it near enough. Settled. But, even so, it was a tell. The best poker players don’t have tells and Tiger likes Las Vegas as much as any high roller. But he saw his hand and, on that occasion, he blinked. It was still a Tiger gallery, of course. Still the biggest, still primed to applaud even the tiniest glimmer of his genius. But they would have recognised this as Tiger bluffing. Rewind through a decade and he would have conjured something small and miraculous with a short iron, made the ball pitch and spit and stop almost at his command. He would have shown the mastery of a charmer with a mesmerised snake. Putting from off the green? That was for the old guys and the also-rans, those without the bravery or the genius to make the ball obey. So Tiger got it close and made the solid up and down. Sure, they’re part of the game and every pro relies on them, even the all-time greats. But he was coming to need them, more and more. He won’t be entirely comfortable with that. He couldn’t putt at the 11th, when he again missed right and left himself a rascal of a chip. If Tiger’s short game was as bad as it had looked last time, the ball could easily have taken a bath. Instead, he recovered, just like old times. Then put it in the water at the 12th instead. Golf’s gods thumbed their noses and pulled faces behind his back. ‘I made two dumb mistakes,’ said Woods. ‘That apart, it was a good day. The short game was my strength, it was the reason I worked my butt off — to make it my strength again.’ Even so, dramatic saves weren’t all the old Tiger was about. There was a shot on the seventh that would have been a contender for play of the day. That is why they continue to hurry when he has played, no matter the needs of his patient partners. Tiger hits and off they go to see Tiger hit again. But Tiger is hitting more and more. Not the 82 times he hit at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in January perhaps, but more times than he would have hit in such benign conditions at Augusta in the old days, when he wouldn’t have been so pleased to tie for 41st place after 18 holes. Still, the seventh. Boy it was a beauty. He was behind a tree, left of the fairway, barely in sight of the green. He took a giant hit, dug it out but with such power and ferocity. The crowd lost the flight, the cameraman too, but Woods didn’t. He skipped and peered around the forestry to see the ball drop out of the sky, onto the green to a Sunday afternoon reception. Momentarily it was 1997 all over again. And then it was 2015 again and he left his 25 footer short. Par. Woods was not impressed with his approach shot to the 10th, but he managed to salvage par on the hole . Woods' beau Lindsey Vonn was in attendance as her other half mopped his sopping brow with a towel . Woods, Jimmy Walker and Jamie Donaldson walk to the 6th green during an absorbing day's play . Increasingly, his gallery writes cheques the man in the arena cannot cash. They were 14 rows deep just to watch him walk the ten strides from putting green to first tee. Eight on one side, six on the other, five marshals, wrestling with rope, and several baseball-hatted G4 security men. A local sheriff marched past, perspiring through his regulation white shirt. Even for Augusta in April it was unseasonably warm: 89, according to the Weather Channel. It was approaching 1.48pm Eastern Time. Tiger o’clock. The 14 rows fidgeted expectantly. Tiger breezed through, to applause, cheers and the odd whoop; the love of the common people. He nodded in appreciation once, mouthed a noiseless thank you, smiled a tight anti-smile. And then he was gone. Swallowed up as the ropes dropped and the crowd fell in behind him. Will he, won’t he? Could he, couldn’t he? They had seen the man, but would they ever see The Man? He was coming here with a new game, and a new mindset, but was this a new Tiger? Woods lines up his putt on the par three sixth as the 15-time major winner had a solid start to the day . Woods shows his fury at a chip from a bunker on the fourth,  but he managed to steady the ship . Woods patrols the Augusta fairways on a largely frustrating round for the former world No 1 . No. Not a new Tiger like the old Tiger anyway. Too much, too soon. He was better than the Tiger that departed Torrey Pines in February, with fears for his long-term future. Better for all that graft, that sun up to sun down perseverance. But he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world. A bit rusty, a bit erratic, a bit brilliant, a bit fallible. There were fine moments, but they were fleeting. He got better through the round, but he would have eaten this place alive in the good old days. And that is Tiger’s problem. It’s a bit like Al Pacino in Carlito’s Way. Every time he tries to get out, they pull him back in. The creaks, the chunks, the odd crisis of confidence that just wasn’t there before. He starts to get going, he works his ass off, but it is hard. He three-putted the first, birdied the second. Hit a tree off the tee on the third, but got a lucky kick onto the fairway. Found a bunker, then missed the green on the par three fourth, played a quite stunning second from a poor fairway lie on the fifth. It was the golf of a competitor still battling against the years, and the aches of a creaking back and — whisper it — maybe yips that could resurface at any time. He won’t go quietly, the competitor remains, but he is vulnerable now. If it is isn’t one thing, it’s the other. Woods wills his second shot from the 14th on with the galleries gripped on the unfolding soap opera . Woods looks anxiously as his tee shot from the 15th sails into the still Georgia skies on a perfect day for golf . Woods finished the day at one over as he looks forlornly at a shot on the eighth ."}

Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world. You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters . The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game . Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 . It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it . The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday . Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta . ‘It would be my 15th major,’ said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children,  Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice . Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice . As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world’s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam — only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. ‘He wasn’t doing anything good,’ he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third, considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career. Woods shot the worst round of his professional career, an 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open . Woods speaks to the world's media after withdrawing from the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open . The 14 major winner stands at the tee as the Augusta course is mowed ahead of this year's tournament . ‘People would never understand how much work I put in to come back and do this again,’ he said. ‘I worked my ass off, that’s the easiest way to describe it. I worked hard. Sun up to sun down. When the kids were in school, I’d be doing it. When they went to sleep, still doing it. ‘The way I saw it, if I started when the sun came up I’d be a better player when it set. Getting better incrementally. It would come in flashes. It would come for 10 minutes and then I’d lose it for an hour. Then I’d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I’d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances. ‘But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained. I just had to get through it.’ Woods smiles after winning his last major in a play-off with Rocco Mediate at the 2008 US Open . The all conquering American celebrates winning the Masters after sinking a play-off putt in 2005 . Nick Faldo slips the green jacket on Woods after he won his first major at the 1997 Masters . And now he’s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn’t help that the man in Woods’s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street’s Monday morning figures, and golf’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods’s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That’s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. ‘I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,’ he said. ‘I’ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn’t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn’t seize the opportunity.’ The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing . Woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from American supporters and beyond . The room seemed pleased with the answer. Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. ‘Winning,’ deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. ‘I like it,’ he said, before disappearing through a side door. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that. For now."}

Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend . Lee Clayton . Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season . Ian Ladyman . I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge . Dominic King . It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . Nick Harris . Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January . Riath Al-Samarrai . Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge . Laurie Whitwell . Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD . Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park . Sami Mokbel . Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February . Jack Gaughan . From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD . Sam Cunningham . Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend . Craig Hope . I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD . RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA . Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey ."}

Molly Hennessey-Fiske, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who has been covering proceedings against Durst, 71, after his mid-March arrest in Louisiana, received a letter purporting to have been written by the suspect in state prison. The letter, post-marked April 1st in Baton Rouge, specifically states that Durst 'said nothing about charges, crimes or trials' but rambles on about Durst's thoughts on life in southern California. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney, said that the letter looked like his client's handwriting. Murder suspect Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter, in which he mentions his taste for opera and pro football, to a Los Angeles Times reporter covering his case. Molly Hennessey-Fiske received the letter, which was addressed 'Hiya Holly' from a man purporting to be Robert Durst at a Louisiana state prison . Durst, who was arrested for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman last month, pleaded not guilty to weapons charges on Thursday. Above, he is escorted to prison after his arraignment on March 17 . Hennessey-Fiske, a veteran reporter for the West Coast newspaper, is the outlet's Houston bureau chief and has been covering Durst's legal proceeding . 'Bob is his own person and he’s writing letters to people. As long as they’re not discussing the facts or legal plans or strategy, I don’t have any problem with it,' Mr DeGuerin told The Los Angeles Times. Durst, who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family, was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend, writer Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. His letter to Hennessey-Fiske, her paper's Houston bureau chief, does not speak about on his impending extradition to California, but touches on various topics of conversation related to Los Angeles. In sloppy handwritten text with grammar mistakes, Durst spoke about places he lived in the city 'part-time' from 2008 to 2011. He said he 'hated LA traffic, which makes Houston look like a small town' before going on to say that his interests are 'opera and pro football'. Durst began the letter with an apparent mixing up of Hennesey-Fiske's first name by writing 'Hiya Holly'. Hiya Holly, . I used to read your biline, from 2008-2011 I lived part time in L.A., I had a great apt in 1100 Alta Loma and I had bought a great apt complex on Brynhurst. Sareb Kaufman was my broker. I loved watching the traffic come up La Cienaga and mush into Santa Monica, hated L.A. traffic which makes Houston seem like a small town. Used to breakfast at coffee whatever on Sunset. My interests are opera and pro football. Your politicos and business leaders have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree and there was no football. Like L.A. Opera except for Wagner's ring cycle with the absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk. As my minor balance prb. expanded to full blown hydrocephalus, requiring a shunt. I knew if I was going to let some guy drill into my head, there was no place I would be willing to go ahead other than the Houston Medical Center and I left L.A. I have said nothing about charges, crimes or trials. If you decide to used any of this, which is OK, please make the above clear. I am sure you know what your abilities are to visit me when I get to L.A., which is, if any of this gets published, please copy me . Bob . (Grammar and spelling errors throughout) Durst (right) was long thought to be involved in the murder of his friend and confidante Susan Berman (left) before his arrest. He is currently state and federal gun charges before being extradited to California . He blamed the lack of football in LA on 'politicos and business leaders' who 'have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree'. The suspect said that he liked the L.A. Opera, with the exception of 19th century German composer Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle, a 15-hour, three part show based on Norse legend. Durst said that he disliked the 'absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk'. The letter also gives information about the elderly man's health, and said that he moved from California to Texas to 'let some guy drill into my head' during surgery for what he says is hydrocephalus, water on the brain. Last year Durst had a shunt on the his head to drain water. Handwriting, including that on a 2000 letter to Beverly Hills Police informing them about the dead body of Susan Berman, is expected to play a part in the case against Durst for the murder of his friend . Evidence that came to light during the filming of HBO's The Jinx shows similar handwriting to the 'cadaver' letter on an envelope sent to Berman before her death (left). Right, another sample of his letter-writing . He also asked to be 'copied' if any of the information from his letter to Hennessey-Fiske was published. The millionaire, who gained $65 million from a court settlement with his family over his inheritance, was arrested in mid-March at a hotel in New Orleans after leaving his home in Houston. His life and criminal trials have gained more attention after he was the subject of an HBO documentary series called The Jinx, which delved into the Berman killing as well as two other deaths to which he is connected. Many observers think that the heir also played a role in the disappearance of his wife Kathleen McCormack in 1982 and have speculated that he killed his confidante Berman so that she did not reveal any information to police. He was found not guilty in 2003 of killing a man who was his neighbor at Galveston, Texas, house where Durst was living and pretending to be a mute woman named Dorothy Ciner. The HBO documentary series The Jinx delved into a letter Durst wrote to Berman obtained by the victim's stepson Sareb Kaufman . Durst, seen with The Jinx director Andrew Jarecki, willingly participated in the series, though he was later caught telling himself that he killed all the people he is accused of murdering . Durst admitted to chopping up the body of the Texas man, Morris Black, and dumping into Galveston Bay, but said the killing was in self-defense. The Jinx captured footage of Durst allegedly admitting to himself that he killed all three people while wearing a still-live microphone. 'Killed them all,' he said while in the bathroom after an interview. Durst was recently indicted on weapons charges for the revolver found in his New Orleans hotel room, a development that will most likely delay his extradition to California for the Berman trial. He is currently staying in the mental ward of state prison and is being held without bail. As a convicted felon he is barred from owning a gun in Louisiana, but pleaded not guilty to the charges on Thursday. He is also charged with having a gun while in possession of five ounces marijuana and faces up to 30 years in prison in addition to federal firearms charges. The arrest in the Berman case, in which Durst was long thought to have played a part, came after new evidence from the victim's stepson was shown as part of the HBO series. The final episode of the Jinx ran the day after Durst was arrested. Durst (right) is also thought to have been involved in the disappearance of his first wife Kathleen McCormack (right) and admitted to killing Morris Black (left) but said it was in self-defense . Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin (pictured in March) said that he does not mind his client sending letters from prison as long as they don't give away legal strategy . An episode also focused on a letter to Berman from Durst obtained by Berman's stepson Sareb Kaufman, where the handwriting matched a message to police alerting them of the writer's death. Initial Los Angeles Police investigations into the 'cadaver' letter believed that Berman's manager Nyle Brenner wrote the message, according to the New York Daily News. However the handwriting matches the letter from Kaufman, who is mentioned in Durst's recent letter to Hennessey-Fiske as his broker for an apartment deal, and contained the same spelling mistake of Beverly Hills as 'Beverley Hills'. Durst's lawyer Mr DeGuerin told the Los Angeles Times that the handwriting appeared authentic, but  'It certainly doesn’t look like the cadaver letter'. The similarities between Durst's previous correspondence and the anonymous letter sent to the Beverly Hills police is expected to play a role in his trial in California. Durst ends his letter to Hennessey-Fiske by saying that she is probably aware of her ability to visit him once he returns to Los Angeles."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1867, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "Alastair Cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor Graham Gooch but his technical problems very much remain. The England captain, without an international century for almost two years, failed for the second time in the first Test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by West Indies. To compound Cook’s misery, there was also another failure for Jonathan Trott, who has endured a nightmare return to the England team for his 50th Test, 18 months after the trauma of leaving the Ashes tour following his 49th. The double blow at the start of England’s second innings left them with much to do in this first Test to work their way towards a winning position at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium even though they earned a first-innings lead of 104. Cook simply cannot afford many more mistakes, with new ECB chairman Colin Graves demanding victory here over opposition in West Indies he condemned as ‘mediocre’ ahead of this trip. Cook returned to something like his best last year with three half-centuries in his last four Test innings against India but his woeful one-day form in Sri Lanka led England to jettisoning him as 50-over captain ahead of the World Cup. He arrived in the Caribbean still smarting from that blow but with a slightly altered technique and looked refreshed in scoring a warm-up hundred against St Kitts. The step up to Test level, however, has seen Cook struggling and Jerome Taylor looked anything but mediocre in sending both him and Trott back with just 20 on the board as England endured a rocky start to their second innings. Trott has been recalled in the unaccustomed role of opener but has looked jittery in scoring a duck and now four and was noticeably falling over in the crease as he edged a decent ball from Taylor to Denesh Ramdin. Alastair Cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first Test in Antigua . Jonathan Trott was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many . James Tredwell earlier picked up four wickets as England bowled West Indies out for 295 in their first innings . It is far too early to say that England’s gamble in bringing back a man who left Australia with what was later diagnosed as ‘situational anxiety’ has backfired but Trott will be under significant pressure in the second Test. Cook’s problems have been going on much longer and it is no exaggeration to say that he will be fighting for his job for the rest of this three-match series, particularly with change sweeping through English cricket. Here he pushed forward hesitantly to a ball he could have left alone from Taylor and succeeded only in edging to the delighted Sulieman Benn at slip on 13 after falling for 11 in the first innings. And when Ian Bell, a centurion in the first innings, was run out after a dreadful mix-up with Gary Balance, England had again lost early wickets and were struggling on 52 for three, only 156 ahead. West Indies were very much in the game then but Ballance and Joe Root settled any English nerves with an unbroken stand of 64 which gives them a lead of 220 and puts them in what should be a decisive position. Earlier England had toiled before dismissing West Indies for 295, with the unlikely figure of James Tredwell finishing with four for 47 but Jimmy Anderson only being able to claim one more victim to remain one short of Sir Ian Botham’s England record of 383 Test wickets. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was the first wicket to fall on day three as he was caught by Ben Stokes off Tredwell . Stuart Broad celebrates after claiming the wicket of Denesh Ramdin to leave West Indies on 227 for six . Jermaine Blackwood celebrates his maiden Test match century in his sixth Test match . Alastair Cook has now gone 61 combined Test and ODI innings without making a century. His last ton for England came against New Zealand at Headingley in May 2013, 690 days ago. England fought long and hard before they decided to bring Tredwell on this tour and considered Surrey’s Zafar Ansari and even his veteran team-mate Gareth Batty before they plumped for the likeable yeoman of Kent. Moeen Ali’s absence gave an opportunity to an off-spinner who could not even get into Kent’s championship team last season, the promise of Adam Riley being preferred to him, and Tredwell had to go on loan to Sussex to get a game. Yet Tredwell is reliable, steady and under-stated and England knew he would not let them down when they preferred him to the more naturally talented but inconsistent Adil Rashid for this first Test. The 23-year-old Jamaican scored 112 from 220 deliveries to drag West Indies up to 295 from their first innings . Blackwood takes off his helmet and raises his bat to celebrate a first century in international cricket . Joe Root makes the catch to dismiss Sulieman Benn, who was the last wicket to fall in West Indies' innings . Jermaine Blackwood is a 23-year-old Jamaican middle-order batsman playing in his sixth Test match. What kind of batsman is he? He’s a very aggressive player — he hit James Tredwell for six off his second ball of the innings — but perfectly capable of a well-worked innings. Blackwood has passed 50 four times in his first six Tests, including 56 and 63 against New Zealand and South Africa respectively, not to mention his unbeaten 112. Anything else I need to know? Tredwell isn’t the first Test bowler Blackwood has hit over the rope at the start of his innings. The batsman hit Trent Boult for four and six in his second over against New Zealand. It will be difficult for England to leave him out now, even though Moeen will join the squad in Grenada in time for the second Test, particularly if Tredwell can spin them to victory on this slow Antiguan pitch. It was Tredwell who made the first breakthrough of the day for England and the most important one in persuading the limpet-like Shiv Chanderpaul to chip tamely to extra cover in an off-side dominated field. That should have opened the door for England but they needed to be patient until the last three West Indians fell in 11 balls to a combination of Tredwell, Anderson and sharp work from Stuart Broad to run out Taylor. Throughout it all the diminutive figure of Jermaine Blackwood stood firm for West Indies to go to his maiden hundred in his sixth Test with thrilling but often risky stroke-making. Blackwood severely tried the patience of Ben Stokes, who could have had him three times but ended up wicketless as the 23-year-old Jamaican finished unbeaten on 112. Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott for just four after he edged behind to Ramdin . Trott added a score of four to his first innings duck in his first Test since returning after an 18 month absence . Trott makes his way off the field after a disappointing first Test back in the England team . Captain Cook also fell cheaply as he was out for 13 after edging a Taylor delivery into the slips . Ian Bell also lost his wicket late on the third evening as England's first three wickets fell for just 52 runs . Jimmy Anders on will have to wait until West Indies’ second innings to beat Ian Botham’s record Test wicket haul of 383. The Lancashire fast bowler took 2 for 67 in the first innings — after Devon Smith was caught behind on Tuesday, Anderson dismissed tail-ender Sulieman Benn with a length ball deflected to short leg. Benn was Anderson’s first wicket caught at short leg since New Zealand’s Iain O’Brien at Old Trafford in 2008 — his 78th Test wicket. It was Blackwood who was reprieved by Stokes overstepping on the second evening when he was caught at slip and it was the same man who survived when he was dropped by the diving Tredwell on 43 and then when he edged Stokes through the vacant second slip on 80. For Anderson this was another frustrating day, with little reverse swing on offer, but he did move a big step closer to the record when he had last man Benn caught by Root at short leg. Yet the ultimate English frustration belonged to Cook and Trott."}

Allardyce's side had been on track for their first back-to-back home wins in almost four months but having already had two goals ruled out for offside, Arnautovic eventually punished the fading hosts to earn a draw. Aaron Cresswell had given the home side an early lead at Upton Park but after a strong start it was Stoke who ended up dominating and they left with a deserved point.

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone including the move for Marko Arnautovic's 95th minute equaliser for Stoke City . It is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth-placed Hammers after draws at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and the defeat at Leicester City last week. Without the late goals they could be above Swansea City and sitting on a club-record 50 points. 'We can't find the right key elements to see that game out. We leave ourselves on a nervous edge,' Allardyce said. 'We are very nervous at that stage over what's happened before and we should be on 50 points now. We've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games. 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' West Ham's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against Stoke, and the reawakening coincided with the return of Enner Valencia. It was Stoke's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes. Glenn Whelan tripped Valencia five yards outside the penalty area to give West Ham an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball. Mark Noble looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper Asmir Begovic confused. Instead, unlikely scorer Cresswell was the chosen one and he sent the free-kick over the wall and curling into the Bosnian stopper's top left-hand corner to give West Ham the lead with his second goal of the season.

West Ham were well on top, and Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate could have added to the lead inside the opening 20 minutes. But as the half wore on it was Stoke who looked the more likely to score. Valencia's influence waned and instead it was Arnautovic who took control, dominating Cresswell down West Ham's left-hand side. Charlie Adam curled an ambitious free-kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before Jonathan Walters silenced an impatient Upton Park with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit Adrian's side netting. Victor Moses also had an opportunity, bringing down Arnautovic's cross inside the penalty area, spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide. Allardyce would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half-time unscathed and Stoke went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee Roger East blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners. A low-key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by Winston Reid gave Adam a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the Scot shot wide.

Minutes later Arnautovic had the ball in the net, slotting past Adrian, but his run was correctly flagged for offside. The Spanish keeper's goal seemed to be living a charmed life and particularly so as Stoke went within an inch of equalising. Jonathan Walters sent in a cross from the right that was met by the unmarked head of substitute Mame Biram Diouf, who powered an effort towards goal only to see it bounce off the inside of the post, along the goal line and somehow staying out. West Ham looked like throwing it all away again late on. Arnautovic found Adrian's net for a second time but was again flagged for offside. But the Austrian wasn't to be denied and he eventually scored with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. Stephen Ireland flicked the ball on and Arnautovic applied the finish, slipping the ball into the corner to leave a familiar scene for the home support. Stoke manager Mark Hughes said: 'It looked for a long time that we weren't going to be able to do it.

Deep in injury time, with Blackburn’s FA Cup journey about to end, Simon Eastwood appeared for a corner and found the ball at his feet as it dropped from a jumble of players 12 yards out. Eastwood, oddly, had time and, even more strangely given the melee in the area, he had space, too. He had the whole goal to aim at. He should have scored. As it happened, his right-foot shot on the turn was struck well enough but it was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who managed to parry the ball and then grab it as it threatened to spin over the line. We do not blame Eastwood, of course. He is a goalkeeper. But he will wake this morning knowing that a peculiar and romantic part in FA Cup folklore could have been his. Liverpool celebrated a place in the FA Cup semi-finals after beating Blackburn, setting up a Wembley encounter with Aston Villa .

They were losing 1-0 at the time and a goal so late on would only have taken them in to extra-time. Nevertheless, Liverpool will go on to a semi-final date with Aston Villa knowing that they were almost part of one of the great cup stories — and not in a good way. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer had looked ready to celebrate the unlikeliest of goals. He said: ‘I think it was more shock that he managed to do that and turn. It was an unbelievable turn from him, a last roll of the dice. To have pushed Liverpool like that over two games and still have a chance like that means there’s nothing but praise for my players.’ Over the course of the piece, Liverpool deserved their win. They were not wholly convincing and will need to improve markedly if they are to win this competition or make another desperate late dart towards the Champions League places. Nevertheless, they dominated the majority of the possession and defended manfully when they had to. Without their two best defenders — the suspended pair Emre Can and Martin Skrtel — Liverpool reverted to a back four and then lost Mamadou Sakho to injury. However, the makeshift pair of Dejan Lovren and Kolo Toure stepped up and deserve credit. Toure was wretched in the Barclays Premier League defeat at Arsenal at the weekend but was excellent here. At times, experience counts for much. So does timing, of course, and Philippe Countinho’s was excellent on Wednesday. With 20 minutes to go, this was a game that looked as though it may be about to swing towards Blackburn.

Reading vs Arsenal . Sat 18 April, 5.20pm . Aston Villa vs Liverpool . Sunday 19 April, 3pm . (Both ties to be played at Wembley) Having just thrown on their big forward Rudy Gestede — a player who had caused Liverpool so much trouble in the first game a month ago — the Championship team were beginning to seriously trouble their opponents. Within a minute of his arrival, Gestede outmuscled Jordan Henderson in the middle of the field and released Tom Cairney, who had to be tackled desperately by Toure. Then, from the ensuing corner, Mignolet was forced to come and palm the ball away rather desperately under pressure. For Bowyer and his team, it looked as though the perfect storm was brewing. Liverpool had enjoyed huge swathes of possession but had most of their approach play floundered against Blackburn’s defensive barricades manned by the exceptional Matt Kilgallon and Alex Baptiste. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet makes a save onto the post to deny Marshall giving Blackburn the lead . Blackburn's Tom Cairney is clipped by Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno after evading the Spaniard's challenge . Now, with the last quarter of the game upon them, Blackburn were scenting blood only for Coutinho to draw their sting with one of the few moments of stardust quality Liverpool managed all night. Seeing a 70th minute corner come back to him from a defender, Coutinho had the awareness to lay the ball off to Henderson and then make a move towards the return. It was this that created the space and the rest — the control and shot across goal in to the corner — was down purely to confidence, touch and purpose. These three qualities had been missing from much of Liverpool’s play. Daniel Sturridge, for example, was wretched. For him every second touch was a tackle and young Raheem Sterling did not do an awful lot better. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder  Coutinho tries to unlock the Blackburn defence as Kilgallon stands him up . Toure watches on after Blackburn goalkeeper Eastwood makes a save during the first half at Ewood Park . Jordan Rhodes attempts a shot at goal in the second half, but it was blocked by Liverpool defender Toure . Liverpool goalkeeper Mignolet punches the ball clear as Blackburn's Rudy Gestede attempts to head the ball . Liverpool, though, do have players of high class and when people like Coutinho are around the keys to the jail cell are never far from reach. Afterwards, Blackburn manager Bowyer did have a complaint to make. At the start of the second half, Mignolet made a diving save from Cairney and then, from the corner, an even better one from a Ben Marshall header. Replays showed that the ball may have brushed Joe Allen’s arm before it reached the Liverpool goalkeeper. If it did, though, it did not deviate. There is no way that referee Kevin Friend could have spotted it. It would have taken cricket’s Hot Spot to reveal the thinnest of outside edges and as such it was hard to feel too much empathy with Bowyer. Cairney steps away from a challenge from Liverpool midfielder  Allen during the quarter-final replay . Liverpool manager Rodgers and Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer talk in the technical area . Ewood Park was sold out for the quarter-final replay after the initial tie at Anfield last month ended goalless . On the whole, his team were excellent. So, too, were the home crowd who have rather criminally been deprived of nights like this since their club’s ownership changed hands four-and-half years ago. Just as they did in the first game, Blackburn struggled for prolonged possession but still scared Liverpool at times. Jordan Rhodes, for example, should have scored with a header in the first half. Liverpool, for their part, lived on half chances. They are not fluent at the moment. They are in the last four, though. Had the goalkeeper taken better aim, it may have been different."}

She is also co-chairman of Reading Football Club with Madejski. Lady Sasima Srivikorn is in her 70s with an endearing laugh and a royal blue scarf she has knitted especially for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Wembley. Like 73-year-old Madejski, Lady Sasima is something of an eccentric. Educated at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama in the 1950s, she has been a singer and composer who wrote the theme song for the Asian Games. 'It was called Reach For The Stars,' she says proudly before talking enthusiastically about her involvement with the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and her autobiography, A Life By Chance. Reading co-owners Lady Sasima Srivikorn and Sir John Madejski spoke to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton . The Championship club will swap the Madejski Stadium for Wembley on Saturday in the FA Cup semi-final . But then she offers a chilling insight into what it is to be one of Thailand's most powerful women, a super-rich Harvard Business School graduate who became the first female on the Thai Airways board. Madejski listens intently as the woman he credits with rescuing Reading last September talks about the night in 2014 when three men armed with M16 automatic weapons fired on her house in north-east Thailand. She believes the incident was provoked by the political activities of her daughter and son-in-law. The previous day they had instigated a peaceful public demonstration after seeing the former wife of Thaksin Shinawatra — ex-Thai prime minister and one-time owner of Manchester City — in a Bangkok shopping mall. Shinawatra was removed from power in 2006 in a military coup after allegations of corruption. Jamie Mackie celebrates after scoring Reading's third goal against Bradford to secure their victory . Reading beat Bradford 3-0 in a quarter-final reply at the Madejski to secure their Wembley semi-final . Lady Sasima says her daughter was still angry about the corruption, explaining: 'The next day I am with friends at my house. We had been playing cards until about 2am. We had just gone to bed. And I had 100 bullets from an M16 shot at my house. 'They didn't mean to kill. They just wanted to scare, to threaten, but bullets hit my bathroom. The windows in my bedroom.' Presumably she now goes everywhere under armed guard? 'No,' she says. 'There's no use having security. If someone really wants to kill me, they can kill me any time. It's funny, when I realised it was a machine gun I thought it was the moment when I was about to die but I was very calm, not frightened at all.' 'This is one hell of a wise lady — and very modest too,' says Madejski admiringly. When I first saw Lady Sasima at the hotel at the Madejski Stadium, she was seated at the head of a table having breakfast with five Thai gentlemen. One was Pairoj Piempongsant, who brokered the deal when Shinawatra bought City in 2007 and is now senior adviser to the four-strong Thai consortium that purchased Reading last year. 'In business I'm probably more comfortable with men. I find them more straight-forward,' she explains now she is in the Lady Sasima Suite that boasts a perfect view of the pitch. Reading players mob goalscorer Garath McCleary during their 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Bradford . Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives the lowdown on Reading's players to watch ahead of the Arsenal match . 'The people you saw me having breakfast with are involved in politics. And you may have recognised Pairoj Piempongsant. He is a very nice man who has the knowledge and contacts we need.' As the owner of a 25 per cent stake in Reading, Lady Sasima is clearly not about to let Piempongsant run the show, however. 'I started in business when I was 25,' she says. 'My late husband's parents passed away and we had some money. We started with a school — which one of my daughters now runs — and then we had a hotel — but my biggest passion is land. I like real estate. I like to create things. It allows me to use my imagination.' She appears to be thinking along these lines with Reading. The consortium has already invested heavily in the club's academy, building 13 pitches. She says she is also in discussion with Reading Council and talks of a vision of 'a second London' along the M4 corridor. 'I love this town,' she says. For Reading FC the longer-term vision is clear. A club that has twice before been promoted to the Barclays Premier League want to return under manager Steve Clarke. 'That is the ambition,' she says and Madejski nods in agreement. Arsenal, pictured in training on Friday, will provide a tough test for Steve Clarke's Reading on Saturday . Madejski and Lady Sasima pose for a photo at the Madejski Stadium during their chat with Sportsmail . Madejski sees the Thai consortium as Reading's saviours, given the financial difficulties the club endured after selling to Anton Zingarevich. The cash the Russian was expected to invest when he bought Reading in 2012 never materialised and after a period Madejski described as the 'most stressful of my life', Lady Sasima and her colleagues stepped in. 'They have been like a breath of fresh air. I can't tell you how excited I am about the future,' he says. By his own admission Madejski needed to sell. He did a remarkable job with his hometown club, building the stadium as well as overseeing their rise to the top flight for the first time. But reports have suggested he lost the best part of £300million between 2008 and 2014 and he does not deny it. 'I'm not sure it was quite that much,' he says, 'but I lost a heck of a lot of dosh.' 'Not on football?' Lady Sasima asks, a little nervously. 'No, no,' says Madejski, with a laugh. 'An entrepreneur's life is cyclical. I'm just pleased we can now look forward in a positive way.' Reading man Hal Robson-Kanu battles with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman in the Royals' last game . Lady Sasima and Madejski are excited about Saturday and have a long-term ambition to get to the top flight . When it comes to Saturday evening's match, Reading's first FA Cup semi-final since 1927, this pair of septuagenarians — possibly the oddest couple in sport — are giddy with excitement. Lady Sasima talks of the 'honour' of playing Arsenal and the thrill of taking family, friends and business associates to Wembley. A man who has been defined by triumph over adversity, Madejski loves the fact that his team are underdogs. In 12 previous attempts they have never beaten Arsenal. Madejski talks movingly about being in foster care after his mother was ostracised by her family for a wartime fling that led to his arrival. 'Being illegitimate wasn't the most ennobling start,' he says. 'I feel sorry for my mother. She never really got over the fact of me. The pair are desperate to take their club back to the promised land of the Premier League . Reading boss Clarke has a tough test to come through on Saturday when his side face Arsenal at Wembley . 'I found out who my father was only 10 years ago. I never met him but his name was William Adshead. Quite ironic really when you think I became an \"ads head\" with the Auto Trader business. He was from Liverpool which is probably why I get on well with Cilla Black.' Now Lady Sasima is the one listening intently. 'I didn't know Sir John's story until after we bought the club,' she says, 'but he is a real gentleman. When my sons heard about me buying Reading they were all shocked. The first question they asked me was \"where is your business model?\" 'I said there isn't one. I don't think there can be in football. You just have to be passionate, dedicated and perhaps lucky. 'Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Everyone asks why? Why football? Why now? But you have this team that wins and loses. It's woken me up. Made me feel more alert.' Madejski gives her a squeeze. 'And it's fun,' he says."}

England quick James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . MICHAEL BROWN . Burnley CC team-mate, now club chairman . We used to call Jimmy the ‘Pro Killer’. Playing in the Lancashire League, he’d regularly get the opposition professional out. He was quite a slight kid. It was probably when he was 17 that we thought, wow, he’s got some pace. And he had this ability to bowl jaffas. When he bowled so brilliantly against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup everyone at Burnley was saying: ‘We’ve seen these magic balls before.’ Anderson was known as Pro Killer during his days with Burnley, reveals former team-mate and now club chairman Michael Brown . My mum can take some of the credit for Jimmy being signed by Lancashire. He was bowling really well for Burnley, and she rang up John Stanworth, who was at the club at the time. Jimmy was invited for trials by Lancashire and that was that. He was always a shy lad. But he cares very much. JOHN STANWORTH . Former Lancashire player development manager . His potential was brought to my attention by Val Brown so I’m not going to take credit for unearthing Jimmy. I didn’t necessarily think he’d be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him. When he arrived for Under 17 nets he was a shy introvert but with the ability to bowl at good pace. But it was the late swing that stood out. Even established batsmen struggled to line him up. They were playing and missing all the time. He made them look ordinary. In the early days I just left him alone. He had these unusual mannerisms, like not looking at the batsman at the point of delivery, and a strange rotation of the shoulders. But I ignored all that even when coaches at other counties were pointing it out. I just said: ‘We’ve got a 17-year-old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out!’ WARREN HEGG . Anderson’s first captain at Lancashire and wicketkeeper . He burst on to the scene in my first year as captain. There was talk of this kid from the valleys in Lancashire. He wouldn’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light with the funniest action. He bowled to me in a centre net practice at Old Trafford and was either turning me inside out or hitting me on the shin. I thought: ‘Either I’m losing it or this kid’s special’. And he really was. We sat down with coach Mike Watkinson and tried to work out how to set fields that were both attacking and defensive at the same time in case he sent down the odd poor ball. So we’d have three slips, a gully and a deep point. It gave him confidence to concentrate on how to be a fast bowler. He went from strength to strength. Anderson (back row second from left) 'wouldn’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light,' says his 2002 Lancashire captain Warren Hegg (front row fifth from left) He was a keeper’s dream. He was in the high-80s and took the ball away so I always thought I was going to get a nick. That said, he was partly responsible for ending my career a few games early. He bowled James Middlebrook down at Chelmsford and I dislocated a thumb after the ball ricocheted off the bails. But I could console myself with the thought that I’d kept to England’s best. MIKE WATKINSON . Anderson’s first coach at Lancashire . I was coaching the Lancashire second team when Jimmy arrived. He had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent. Some would swing, others wouldn’t. I’d been a swing bowler myself before changing to spin and I did some work with him before one game at Middleton. I tried to convey to him the importance of the relationship between the ball and the fingertips. He related to it straight away. Since then, he’s worked things out for himself. Jimmy’s been his own best coach. IAN WARD . Anderson’s first first-class victim: Lancashire v Surrey, Old Trafford, May 31, 2002 . He was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet. His run-up was the same. I just remember him being quality. He had this very fast arm which was difficult to pick up at first. To me, a left-hander, it was an awayswinger. I remember getting one that was too good for me and edged it to Warren Hegg. Sky Sports commentator Ian Ward (left with Shane Warne) was Jimmy's first first-class victim . I thought ‘Christ, this guy can bowl!’ In those days Lancashire had Peter Martin and Glen Chapple and we weren’t expecting them to go on forever. We thought, they’ve found another one already. That was the talk in the Surrey dressing-room. And when he got Ramps in the second innings you could see he had something different. MARK RAMPRAKASH . Dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match . I faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump. But they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper’s gloves quite hard. He was swinging it and getting it through at a good lick. Mark Ramprakash, now England batting coach, was dismissed LBW with the first ball of the second innings . In the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball. It was fast and swinging in and it hit me plumb in front. I was beaten for pace and a little bit of inswing, or maybe reverse. It was a terrific delivery. You tend to remember when a young man comes in and does that straight away. It raised a few eyebrows. At the Old Trafford Test against India last summer I was sitting on the team balcony as batting coach and I couldn’t remember a better exhibition of swing bowling. To witness that live was amazing. NASSER HUSSAIN . Anderson’s first England captain, in 2002-03 . He came into the team after yet another Ashes disaster. He was a breath of fresh air, a natural talent - very un-English! He wasn’t over-coached or too technical. He just ran in and bowled swing. He was the kind of player you might get from Pakistan. Anderson and his first England captain Nasser Hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 World Cup . For such a young lad, he wasn’t someone you needed to over-manage or look after. He was incredibly quiet but he knew exactly what he wanted to do. If anything I probably had such a good impression of him that I gave him more responsibility than I should have done - like bowling him instead of Andrew Caddick at the end of our World Cup game against Australia at Port Elizabeth in 2003. He got hit for six and I apologised to him later. He was playing pool, shrugged his shoulders, and got on with his game. But I knew he was going to be one of our greats. It’s one thing being a swing bowler but it’s the way he could get it to go so late. I faced him just once and he got me first ball at Old Trafford as part of a hat-trick. He’s a very clever cricketer. MARK BUTCHER . Man of the match on Anderson’s Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord’s in 2003 . Anderson celebrates the wicket of Zimbabwe's Travis Friend with Michael Vaughan (right) and Robert Key (left) during his debut Test at Lord's in May 2003, in which Mark Butcher claimed five wickets and man of the match . Like Jimmy, I took five wickets in that game. I like to think I taught him everything he knows about swing bowling. This was the first time I’d seen him close up. He swung it both ways and at serious pace. I thought, we’ve found one here. I took a catch off him. Andy Bignaut was trying to work one through square-leg but he nicked it to slip. It was a cracking delivery. It’s an easy thing to do when you’re new to get your bouncer through quickly, then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length. But his full balls were coming out at a good pace too. He was brilliant."}

So too, indirectly, for Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. Lahm's tackle on a team-mate at Bayern Munich's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough, until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble. As players milled round him, and a physio inspected the damage, the call went out for expert medical help. There wasn't any. To the dismay of Pep Guardiola, there wasn't a single qualified doctor on site. Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt quit this week after a reported rift with Pep Guardiola . The pair fell out over an injury to Philipp Lahm during training as early as November last year . As Lahm lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle, the physio tended to him as best he could, while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital. Muller-Wohlfahrt, meanwhile, was at his city centre clinic, nearly eight miles away. It was last November, and from that day on, the 72-year-old's days as head of Bayern's medical department were numbered. They finally ended after Bayern's Champions' League defeat at Porto, when Guardiola went public with his displeasure over recovery rates for injured players by blaming a lengthening injury list for his side's quarter-final first-leg demise. It was more than the world-renowned specialist could stomach, and he promptly walked away from the Bundesliga champions for a second time, taking the rest of his staff with him. He quit in high dudgeon once before, after a fall-out with Jurgen Klinsmann, but there will be no coming back this time. Not as long as Guardiola holds the reins. And that may just be for quite a while yet. The Bayern boss is aware Manchester City long to install him as replacement for Manuel Pellegrini, even if it means waiting another 12 months for his contract to expire, but the latest ructions at The Allianz Arena have evidently done nothing to increase their chances. Bayern  doctor Muller-Wohlfahrt is a world-renowned specialist and quit after Guardiola's injury complaints . The 72-year-old had been at Bayern for almost 40 years but is now unlikely to return to the Bundesliga club . Unseemly though his undermining of Muller-Wohlfahrt may have been, there was only ever going to be one winner. And, by all accounts, when his hand was raised in triumph, it strengthened his hold on power like never before. Dispiritingly for City, the former Barcelona manager reaffirmed, at his Friday press conference, that he will 'for sure' honour the remaining year on his contract, ruling out any hope of a deal being struck with Etihad bosses this summer. Beyond that, he could even commit himself to a further spell in charge, according to a Bayern insider, who told Sportsmail: 'There is no question that Bayern will do absolutely everything in their power to persuade Guardiola to sign another contract. 'There will be negotiations after the season is finished, and there is an air of confidence within the club that he will agree. It is far from certain, but, interestingly, the departure of Muller-Wohlfahrt makes it more probable, rather than less so. Muller-Wohlfahrt (fourth from left) sits behind Pep Guardiola during the defeat by Porto this week . Manchester City long to bring in Guardiola to replace Manuel Pellegrini but they may have to wait for him . 'That was a problem, because they had many disagreements over the treatment of injured players. Now he has gone, Guardiola is in a stronger position than ever. That is clear, because when Muller- Wohlfahrt said he was leaving, the club made no attempt to talk him out of it. They simply accepted it and said thanks very much. 'Pep has got his own way again, and that could play a part when they sit down in the summer to discuss a new deal.' So what went wrong between them? How could it be that a vastly- experienced and hugely-respected surgeon with a track record for rescuing stellar careers imperilled by injury failed to meet Guardiola's requirements as club doctor? Certainly, availability was a major issue. Sportsmail has learned that one of Guardiola's stipulations, after taking over from Jupp Heynckes, was that the club doctor should be at the training ground every single time the players were there. Dante, Sebastian Rode, Lahm and Robert Lewandowski (L-R) trudge off the pitch after defeat in Porto . Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt . Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods. He claims that a substance called Hyalart, which is extracted from the crest of cockerels, helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain. He also swears by Actovegin, an amino acid preparation derived from calves' blood. In 2009, he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat's blood to St Johnstone striker Peter MacDonald for his hamstring injury. Among those to have been treated by him are Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Michael Owen and Jose Maria Olazabal. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims to have administered more than one million injections, at least half of which have been to athletes. A stickler for detail, he wanted to ensure any mishap could be dealt with expertly at a moment's notice and made it clear it was an instruction to be adhered to by Muller-Wohlfahrt. It placed club bosses in a quandary, not for the last time, as Muller-Wohlfahrt pointed out he had a steady stream of high-profile patients to his city centre practice, not least the likes of Usain Bolt, and that he could ill-afford to desert his post to spend day after day at the club's training facility. Irked by Muller-Wohlfahrt's defiance, it soon became apparent to Guardiola that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury. In a nutshell, Guardiola wanted players declared fit and pencilled in for selection as rapidly as possible, whereas care and caution were the key words for Muller-Wohlfahrt. It drove Guardiola to distraction, according to the club insider, who said: 'Pep has never been the most patient about players' recovery time. If there is an injury, he expects it to clear up. He wants the players back on the pitch, but it wasn't happening. 'Muller-Wohlfahrt is the opposite. He takes the view that you have to be patient and allow the healing process to take its course. He wants a player to be in perfect condition when he returns and argues that rushing people back runs the risk of a fresh injury. Really, it's no wonder they were at loggerheads.' Guardiola wanted players declared fit as rapidly as possible, but Muller-Wohlfahrt wanted care and caution . Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. As a further insight into the core differences between the pair, Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a specific course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. The midfielder suffered damage to the same area of his knee three times in quick succession, and Muller-Wohlfahrt was adamant he should attend the veteran medic's clinic in Colorado for specialised treatment. Guardiola was having none of it and, instead, arranged for Thiago to undergo treatment in Barcelona, where, to Muller-Wohlfahrt's exasperation, surgery was followed by recuperation and an eventual return to the Bayern squad. Usain Bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from Muller-Wohlfahrt's treatment at the London Olympics . Guardiola is now in the strongest position he has ever been at Bayern and he could agree a new deal there . If protesting to the Bayern boss was futile, trying to appeal to Thiago was just as pointless. His agent is none other than Guardiola's brother, Pere. The odds were stacked ever-higher against Muller-Wohlfahrt, and his resignation on Friday morning was merely confirmation the Guardiola empire is not about to be overthrown. City must now wait to see if the Spaniard's Bavarian rule is about to be extended, as forecast with growing confidence in Munich circles."}

The likes of Morgan Schneiderlin, Yannick Bolasie and Nathaniel Clyne are wanted men as Champions League heavyweights like Arsenal and Manchester United circle like vultures. Sportsmail looks at 10 players who could be taking a ‘step up’ this summer. MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN (Southampton) Wanted by: Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea Valued at: £25m . Destined to be the most wanted player of the summer after an excellent season in midfield for Southampton. Arsene Wenger has long seen the Frenchman as an ideal holding player for Arsenal while Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino worked with him at St Mary's. Now Jose Mourinho is joining the chase, believing a Nemanja Matic-Schneiderlin axis will help Chelsea conquer Europe. Morgan Schneiderlin has shown this season that he is good enough to play Champions League football . Southampton convinced Schneiderlin to stay at the club last summer, but he is now ready to leave . Southampton dug in a year ago to persuade Schneiderlin to stay on the south coast but it is going to be virtually impossible to keep him again given that the 25-year-old has been putting in Champions League-standard performances all season and is coming into his prime. DANNY INGS (Burnley) Wanted by: Liverpool, Manchester United Valued at: £5m (compensation) The England Under 21 striker is out of contract in the summer and has no intention of staying at Turf Moor regardless of whether Burnley keep their Premier League status. Financially, he would make an excellent acquisition for a top club given the compensation for a Bosman would only be around a third of his true market value. Liverpool are interested - to sign a striker who turns 23 in July and who has scored nine Premier League goals this season, without having to pay a hefty transfer fee, is a no-brainer for the moneyball approach. But they face competition from United. Danny Ings is out of contract this summer and his scoring exploits have made him a target for top clubs . Burnley are resigned to losing Ings on a free and will only receive a modest compensation fee for him . NATHANIEL CLYNE (Southampton) Wanted by: Manchester United Valued at: £17m . After a season in which he made his England debut, 24-year-old Clyne is destined to follow his former Crystal Palace team-mate Wilfried Zaha to Old Trafford – but is fully expected to enjoy more success. The right back, who once helped Championship club Palace win a League Cup match at United, has been one of the revelations of the season at St Mary's this season and made it clear he won't enter talks about a new contract. Louis van Gaal has made a right back a priority this summer and Clyne is the red-hot favourite. Louis van Gaal has made Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne his top priority this summer . Clyne's impressive form for Southampton has earned him a regular spot in the England team . AARON CRESSWELL (West Ham) Wanted by: Manchester City, Chelsea Valued at: £12m . Arrived in the Premier League via Tranmere Rovers and Ipswich Town, and the left back's performances for West Ham have alerted both Manchester City and Chelsea, who need strengthening in that position and are both short of homegrown players. Liverpudlian Cresswell, 25, has been an ever-present for West Ham this season and even though he signed a new contract last summer, the London club are willing to extend it to 2020. Aaron Cresswell scored a superb free-kick against Stoke City last weekend to raise his market value . Manchester City and Chelsea are interested in the defender, but West Ham are hopeful he will stay . YANNICK BOLASIE (Crystal Palace) Wanted by: Liverpool Valued at: £10m . The 25-year-old winger has been one of the surprise breakthrough players of the season with a hat-trick at Sunderland last weekend answering the call from manager Alan Pardew for more goals to go alongside his undoubted ability. Bolasie, a DR Congo international, is one of the most naturally gifted and unpredictable players in the division and a major reason Palace are now an established force in the top flight. Liverpool and Spurs like to play with width and both need a player who is comfortable on the left-hand side. Yannick Bolasie has been in superb form for Crystal Palace this season and could be a target . Bolasie celebrates after netting a hat-trick against Sunderland and he is wanted by Liverpool in the summer . CHARLIE AUSTIN (QPR) Wanted by: Liverpool, Tottenham Valued at: £10m . Austin has been outstanding in a struggling side and his tally of 17 Premier League goals is the fourth-best in the division and only two behind Diego Costa, Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane who are with clubs at the other end of the table. It seems inevitable Austin will move on should Rangers get relegated. Liverpool need a natural goalscorer with Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli set to leave in the summer while Spurs don't want to be over-reliant on Kane. Charlie Austin is only a couple of goals short of the league's leading scorers and is a target for Liverpool . Spurs are also interested in the English striker as they look for a partner for Harry Kane up front . SAIDO BERAHINO (West Brom) Wanted by: Tottenham Valued at: £15m . The England Under 21 striker has made headlines for the wrong reasons this season and received a 12-month driving ban in January after being convicted of drink-driving. On the pitch, his 18 goals in all competitions have underlined his goalscoring potential and Spurs have taken note. West Brom's early valuation of around £25m appears overly optimistic but if the Baggies decide to be more realistic in negotiations, there is every chance he could fulfil his dream of moving to a bigger club. Saido Berahino has scored 18 times this season although his off-field actions have caused controversy . AYOZE PEREZ (Newcastle United) Wanted by: Arsenal, Manchester United Valued at: £12m . Newcastle's scouting system came up trumps when they paid £1m to Tenerife for the little-known forward in August. Since then, Perez has displayed some of the quickest feet seen in the Premier League and scored five goals, including the winner against Liverpool. At 21, Perez is far from the finished article but Arsene Wenger and Louis van Gaal have spotted his potential, particularly as this is his debut season in England. Ayoze Perez has impressed since joining Newcastle for a small fee last summer and could move on again . ROSS BARKLEY (Everton) Wanted by: Manchester City Valued at: £40m . It may be harsh for Everton fans for their club not to be included as a 'big club' but that's the reality when it comes to young international players like Barkley; they are in the bottom half of the table and have sold the likes of Wayne Rooney, Joleon Lescott and Marouane Fellaini in their prime. Barkley has been compared with Paul Gascoigne for his ability to dribble and hold defenders off. This has been a difficult season by his standards but Manchester City, always on the lookout for the best homegrown players, believe he has the ability to go all the way. Ross Barkley may not have had the best of seasons but he is still a target for some of the league's top sides . Barkley has retained his England place, and would be a key signing for clubs short of homegrown talent . JACK GREALISH (Aston Villa) Wanted by: Chelsea, Manchester City Valued at: £15m . The teenage midfielder signed a four-year deal at Villa earlier this season so it would take a big push by Chelsea or City to prise him away this summer. Nonetheless, a stand-out performance by Grealish in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool could persuade them. If Barkley gets by defenders with strength and strong running, the nimble-footed Grealish seems to escape his markers in the tightest of spaces. If comparing him with Lionel Messi is a bit exaggerated, think Middlesbrough's former Brazilian player, Juninho. Jack Grealish has broken through this season at Aston Villa and is wanted by Chelsea and Manchester City ."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 2018, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "The collapse in Roberto Mancini's relationship with Manchester City was rooted in his dismay at the quality of English players signed by the club. When names like Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and to a lesser extent Adam Johnson were signed, he could barely disguise his contempt, feeling none of them would help him take on Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League. 'Ask Marwood,' he would spit out when asked about the club's transfer policy, referring to the club's then-football administrator Brian Marwood who was responsible at the time for buying players. Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been linked with a move to Manchester City . Mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on, Marwood has a new role at the academy with a Spaniard, Txiki Begiristain, in his old job with the title director of football. And yet the dilemma remains the same: How do City buy enough top English players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking FPP (financial fair play) regulations again? It won't be easy and could explain why City – who have slumped to fourth in the league – are being linked with less glamorous names like Danny Rose and Aaron Cresswell. Good players certainly, but good enough? Probably not. It's a sobering thought that Rodwell made only seven Premier League starts in two seasons for City after a £12million move from Everton. Sinclair started just twice after signing from Swansea and is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Plenty of things at City have been carefully planned and executed well since the club's owners from Abu Dhabi took over in 2008. (From left) Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, assistant manager Brian Kidd, manager Manuel Pellegrini and former football administrator Brian Marwood . The Etihad Campus is a glittering monument to football development and helping the community, while two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup is an excellent trophy haul considering where the club have come from. But one weakness has been in their approach to having enough homegrown players, lagging behind most of their rivals. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers and Manchester United bought Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw as teenagers. Most spectacularly, Liverpool bought players like Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling and invested in making them better. Spurs have brought through Harry Kane and Ryan Mason from their academy. Only Chelsea face similar issues to City. Homegrown rules are complicated and differ slightly between competitions. Scott Sinclair (left) and Jack Rodwell are two English players who were bought by Manchester City . In the Premier League, you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25. Homegrown players can be born overseas as long as they have been at a club's academy three years before the age of 21. If clubs can't find eight, they have to reduce their squad accordingly, as Chelsea have had to this season. Under 21 players can be named in the squad in addition to the 25. City's six Premier League homegrown players are: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner and there lies a major problem for next season. Lampard is definitely off and Milner is out of contract too. Clichy has endured a poor season and City will want a new left-back while Boyata, a Belgian who has been at City since he was 16, is not good enough to win a regular first-team place. The feeling is he was only offered his latest contract because he filled one of the homegrown slots. Ditto, third-choice goalkeeper Wright. Manchester United signed both Wayne Rooney (left) and Luke Shaw as teenagers . The Champions League squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in England, but four of those must have come through the ranks at City. Boyata was their only club-trained player named this season. It will be a major problem for the club next season as their one-season punishment (for breaching FFP rules) to name a squad of 21 is lifted and they can name 25 again. These will be issues exercising the minds at the very top of the club. But whichever way they look at it, City have three options which carry a downside: . 1) Spend big on the best English players 2) Find their own from their academy or 3) Buy cheaper English players who might not be good enough. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Jordan Henderson are two players Liverpool bought to boost their English quota . For option one, supply and demand is a problem. There are probably only three England players most people would call good international-class and therefore worthy of a place in the City team should they want to win titles at home and abroad. Hart is already there, Wayne Rooney is at Manchester United and presumably unattainable while Raheem Sterling would be a premium price. 'Can you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with £100million you can,' complained Manuel Pellegrini recently. No wonder City appear ready to open negotiations at £50m. Kean Bryan is one of the young players at Manchester City who is tipped to go on to big things . Midfielder Kean Bryan ticks all the boxes for what Manchester City hope to achieve in the future. A box-to-box midfielder from Manchester, he joined City at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an England youth international at different age levels. Aged 18, he has played for Patrick Vieira's under-21 elite development squad this season, and played five matches in City's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League, a Champions League equivalent for under-20s. Been compared to Steven Gerrard. The last Mancunian to play regularly for City was Michael Johnson and he had to retire early after injury problems. Of the next generation, £60m has been quoted for Everton's Ross Barkley, a huge price for unproven talent. Harry Kane would be an interesting target as would Everton's Under21 defender John Stones, who might represent the best value-for-money. Jack Wilshere has had injury problems. City's academy cost £200m but so far none has broken into the first-team squad regularly. Marcos Lopes is on loan at Lille and may move there permanently. Karim Rekik has played Champions League football for PSV. City will hope starlets like Jose Pozo, Thierry Ambrose, Mathias Bossaerts, Seko Fofana, Jason Denayer and Kean Bryan will become their homegrown first-teamers of the future, but they are unlikely to make a major contribution next season. Bryan is novel and interesting, he is from Manchester and has been likened to Steven Gerrard. Ross Barkley is one of the most hotly tipped players in England and worth in the region of £60m . The third option is to try and sign any English Premier League player who is available. It might not be the best idea for the players themselves, Johnson said after he was sold to Sunderland that the move to City can turn sour for young players. 'It is a lot different when you don't play. The novelty wears off, definitely,' he said. Rodwell is now at Sunderland too, while Sinclair will make his loan move to Aston Villa permanent provided they stay up. Rose and Cresswell be warned. Making up the numbers at Manchester City doesn't necessarily help the player or club. PREMIER LEAGUE . Eight players in the 25-man squads must be homegrown. A player counts as homegrown if they have spent three years at an English club up to the age of 21. Squads can be supplemented by as many Under 21 players as clubs want. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Eight of the 25-man squad must be homegrown, four of whom must be club-trained ie have come through the ranks of the actual club they are playing for. Squads can be supplemented by Under-21 players provided they have been with the club for at least two years. SERIE A . From 2016, squads will be limited to 25 players (not counting Under 21s), four of whom have to have grown up in Italy and four of whom have to be products of their club's academy, similar to Champions League rules. Clubs are not allowed to sign more than two non-EU players in a season. LA LIGA . Clubs are not allowed more than three non-EU players in their squads of 25, or in matches. However, after five years, you can apply for Spanish citizenship and become an EU player, as Lionel Messi has done. There are no additional homegrown rules for EU players. BUNDESLIGA . Clubs need to include eight homegrown players, including four from their own youth academy, in their squad. But unlike the Premier League, squads aren't restricted to 25 players so they can still sign as many non-homegrown players as they like. There are no restrictions on signing non-EU players. MANCHESTER CITY . Association-trained homegrown players: Joe Hart, Richard Wright, Gael Clichy, James Milner, Frank Lampard. Club-trained homegrown player: Dedryck Boyata ."}

The Crystal Palace boss would not admit as much, but the grin he wore in the wake of Yannick Bolasie's hat-trick goal told of his satisfaction. Four times on the spin he suffered defeat as Newcastle manager in Tyne-Wear derbies. It was a ruinous run which fractured his relationship with the club's fans and contributed towards his decision to quit Tyneside for south London in January.

Last weekend he was celebrating a Tyne-Wear derby victory and there was talk of him extending his stay beyond the end of this season. Sunderland, though, are heading for the Championship and Advocaat's reputation is on the line. Pardew's standing, however, has never been higher. He resisted temptation to crow over the identity of the victims and instead hailed the players who have now won four on the bounce. 'We were excellent. We were almost unplayable,' said Pardew. 'We're a team that is bang in form and as a manager you can only be so proud. The scoreline flattered Sunderland a little bit. That front quartet were irresistible at times. We are an honest group with that pace and power and that makes us a very dangerous team.' Bolasie's treble bettered his total from the entirety of this campaign. And Pardew added: 'I'm surprised he hasn't scored more goals. He's the first Palace player to get a Premier League hat-trick as well, so that is a surprise. 'He's at an age where he is improving.

And the new boss said: 'I was shocked. You can see what can change in just six days. We were not in the game. Even in the first half Palace were better. 'We gave it all away inside just seven minutes. The work-rate from their strikers and the pace they have made it very difficult. We did not create any chances. That is a big concern.

The first half had been a depressing demonstration of two sides fouling one another, an occasional half-chance punctuating the boredom. Jack Rodwell lunged recklessly into the leg of James McArthur with the ball long gone and was lucky to see just yellow. We did see red moments later, albeit the blood streaming from Costel Pantilimon's mouth after Scott Dann planted his boot in the goalkeeper's face when competing for a loose ball. Dann, in fairness, was unfortunate to be booked. And the game soon had its third caution when Lee Cattermole, having been robbed by Bolasie on halfway, desperately hauled the forward back by the trim of his shirt. Palace, though, broke the tedium with their early blitz after the break. Bolasie was the provider for the opener when his cross was deflected onto the brow of Murray, who planted home from four yards for his sixth goal in as many matches. Murray tries to keep possession under the attention of Sunderland captain John O'Shea during the contest at the Stadium of Light . The stands emptied during the second-half at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland conceded four goals in quick succession . Bolasie applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping Crystal Palace to a 4-1 victory at Sunderland with a fine hat-trick . Within three minutes the livewire Congolese had his first. Dann loaded a ball forward from his own half, Murray rose to flick on and Bolasie escaped to poke through Pantilimon. The visitors were three in front come the 54th minute, and again a long ball proved Sunderland's undoing as Bolasie pounced to rob the dithering John O'Shea before lifting over Pantilimon. He did not have to wait long for his hat-trick. Palace broke through Murray down the right and he squared for Bolasie who, after out-scrapping Pantilimon and Santiago Vergini, poked home for his first senior treble. Sunderland did steal a barely deserved consolation when Connor Wickham turned in Patrick Van Aanholt's cross, but it mattered not and news of Leicester and Aston Villa's victories has them looking down once more. For Pardew, things are very much looking up."}

That is the confident expectation of broadcasting titan NBC, who hold the live rights to show matches Stateside and have more than doubled US interest in England’s elite division in the past two years. In 2012-13, some 13 million different Americans watched at least one top-flight English game live. Last season that was 32 million — or more than one in 10 people in the US. This weekend, for the first time, reflecting their boom product, NBC have transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England. NBC host Rebecca Lowe has helped to improve coverage of the Premier League in America . Star anchor Lowe was at Turf Moor to present Burnley's Premier League match against Arsenal . Lowe was joined by former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle and retired MLS star Kyle Martino . Lifelong Crystal Palace fan Lowe is married to former Cheltenham manager Paul Buckle . Star anchor Rebecca Lowe was at Turf Moor for Burnley against Arsenal, joined by former USA midfielder Kyle Martino — a pin-up at LA Galaxy just before David Beckham — and fellow pundit Robbie Earle, now based in Los Angeles. The trio, plus pitchside analysts Lee Dixon and Robbie Mustoe, will also be at the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and at Anfield for Liverpool-Newcastle on Monday. ‘The Premier League sells itself with its drama,’ says Lowe, 34, a former BBC and ESPN journalist snapped up to be the face of the PL in the USA by NBC two years ago. ‘But you can always enhance your coverage and that’s why we’re here this weekend.’ Lowe herself is a lifelong Crystal Palace fan, and had one eye on their stunning 4-1 win at Sunderland. As she told the LA Times recently, tongue in cheek, her support of Palace is not a sign that she can’t recognise good football. ‘I hope that people look at me and say she actually knows football because to be a Crystal Palace fan, you have to really want to be in football,’ she said. ‘It’s not easy being a Crystal Palace fan. I could pick United or City or Chelsea or Arsenal and I probably would have had a much happier childhood.’ Lowe now finds herself helping to influence the footballing choices of young Americans. ‘When I first moved to the States two years ago I hardly saw a [replica] Premier League shirt,’ she says. ‘Now they’re all over the place, and not just the big teams.’ Lowe was at Turf Moor to see Arsenal claim all three points thanks to a goal by Aaron Ramsey . Lee Dixon provided pitchside analysis for NBC as his former side defeated relegation candidates Burnley . NBC transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England for this weekend's round of matches . Every match is shown live in the USA. At 7am eastern time on Saturday, midday in Britain, NBC’s weekend PL broadcasting opened with a long shot of Turf Moor set against the Lancashire hills and Lowe describing how football has been played at this ground since 1883. ‘This country is so rich in history, it’s part of the appeal,’ says Lowe, a Londoner who is married to football manager Paul Buckle, who recently parted company with Cheltenham. ‘It’s important that we do tell our audience about [smaller clubs like] Burnley because otherwise it could all be Arsenal, United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool,’ Lowe says. ‘We’re passionate about educating and informing our audience.’ Martino says that when NBC won the rights to show games — for the three-year period, 2013-16, for $250 million (£167m) — some critics feared that showing every match ‘was going to be overkill … [but] what we’ve found is there is a demand for that level of consumption of this product’. The USA is the third most lucrative market now for the League in rights terms, among 84 separate overseas contracts covering 212 territories. Only Thailand, where broadcasters are paying $320m for the current three years and the Middle East (both £213m), offer richer pickings, so far. With the Premier League having recently sealed their record £5bn domestic TV deal for 2016-19 with Sky and BT, attention will now turn to all the overseas deals, to be brokered over the next year. India will be a key market, with a surging middle-class interest, while Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil are seen as having room for growth, among others. All the overseas rights combined fetched £2.23bn for the League for the 2013-16 period (or £743m a year) with increases expected. The USA is high on the list of places the League want to continue building interest, not just to earn more TV cash but to provide the clubs with potentially lucrative markets. Burnley’s chief executive Lee Hoos, an American, told the Mail on Sunday on Saturday that his club’s merchandise sales in the USA have jumped 212 per cent this season simply by being in the League. Leaps of 150 per cent have been recorded in places as far flung as Korea and mainland Europe. Lowe would have been delighted with Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 league win over Sunderland . Burnley have benefitted from the American audience taking an interest in the Premier League, says Lee Hoos . Burnley chief Hoos, pictured withSportsmail's Nick Harris, insists his club's profile is high across the globe . Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has been impressed with NBC's coverage of the Premier League . ‘There are still people here in the UK who will say to me, “Where exactly is Burnley?”,’ he says. ‘Yet our profile has never been higher internationally.’ Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who spent 16 years in MLS, said NBC’s coverage has been ‘transformative’ for the Premier League. He said in the recent past football was seen as ‘niche’ and ‘nerdy’ and ‘it was always cool to knock soccer … but when you get NBC coming into play you’re moving into the mainstream. It’s a sea change’. Three of the four most-watched Premier League games ever in the USA, including the No 1 match, Manchester United versus Arsenal in November, have been during NBC’s current deal. The biggest audience averaged 1.41m people — and that was before breakfast in many cities. The average audience in Britain for a Premier League match across Sky Sport and BT is little more than a million (and almost 500,000 in the US) and the biggest ever audience on Sky averaged below 3 million. United's win over Liverpool attracted 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined . Manchester United's 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in November was the most-watched PL game in the US . Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. The growth of the interest in America means numbers will swell there, with Martino believing phenomenal increases are likely. ‘NBC cover the Olympics, the NFL, they have been covering the big event for a very long time,’ he says. ‘It’s natural for them. It’s the same template [being used to market the Premier League]. ‘In the United States we talk about the NFL getting 19 million on a Monday night. That’s the bar set. And it’s not hyperbole to be ambitious — that’s what’s going to happen one day with the Premier League.’Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. Jon Miller, NBC Sports’ president of programming, said: ‘The Premier League has a very passionate fan base here in the US. It’s also a youthful and affluent fan base as well, relative to other sports on television. ‘We have created a new “day part” in weekend morning television, where fans now come to our networks beginning at 7 in the morning and stay for 5-6 hours. It’s been a terrific partnership. ‘We believe that this is best soccer being played anywhere in the world and Americans gravitate towards the best when available.’"}

The temperature had climbed above 40C for a whole week and even the Aussies were struggling. Appropriately, friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city's hottest restaurants - Celsius! Luckily, it was air-conditioned and served phenomenal food. We especially appreciated the peanut butter and popcorn ice cream. But Adelaide that week was also hot for other reasons. It was the cycling mecca of the world, with 20 teams of Lycra-clad pros and their supporters tearing up the roads and hanging out in coffee bars. Sian Lloyd enjoys a glass of Clare Valley riesling at Skillogalee Winery north of Adelaide in South Australia . Sian meets Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas (centre) and Sir Chris Hoy (right) at the start of the Tour Down Under . Sian takes a ride ahead of the Tour Down Under in Adelaide (left) and meets a bouncy local kangaroo . The Tour Down Under is a big part of the international cycling season and contributes more to the South Australian economy than the F1 Grand Prix (formerly Adelaide-based, now in Melbourne) ever did. Not only was the launch night atmosphere electric, but it was great to catch up with our pals Sir Chris Hoy and Team Sky's Geraint Thomas. We also rubbed shoulders with the Indian cricket team. Howzat! We were staying at the Adina Apartment Hotel, the former Treasury building, where the old tunnels and cabinet rooms can still be seen. The Beatles hid here to evade fans back in 1964. Breakfast was served in the lovely oasis of the serene central courtyard, a delightful start to the day. The hotel is conveniently just round the corner from the splendid Central Market. A trip here is enough to convince anyone that Adelaide is the true food capital of Australia. And bearing in mind that some of the best wine is made within an hour's drive of the city, from the Barossa Valley to McLaren Vale, you feel very indulged. Adelaide is a much softer city than Sydney. It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe. It's not called the City of Roses for nothing - there are lots of perfumed parks as well as wide boulevards.

It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe . Most beaches are half an hour away, but being creatures of habit, we always head for the Adelaide Hills and the foodie haven of Hahndorf. Here we lunch on superb venison pasta and salted caramel crepes at a quaint old cottage called The White House. We then do a bit of wine-tasting in the scenic Hills and lovely McLaren Vale, arriving at the classy Currant Shed in time for supper. Set in a lime grove and bordered by vineyards, this is my husband's favourite restaurant in the world. I've had a thing about cycling the Clare Valley Riesling Trail for some time. Indeed, part of the reason for coming to sunny South Australia was to tick it off my bucket list. So early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of Adelaide, picked up our bikes from Riesling Trail Bike Hire and cycled along a 15-mile-long disused railway, snaking past vineyards and cellar doors. The gradients were gentle, the information boards fascinating and the tongue-tingling rieslings superb. We then treated ourselves to lunch at Skillogalee Winery, sat under a beautiful old olive tree and overlooking valleys lined with vines. The historic town of Hahndorf, settled by Germans near Adelaide, is a true blue foodie haven . The bright green of the vineyards of McLaren Vale, a popular wine regions close to Adelaide . North of Clare is where the Outback truly begins. And that's where we were heading - to the rugged Flinders Ranges mountains. It took three hours to drive to the majestic range, the largest in South Australia. The Flinders have a stark beauty - the light on the rocks, the vegetation, the bouncing kangaroos, all make you feel as if you're a million miles from civilisation. We stayed at Arkaba Station, a 60,000-acre sheep ranch, from where we did incredible guided walks, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of this astounding wild terrain. If you want to do the Flinders in understated luxury, this is the way to do it. Think cream and wood with cashmere blankets, scenic vistas, 4x4 wildlife trips, wonderful meals and languid cocktails at sunset.

Having travelled on the glorious Ghan from Darwin to Adelaide last year, and enjoyed every magical minute, he was determined to travel on its sister train, the Indian Pacific, from Adelaide to Perth. Frankly, I can't think of any better way of seeing Australia. You are treated like royalty, the food is outstanding and the huge views of this beautiful, baked continent are breathtaking. Two nights of cruising overland in air-conditioned splendour - it worked for me! As did the stop-offs, first at the Outback ghost town of Cook and finally at floodlit Kalgoorlie, the biggest open-cast gold mine in the country. The size and scale of the Super Pit and machinery were mindblowing. The same goes for the Nullarbor Plain which has hardly changed in millions of years. We crossed it on the longest stretch of straight rail track on earth - 297 miles without a hint of a curve. We arrived at the Indian Pacific terminal in Perth as fresh as daisies, and drove the three hours to Margaret River without stopping. But this is where we realised we'd made a big mistake. This was our first visit to Western Australia and to tag it on to the end of our holiday just did not do the region justice. The unique mining town of Kalgoorlie is  home to Australia's biggest over-cast gold mine . Sister train of the north to south Ghan, the Indian Pacific takes passengers from Adelaide to Perth . From the first step we took on the Cape to Cape Explorer walk with our guide we knew we'd found exactly what we wanted. The landscape spelt out AUSTRALIA. The views of turquoise bays and stretches of white sand, dotted with surfers, were postcard-perfect. Behind the beautiful Margaret River coastline, there are mysterious forests and caves. There's even a lighthouse where two mighty oceans meet. And then there are vineyards... In less than 50 years, Margaret River has become one of the world's greatest wine regions, gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. Not only are you spoilt for choice for wines, but the food is up there with the best. Stand-out meals were the amazing breakfast at the luxury boutique hotel Cape Lodge, the special lunch hosted by the owners of Leeuwin Estate and the dreamy duck curry in the beautiful setting of Aravina Estate. The stunning coastline of the Margaret River, which is also one of the world's great wine regions . A special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of Leeuwin Estate in the revered Margaret River region . And how about sipping world famous Cullen red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine? This is the stuff memories are made of. We fell in love with Margaret River. Our last two nights were spent in a gorgeous villa at Injidup Spa Retreat, a peaceful paradise overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was such a stunning spot, and we were so relaxed after our massages, that we did not want to go out for dinner. Instead, we ordered hampers of local food from Lamonts Deli, along with bars of the local Bahen & Co Almond & Sea Salt chocolate, and ate splendidly at sunset on our terrace. We toasted the sun, sand and surf and vowed to come back.

The 250-piece Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the #LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn’t get there with this launch and for that, we’re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That’s frustrating, both for them and for us. We’re taking a close look at what happened. We’re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we’re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we’d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party ."}

He struck me as a thoroughly decent young man who lives his life the right way. He is a credit to his family and his easy-going manner means he must a dream to work with. We discussed life at Arsenal, scoring against Manchester United and his FA Cup dreams. You can watch the full interview on Football Focus on BBC One today at 12.10pm and Reading’s semi-final with Arsenal live on BBC One from 5.05pm. Danny Welbeck talks to Sportsmail's Martin Keown ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading . MARTIN KEOWN: You’ve played at Wembley many times and you’ve played in a semi-final as well but you’re now one step away from an FA Cup final. Does that bring extra nerves? DANNY WELBECK: Not really. I think we’ve basically just got to play the game, not the occasion. The team was in this position last year and coming up against Wigan proved to be one of the toughest games of the season. Against Reading today is going to be another tough game. We’ve just got to approach it the right way and we want to get through to the final. Welbeck expects a tough test as Arsenal face a Championship side at Wembley for the second year in a row . KEOWN: How are you settling in? You seem to have been here all your life almost and you’ve only been here seven or eight months. WELBECK: The staff at the club, at the training ground and everyone has been very welcoming. The fans have been brilliant. My team-mates are class and I’m just really enjoying my time here. I’ve settled in very well. It’s a transitional year for me, getting to know new players, new team-mates, new systems and new ways of going about things at a different club. I think I’ve put in a few good performances. I’ve been unlucky on the club front with goals and that’s something I know will come in abundance when I get to know everything spot on with the club and I’m pretty sure that will happen. The Arsenal striker thinks he has been unlucky in front of goal, but wants to play in a more central role . KEOWN: You talk about goals, you’re playing in a wide position. What’s your favourite position? WELBECK: It’s no secret I prefer to play down the middle. But the formation we play at Arsenal, you’re playing on the left or the right. We’re always interchanging, playing in a three-man attack. It’s much easier doing that than playing left midfield or left wing in a four-man midfield. KEOWN: Wenger has worked with lots of strikers over the years and been able to develop them. What’s the area that he’s working on most with you most of all? WELBECK: We talk about the game, we analyse performances and on the training pitch we’ve also got the other staff here so after training we do a bit of individual work so that happens every day. You are always looking at ways to improve as a player, to develop and I feel like I am developing well as a player. Welbeck, who says he has been made to feel very welcome at Arsenal, holds of Nacho Monreal in training . KEOWN: Is it your movement he works on? Is it holding up the ball? Finishing? Or is it a combination? WELBECK: It’s a combination of everything. You don’t just work on one thing. Every single day all the lads after training go out and do finishing. KEOWN: Does that become competitive? To see who can score the most goals? WELBECK: Yeah it does! It gets competitive but it’s obviously all fun. But at the end of the day nobody wants to come last. We work on a lot of areas of our game. Like his team-mate Theo Walcott, Welbeck is often forced out wide, despite preferring being a central striker . KEOWN: In the last round you put out Manchester United. How did it feel to score at Old Trafford? WELBECK: It was a weird occasion for me going to back to Old Trafford on the away side. The weirdest thing was warming up on the other side of the pitch. It just felt a bit weird. But you have to treat it like it’s any other game and play the game, not the occasion. Obviously I was going back to a club that brought me up and going back to the fans that supported me for years, playing against old team-mates, my old friends, it was a weird occasion. But I scored the goal, a big goal to get us through to the semi-final. So it was a spur of the moment to celebrate. The English international scored the winning goal on his return to Old Trafford in the quarter finals last month . KEOWN: Did it cross your mind not to celebrate? WELBECK: Leading up to the game I had no plans whatsoever. I just wanted to play the game, get it over and done with and get through to Wembley and get to the semi-final. That’s what happened. I scored the goal and whatever I did I would have been criticised – criticised if I celebrated or criticised if I didn’t. It was just spur of the moment. KEOWN: Against Manchester United you seemed extra motivated. Was it anything to do with Louis Van Gaal’s comments before the match? WELBECK: I didn’t see the comments. Going into every game I want to be motivated. Playing against Manchester United – I did it earlier in the season at the Emirates – and then it was a bit different this time going back to Old Trafford. There was motivation there but I’m motivated in every game. I want to do well for my team, try and win the game and in that case get through to the semi-final. Listen, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, some you like, some you don’t like but that’s just football and it’s life. You deal with it. Welbeck celebrates in front of his old fans, a decision he says was entirely spur of the moment . KEOWN: I think you showed a lot of mental strength going into that situation. It’s always difficult going back. WELBECK: You’ve got to be strong mentally living the life and being a professional footballer. There’s a lot of people out to get you and whatever you do, everyone’s watching. You’ve just got to be switched on 100 per cent of the time. That’s just the way I’ve been brought up. My parents are lovely, caring people and they look after me well, they brought me up well and it’s the same with me and my brothers that’s credit to them. The striker has quickly become a favourite at the Emirates, and he thanked the fans for their support . KEOWN: This weekend it’s Reading. Have you looked much at their team? WELBECK: You get to watch a few games throughout the season. I know they’ve got players with Premier League experience. I’ve seen them a couple of games this season being a bit direct. [Pavel] Pogrebnyak’s a player they look for quite often from the back and the wingers will be coming inside to get the ball and flick-ons. Hal Robson-Kanu plays a bit more inside and [Gareth] McCleary is a bit more out and out on the right wing. Welbeck has been working hard in training to try and improve his finishing, along with his team-mates . KEOWN: Good knowledge… . WELBECK: Yeah I know quite a lot about football! KEOWN: As a centre forward or a winger, do you look for the weaknesses in the opposition? WELBECK: You’ve got to analyse the positives and negatives in every single team. You look at that and obviously see where you can nullify their attack and see where their weaknesses are at the back. The Gunners forward picked out Pavel Pogrebnyak as one of Reading's most dangerous players . KEOWN: How much would it mean to you to get to the FA Cup final? WELBECK: It would mean a lot. I’ve been in this position before with Man United when we played Everton in the semi-finals a few years back and we lost on penalties. I remember the situation, I remember how I felt that day and that’s something I don’t want to feel again. I just want to get to the next stage, get to the final. This is a very important game so we’re all looking forward to it, we’re going to approach it like it’s any other and play the game not the occasion."}

In fact, head coach John Carver fears his side – the worst in the division on present form – could yet plummet towards the bottom three. ‘We are in amongst a relegation battle. Leicester, for example, are winning games, but we aren’t,’ he said after goals from Nacer Chadli, Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane’s 30th of the season condemned them to a 10th loss in 14.

It’s another defeat and that’s not good enough. This is the most difficult situation I’ve ever been in but I’m not going to give up on it.’ Although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47, 427 – making it the biggest of the weekend in the top-flight – estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million before revealing they have a further £34m in the bank. The billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if Newcastle are to avoid a season-long struggle against relegation next time around. One banner – unfurled during a pre-match protest outside of the Gallowgate End – captured the mood of frustration and mistrust among supporters – ‘NUFC – Balance sheet champions, 2008-2014’. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on Ashley. ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters?’ he said. ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again. ‘So he’s balanced the books and he’s made money because he’s a businessman, but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ The defeat leaves Newcastle seven points above the drop zone and Carver has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from. Tottenham striker Harry Kane at full stretch with of Spurs is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . After Kane was chosen as caretaker of the captain's armband, Jan Vertonghen returned to lead Tottenham at St James' Park . Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Newcastle's Vernon Anita . On this evidence, they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough. They were hardly helped here by Tim Krul. But perhaps the loss of form of the usually-dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks. The Dutch stopper could have done more to keep out Chadli’s first-half opener and was again culpable as Eriksen struck to restore the lead after Jack Colback had levelled early in the second half. Chadli appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with Krul sluggish in his pursuit of the strike. Carver reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective Yoan Gouffran and midfielder Mehdi Abeid and within 20 seconds they were level when Colback steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home. Chadli was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback arrived in defence .

But parity was to last just eight minutes and Eriksen’s free-kick – intended as a cross – bounced through the weak grasp of Krul and into the back of the net. Krul, in fairness, made a string of fine stops to keep Newcastle within one but he was powerless to prevent Kane rolling beyond him in stoppage-time after he had skipped onto Erik Lamela’s through-ball. In doing so Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season. And the England striker now has Lineker’s total of 35 in his sights. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for Newcastle . Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at Newcastle's home St James' Park . Fans applaud while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, No Ashley' sign, while Colback's Newcastle team-mates join in the celebrations . ‘I'm very proud but there are five games left and, hopefully, I'll get a few more goals,’ he said. Manager Mauricio Pochettino added: ‘We were better than Newcastle and deserved the win. ‘For Harry, it is a fantastic achievement. We need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season, or risk starting next in the second tier.

In Sergio Aguero they boast the joint leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League. Here against West Ham he scored his 20th of the campaign. And in David Silva and Jesus Navas, not to mention a seemingly revitalised Yaya Toure, they had players far too accomplished for the quality of this opposition. But such a dominant, determined display must leave the club’s owners wondering why on earth this was only their third win in nine games after a run of six defeats in their previous eight.

Presumably a victory that strengthens City’s position among the Champions League places, on a weekend when Manchester United lost, eases the pressure on Manuel Pellegrini. But there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in Abu Dhabi that the last few months have proved so problematic. By the end of this encounter the greater, more pressing, concern was for the welfare of Silva. Injured from what both managers agreed was an accidental elbow in the face from Cheikhou Kouyate midway through the second half, the Spanish international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment. He was then taken to hospital. But other problems nevertheless remain for City’s manager Pellegrini when he had to wake to headlines being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of Toure, who reportedly accused the Chilean of being ‘a weak manager’ as well as criticising other prominent members of the club hierarchy, too. Pellegrini was asked to respond but declined to comment. With managers such as Jurgen Klopp now available for hire, these stories are poorly timed for Pellegrini. But he can at least take comfort in the way his team responded to that crushing defeat at Old Trafford the previous weekend. ‘After two defeats in a row it was a very important win,’ added Pellegrini. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini watches on at the Etihad Stadium as his side seeked to get back to winning ways on Sunday .

English duo Mark Noble (left) and Frank Lampard vie for the ball as West Ham traveled to the Etihad Stadium to take on Manchester City . Aleksandar Kolarov goes down under the challenge of West Ham defender Carl Jenkinson in the penalty area but was only awarded a corner . With another match here at home coming next, against Aston Villa, City’s manager is sure to be encouraged by the form of Aguero. Until Sunday he had failed to score a Premier League goal from open play at the Etihad since November 2. But the goal he scored in this contest was neatly taken; much more like the striker City’s subdued supporters have grown to admire. He thrived on the possession City were enjoying — 75 per cent for the first 15 minutes — and joined Silva and Alek-sandar Kolarov in threatening West Ham’s goal early on. City’s opening goal, scored after 18 minutes, was an absolute horror for West Ham. First came Aaron Cresswell’s failure to win an aerial contest with the diminutive Navas, and then a spectacular own goal from James Collins.

In trying to intercept a cross from Navas, the West Ham centre half succeeded only in scoring with a sliced volley, the ball spinning off his boot and over the head of Adrian before flying home via the underside of the crossbar. If it was a little unfortunate for the visitors it remained a product of the pressure City were exerting. A West Ham side probably unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding their own manager offered little in return. Carlton Cole almost seized on a mistake from Martin Demichelis only for Joe Hart to block his shot, while City’s goalkeeper then marked his 28th birthday by denying Enner Valencia.

The Manchester City players celebrate having taken an early lead at the Etihad on Sunday against West Ham during the Premier League clash . The control nevertheless remained with City, a second goal arriving in the 36th minute after Toure had regained possession from Stewart Downing. A rapidly executed counter-attack followed, with Aguero and Navas combining impressively before Aguero slotted home his 101st Manchester City goal. In the dug-out Sam Allardyce appeared thoroughly hacked off, and understandably so given the ineptitude of his defenders and his side’s lack of ambition going forward. He responded at the start of the second half by pushing Valencia into a more attacking role alongside Cole. But it was City who continued to press, with Adrian doing well to deny Aguero a second. The injury to Silva — earning Kouyate a yellow card despite the fact that it really didn’t look intentional — disrupted City’s rhythm and gave West Ham a little encouragement. Downing went close, as did Valencia. But to no avail. For once Pellegrini had reason to feel a touch more secure.

This time, rather than a chat about a contract spurned it will be a noxious but legal substance once tried and tested by our own Prince Harry that will be under discussion. If Sterling has any sense, he won’t use the distinguished list of those who have previously tried nitrous oxide as an attempt at mitigation. Once again the 20-year-old Liverpool forward has been rather stupid. For Sterling the life lessons are arriving thick and fast. What will perhaps stand rather more impressively in his favour is some of the football Sterling produced in this rather important win for Liverpool.

Ratings by Ian Ladyman at Anfield . Raheem Sterling cuts in from the left to score. Click here for more from Match Zone . There was a moment, just before the hour, when Sterling actually contributed one of the misses of the season. It was one of those he would probably have struggled to do again if he tried. Much earlier in the piece, however, when his team were desperate for a good start, Sterling scored the kind of goal that few can score. It is this that motivates Rodgers as he tries to navigate a way through the current difficulties of the contract negotiations. It is this, and other moments like it, that convince managers like Rodgers that players like Sterling are worth the trouble. For be assured, this was an important win for Liverpool and an important performance. Newcastle may be among the Barclays Premier League’s most compliant current opposition but Liverpool’s own football has been patchy recently. They have an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday and needed victory here to bring momentum and to take them to within four points of Manchester City, the team now occupying the final Champions League position. When the stakes are high, then, you need your best players and here, after some modest recent form of his own, Sterling pitched in early and emphatically. Both sets of players stand for a minute's silence to remember the 96 Liverpool fans who died in 1989 . The minute's silence was impeccably observed by both sets of fans before the match . Captain Jordan Henderson supplied the ammunition with a crossfield pass struck arrow straight to his team-mate over 40 yards. Sterling’s first touch was perfect but then we expect that in the Premier League these days. What followed was even better, though, as he eased inside Ryan Taylor and Daryl Janmaat before striking a perfect right-foot shot to Tim Krul’s left with his instep. Sterling was in total control of events from the moment Henderson’s pass arrived and it was terrific to watch. With centre forward Daniel Sturridge injured again, Sterling once again was crucial to his team’s attacking play. This time he was stationed on the left of a front three that featured Jordan Ibe on the right and Philippe Coutinho through the middle. For a while — for about 30 minutes — Liverpool were excellent and Newcastle struggled to cope. Coutinho was his team’s best player, as he was all night, and he could have scored twice while Sterling brought a low save from Krul from an angle, as indeed did left back Alberto Moreno. The key to it was that Liverpool were playing football that was relaxed and for that they owed much to Sterling’s goal. They should have scored at least one more — maybe two — during this period of dominance. Coutinho was a menace while at the base of the midfield formation Lucas Leiva was playing well enough to make Steven Gerrard fret over the team selection when he is freed from suspension at Wembley this weekend.

When goals don’t arrive, though, things can go wrong and, for 10 minutes either side of half-time, that suddenly looked as though it might happen here. In the 10 minutes before the break Newcastle should have had a penalty when the dreadful Dejan Lovren tripped Ayoze Perez, while the Newcastle forward brought a superb save from Simon Mignolet. Midfielder Mehdi Abeid also threatened twice from 18 yards. Into the second half and, briefly, this surprising pattern continued. Lovren almost disabled his own team-mate Emre Can by standing on his foot and then slashed wildly at a clearance. Mignolet, meanwhile, punched a corner clear under pressure and was happy to see a low drive from Abeid hacked clear by a defender.

Sterling shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers after he was substituted for Fabio Borini in the second half . At this point the game, despite early indications, was in the balance and it was then that Sterling fluffed his lines when handed the chance to settle it. Happily for him, Joe Allen did manage to convert the vital second goal not long after. Sterling’s miss really was spectacular. Another raking cross from Henderson was miscued by Taylor in front of his own goal and when the ball broke for Sterling on the six-yard line it seemed he couldn’t miss. Remarkably he did and, on another night, Krul may have been tempted to offer him a high five in the tunnel. As it was, Allen’s subsequent goal was timely. Newcastle failed to clear a corner properly with 20 minutes left and when Allen’s weak header came back to him off Taylor the Welshman hooked the loose ball high into the corner of the net. Joe Allen watches as his second-half effort beats Krul to double Liverpool's lead and earn them some breathing space . Allen is mobbed by his team-mates after securing three points for Liverpool that closed the gap on Manchester City . With the result settled there was still time for Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko to get himself sent off. Riled by a spat with Glen Johnson, Sissoko clattered into Lucas and received a second yellow card. In truth, he was lucky it was not a straight red and, as club captain, he will doubtless face a few harsh words from his manager on Tuesday morning. It appears that Sterling, in that regard, will not be alone. Moussa Sissoko lunges in on Lucas Leiva with an ugly late challenge to earn a second yellow card .

Still coming to terms with the morning resignation of their most gifted and charismatic coach, Jurgen Klopp, the Bundesliga then saw its champions humbled, embarrassed even, at a feverish Estadio do Dragao on Wednesday night. Not since the days of Jose Mourinho more than a decade ago have FC Porto seen anything quite like this. Porto remain one of Portugal’s eminent teams – they have been champions in three of the last four seasons – and won the Europa League four years ago. But nothing quite feels the same as bringing a genuine European superpower to its knees and Porto and their rapturous supporters went home knowing that they now have a more than a decent chance of squeezing through to the semi-finals of the Champions League when the teams reconvene in Bavaria next Tuesday.

Missing key players, Pep Guardiola’s team were also missing balance, cohesion and an ability to defend properly. Only the cruel would say that in a week when all the talk has been about Guardiola moving to Manchester City in a year’s time, he oversaw a performance rather familiar to those who have been watching the fallen English champions recently. Guardiola’s team started badly and got worse. In the middle of the game they improved a little but as the second half wore on they failed themselves once again. This was a defeat by two goals that they can have no complaints about at all. If they don’t improve markedly next week then they really will go out. Beforehand, there was little to suggest this would happen. Yes, Bayern were without Sebastian Schweinsteiger, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery but Porto are a team with little recent Champions League pedigree. As kick-off approached you could find odds as long as 4-1 on a home win. A couple of minutes in to the game, however, the ground shifted significantly beneath Bayern’s feet and it was, it must be said, entirely their own fault. No doubt expecting a bright start from Porto, Bayern simply had to ride it out. After all, it happens to them wherever they go. They are used to it. Here, though, calamity befell the Germans immediately. Xabi Alonso dithered under pressure from Jackson Martinez on the edge of the penalty area and when the Spanish referee deemed the Porto forward’s challenge legal the Colombian eased clear and was felled by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The German number one could have been sent off but wasn’t. He received only a yellow card. Porto playmaker Ricardo Quaresma, meanwhile, moved forwards to put the penalty to Neuer’s right. An awful start for Bayern and perfect for Porto, the pattern continued and in the tenth minute the visiting team contributed another absolute horror show. This time it was the Brazilian central defender Dante who erred, giving the ball away to Quaresma 40 yards from goal, allowing his opponent to race away and score comfortably with the outside of his right foot as Neuer advanced.

The Porto fans react with joy as Quaresma sprints towards them in celebration of his quick-fire double . There were many people here who perhaps couldn’t believe what they were seeing. On the touchline Guardiola would have been one of them but, outwardly at least, he appeared calm. Robert Lewandowski had already shaved the bar with a header between the two Porto goals and perhaps he was confident that his team would improve sufficiently to save themselves. Certainly the game’s third goal was always going to be important and it was Bayern who scored it. As the first half had worn on they had begun to impose themselves a little and it was therefore no great shock when Jerome Boateng’s low cross from the right was driven in by Thiago Alcantara from close range at the far post in the 28th minute. With an hour of the game – and two and a half hours of the tie – remaining, Guardiola perhaps felt that things were now under some semblance of control. As it turned out, he was wrong. Bayern started the second period almost as badly as they had started the first and would have slipped two behind once more had Neuer not produced the save of the night, acrobatically turning over Hector Herrera’s close range shot.

It was a save that few goalkeepers in Europe perhaps would have made but still Bayern’s problems wouldn’t go away. Porto were too quick and too hungry for them in the middle of the field and the Germans simply couldn’t keep hold of the ball long enough to impose themselves on what should have been inferior opposition. Throughout the whole of the second half, Bayern hardly created an opportunity and when what could yet be the decisive third Porto goal arrived with 25 minutes left it represented another act of self-harming from the visitors. The long ball down the inside left channel really shouldn’t have caused Bayern any problems but Boateng for some reason chose not to head it clear and Martinez then displayed a terrific turn of speed to round Neuer – who left his line as slight favourite - and score from a tight angle. Bayern still had time but they had not the wit to get back in to the game. They will have to do their work at the Allianz Arena in five days’ time. This was Porto’s night and if Portuguese football has something of an inferiority complex these days – and it really has – then evenings like this will go some way to helping.

It was as iconic a moment of the Eighties as Duran Duran, yuppies, football hooliganism and Mrs Thatcher handbagging the unions. It was Steve Davis — lean, robotic and unsmiling — versus Dennis Taylor — tubby and splendidly bespectacled. ‘And so the lights go down,’ whispered commentator Ted Lowe to 18.5million viewers. ‘The players shake hands. One of these lucky chaps will pick up the title, the trophy and £60,000.’ Steve Davis (left) and Dennis Taylor pose with the trophy before their World Snooker final in 1985 . Davis was leading the final 8-0 when he missed a shot on the green that he has rued to this day . Taylor pounced upon the error from Davis to overturn the difference and lead 9-7 overnight . The 1985 final was watched by 18.5million, a BBC2 record, but it is way behind the most-watched sporting events: . 1. 1966 World Cup final 32.30m . 2. 1970 FA Cup final replay Chelsea v Leeds 28.49m . 3. 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony 27.3m . 4. 2012 Closing Ceremony26.3m . 5. 1984 Winter Olympics Torvill and Dean23.95m . 6. 1998 World Cup England v Argentina 23.78m . With those words the biggest British television audience for a post-midnight programme and BBC2’s biggest for anything ever, settled down to watch the 35th and final frame of the 1985 World Championship, a torture of edgy, error-ridden, nerve-frayed snooker lasting 68 minutes. Before reliving those late agonies, we should go back a little further because Davis remembers the turning point of the match not as the black he overcut with his last, disastrous shot of the tournament, but something as innocuous as a green ball in the ninth frame. He was leading 8-0 while Taylor, as Davis put it, was ‘struggling to find the end of his tip with the chalk, never mind the pockets’. Davis says now: ‘If ever I was going to have therapy, it would not be about the black. Anybody could miss a ball under pressure. The green was a different story because I didn’t need to play it. I should have played safe and waited for a better chance. ‘If there is one shot in my whole career I want to go back and play again, it is that one. I missed it and it let Dennis in.’ From being on the verge of 9-0 down, Taylor fought back to 9-7 overnight. ‘I woke up screaming every hour,’ recalls Davis. He was the world No 1, winner the previous two years, and had made the perfect start. ‘What could go wrong?’ he muses now. ‘The green.’ Taylor performs his famous finger-wagging celebration after sinking the final black . To rake up that final with Davis even now is to intrude into a type of personal grief. ‘While I am happy to talk about it, I’m slightly aggrieved that nobody celebrated the 25th anniversary of me beating John Parrott 18-3 in 1989,’ he says, three-quarters joking. ‘Dennis loves it, of course. We say that every opportunity he gets in the commentary box he somehow manages to turn the conversation around to the ’85 final, even when we are discussing a free ball.’ Davis’s lead went from 14-11 to 15-12 to 15-15 to 17-15. Then all square at 17-17. Snooker was in its heyday, with cartoon-book characters such as Hurricane Higgins and Whirlwind White putting it second only to football in national popularity and this frame was the zenith. Davis sipped his water sparingly throughout. Taylor frequently muttered to his mother, who had died, aged 62, a few months before. It provided him with a welcome distraction from watching Davis dominating the table. But the championship came down to the final four balls. Taylor needed them all. He potted a great long brown, a difficult blue and a tricky pink. Taylor went over to kiss the little lady on the trophy before taking on the black. Davis led again 14-11 but the pair were eventually all square at 17-17 in Sheffield . The final came down to four balls left on the table and Taylor needed them all to claim victory . Taylor looks to the trophy for inspiration before taking an important shot in the final against Davis . Davis missed a black that seven out of ten times in competition he would have converted . ‘I don’t know why I did it to this day,’ he said. ‘I think it was either I am going to win you with this shot or lose you with it. I had made my mind up I was going to go for it.’ Taylor tries to double the black into the middle pocket. ‘The crowd opposite the pocket were in a better position than me to see it and they started cheering,’ says Taylor. ‘But it missed by a fraction.’ Davis then plays a superb safety shot, doubling the black from one end to the other. Taylor tries to double it again, this time up and down the table. It falls safe. Davis fluffs his next shot and lets Taylor in — a long black through the blue and green spots and his first genuine chance to take the title. ‘I twitched on it,’ recalls Taylor. ‘It was the biggest twitch ever seen at the Crucible. My head came up and the cue jerked at it. I missed it by so much the black came back and I almost fluked it at the other end.’ Now here was Davis’s chance: a cut into the bottom corner pocket. ‘I walked away thinking there was no way he would miss it,’ says Taylor. Thirty years on, Davis reckons he would have potted this shot nine times out of 10 in practice and seven out of 10 in competition. ‘It was tough but gettable and I was meant to be the man who got everything,’ he says. Referee John Williams calls for silence. Davis approaches the table. ‘I remember that walk was surreal, an out-of-body experience. My legs had gone. It did not feel as if any part of my anatomy was playing that shot.’ He crouches in total silence but overcuts the ball. Davis: ‘I knew I’d lost it at that moment.’ He put his hand to his head. He was white. The black he had left was straight forward. Only nerves could cause Taylor to flunk it. There were more cheers. Taylor, the underdog, was anecdotally most people’s choice to win, though ironically it turned out that his future wife, Louise, was supporting Davis as she watched the match at home. Taylor remembers: ‘I couldn’t believe I was coming back to the table. As I took the shot, I didn’t even grip the cue; I let it rest in my hand, so I would have to let go of it and it wouldn’t deviate.’ It worked, and the black was sunk. Taylor potted a straight forward black to win the final after 14 hours and 50 minutes of snooker . Davis looks at the ground after losing the final he had never been behind in until the last ball hit the pocket . Taylor kisses the trophy after finally emerging victorious after his lengthy duel with Davis . And so after 14 hours and 50 minutes of snooker, for every second of which Taylor had been behind, he was the champion of the world. He held his cue aloft in both hands above his head and pumped it over his head. He wagged his finger. It was an ‘I told you so gesture’ aimed at his friend Trevor East, head of ITV Sport, who had watched all but one session of Taylor’s entire championship campaign. It was 12.19am and time for bed. ‘Interesting’ by Steve Davis is published by Ebury Press, priced at £20."}

Only here on loan from Manchester United for a season, it was a goal that means Hernandez will be adored at the Santiago Bernabeu long after he has gone. But it was also a reward for ambition over the more conservative approach of Diego Simeone and his well-drilled side; for the team that enjoyed twice as much of the ball and the better of the chances that were created in this tense, niggly Champions League quarter-final tie.

It was hard to see what Atletico were trying to achieve at times. A victory on penalties perhaps. But when Arda Turan was dismissed in the 75th minute for what looked like a harsh second yellow card for a challenge on the all-too theatrical Sergio Ramos, an opportunity suddenly presented itself to Real. A frustrated figure until Atletico were reduced to 10 men, Cristiano Ronaldo made a jinking, purposeful run into the penalty area before executing the all-important pass. Hernandez had missed his earlier chances. One of them a clear cut opening thanks to a wonderful reverse-pass from Isco. But this time he delivered, the Little Pea scoring arguably the biggest goal of his career with a sweeping effort from 12 yards. In the starting line-up only because of an injury to Karem Benzema, Hernandez performed much as he has all season here. Committed and energetic but just lacking the class of his temporary club-mates. But with this contest only two minutes from moving into extra-time, goalless if far from gutless, Hernandez made no mistake when it mattered most. Ancelotti seems to beat Atletico when it matters most. In last year’s Champions League final. Here on Wednesday night. Seven times already this season these two teams had met and seven times Real had failed to conquer their less glamorous neighbours. But there is a reason why Ancelotti is the only living manager to have lifted the European Cup on three occasions, and today he is a significant step closer to winning the greatest club competition of all for an unprecedented fourth time. It might even secure his position at the Bernabeu, given how uncertain his future appears to be despite delivering La Decima last season. ‘Every game is an exam and tonight we passed the exam well,’ said the amiable Italian with his trademark chuckle. What an extraordinary night it had been. As early as two hours before kick-off the streets around this magnificent stadium were packed with people, their rhythmic chanting rivalled only by the hum of the police helicopters hovering overhead. Champions League nights between two teams from the same country have this special quality. Rarely has an atmosphere been greater in English football than when Chelsea travelled to Anfield for that first semi-final back in 2005. Real Madrid striker Hernandez had been having a frustrating evening for Real Madrid up until his goal in the 88th minute . Hernandez couldn't quite believe how he missed his chance to give Real Madrid the all-important lead at the Bernabeu before his goal . Hernandez's starting place for Real Madrid was described by local media as the 'biggest match of his career' and he lived up to it . But this was extra special. This was a Madrid derby with a difference and the deafening roar that greeted the end of the Champions League anthem said as much. You could barely hear yourself think never mind what the person sat next to you was saying, and it was no different when Turan was dismissed and when Hernandez then struck the decisive blow. For Ancelotti it must have come as something of a relief after the tactical juggling he had to perform in the absence of key personnel. As well as Benzema, Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Marcello were also missing and the decision to deploy Ramos in midfield caused some concern here. After all, only once before had the Italian tried it and after losing 2-1 to Barcelona he admitted to making a mistake. Afterwards he laughed about it too, joking that attempts to kill him last time had proved unsuccessful so he felt safe doing it again. This game quickly followed a familiar theme, with Real pressing deep in the half of the well-drilled Atletico. Simeone, simmering and animated on the sidelines, applauded his players for the naughty challenges as well as the good ones, seemingly happy to see his side play so negatively.

But the chances would come for Real, with Ronaldo forcing a fine save from the impressive Jan Oblak just before the break and Hernandez failing to capitalise on that delightful ball from Isco just after the restart. Only when Turan was dismissed did the breakthrough come, however, Ronaldo and Hernandez exploiting the slight tactical change Simeone had been forced to make as a result of the red card. Atletico’s manager said he had no regrets. ‘I am proud of my players,’ he said. ‘But congratulations to our rivals, who played a good game and scored a beautiful goal.’ Which it was.

The 27-year-old – who answered bail at Peterlee police station in County Durham on Thursday – will now appear at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20. A statement from Durham Police said: ‘Adam Johnson, a professional footballer aged 27 from Castle Eden, County Durham has this afternoon been charged with three offences of sexual activity with a child under 16 years old, plus one offence of grooming. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity . Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him . Johnson will now appear at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20 . The 27-year-old looks on during Sunderland's 1-0 Premier League win against Newcastle earlier this month . ‘Johnson was initially arrested on Monday, 2nd March and was charged after he answered his police bail today (Thursday) at Peterlee police station. ‘He will appear at the magistrates court in Peterlee on the morning of Wednesday, May 20th.’ Gerry Wareham, CPS Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North East, said he believed there was a realistic prospect of conviction and it was in the public interest for him to be charged. 'Following an investigation by Durham Police, I have today authorised police to charge Adam Johnson, aged 27, with four offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are alleged to have been committed on one girl aged 15 at the time,' he said. 'Adam Johnson was arrested on 2 March this year. 'We have reviewed the available evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and concluded that there is a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to charge Adam Johnson with one offence of meeting a child following sexual grooming, contrary to Section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offence Act 2003. The alleged offences date from 30 December 2014 to 26 February 2015. Johnson was accompanied by his lawyer as the Sunderland winger arrived at the police station on Thursday . He was driven to the police station in a silver 4x4 before entering to answer his bail . The England international (right) was wearing a black tracksuit as he attended the hearing in County Durham . 'Durham Police have charged the defendant accordingly and he is due to appear before Peterlee Magistrates on 20 May. 'May I remind all concerned that the defendant has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. 'I would also remind people that the complainant in this case is entitled to lifelong anonymity under the law. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.' The former England international was suspended by Sunderland pending the outcome of the police investigation after he was initially arrested at his £1.85million mansion on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. However, his club suspension was lifted on March 18 following news that his bail had been extended by five weeks and he has featured as a substitute in Sunderland’s last three matches, including the 1-0 Tyne-Wear derby win over Newcastle. Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothes officers and a forensics team were seen at Johnson’s luxurious home, close to a quiet hamlet in County Durham, and he was questioned at Peterlee police station before being bailed until April 23. Sunderland-born Johnson, whose long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders gave birth to daughter Ayla Sofia in January, signed for the club for £10m from Manchester City in 2012. He has scored 20 times in 116 games for the club, including the winner at Newcastle in this season’s Tyne-Wear derby. The £1.85million house in the North East where Johnson was arrested in March .

The Black Cats winger has made three Premier League appearances under new boss Dick Advocaat (right) As revealed by Sportsmail last month, police raided the dressing rooms at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland's training ground as part of their probe into Johnson. It is also understood that all Sunderland staff were called into meetings following Johnson's arrest and warned away from posting anything about it on social media and from speaking to the press. A source said: 'You don't expect to see police officers in a dressing room and quite a few people at the club were shocked by it. They were looking for things such as second mobile phones and notes, anything that would help them, really.' Changing rooms at the club's Academy of Light training ground were also scoured by local police . Johnson, seen here in action against France in 2010, has made 12 appearances for England . The winger played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . They added: 'All staff were called into meetings and told in no uncertain terms that they were not to put anything on things like Twitter and Facebook and not to talk to the press about it under any circumstances.' The 27-year-old had been training at home in a bid to keep fit after being suspended by Sunderland while the investigation continued. The Black Cats had been sending a fitness coach to Johnson’s two-acre woodland pad to oversee private workouts before the winger was put back into the first-team fold by Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat. Sunderland are yet to confirm if the player will not be available for selection in light of the charges. Johnson has scored 20 goals for the Black Cats since signing for the club in 2012 . Johnson in action for Middlesbrough in 2007 . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a UEFA Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. In May, 2006, he scored his first goal for the club, a deflected effort in a 1-1 draw away to Bolton Wanderers and soon after signed a four-year contract extension. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form and won the North East Football Writers' Young Player of the Year award after 11 goals in 29 Championship appearances. In February 2010, he made a £7million move to Manchester City. City boss Roberto Mancini said: 'Adam is a very good player with fantastic potential, and as a club we are always keen to sign British talent.' He made a bright start and was named man of the match in his first start. Johnson's first goal for City came against Sunderland, leading England manager Fabio Capello to publicly praising him. He was handed first England cap in a World Cup warm-up against Mexico at the age of 22 and named in provisional squad for tournament in South Africa. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. Johnson enjoyed a successful spell at Watford in the Championship, scoring five in 12 games . In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the winger made 97 appearances and won the Premier League . In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year. Winger Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}

Leonardo Ulloa was not supposed to be starting this match, left out in favour of Andrej Kramaric. But when David Nugent suffered injury in the warm-up, Ulloa was sent on. Inside 15 minutes he scored a goal that provided the platform for a victory that looks increasingly like being part of a truly great escape. That familiar melody was hummed loudly by Leicester's fans at full-time, fuelled by Andy King's late second goal and the sight of their team moving off the bottom of the table for the first time since November.

Booked: Amat, Shelvey . Manager: Garry Monk 6 . Referee: Lee Probert . Attendance: 31,121 . Man of the Match: Esteban Cambiasso . Leonardo Ulloa gives Leicester the lead, scoring from Wes Morgan's knock down . One more goal would have taken them out of the relegation places instead of Hull, but much more like this and that will come. This is three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000. Manager Nigel Pearson has been here before. Leicester emerged for this game looking like, one imagines, the pack of dogs that Pearson once fought off with a stick while hiking in the Carpathian mountains. His side are finally bearing teeth at the end of an arduous season, two wins in succession providing genuine hope of a remarkable surge to safety. Shifting off the bottom for the first time since November was the carrot for this game should defeat be avoided. Pearson selected an attacking side, a 3-4-1-2 with genuine wingers in the wide roles. He sent on Ulloa for the injured Nugent and played Andrej Kramaric as No 10. Cambiasso (front) stretches to control the ball ahead of the oncoming Swansea forward Ki Sung-yueng (behind) at the King Power Stadium . Leicester hitman Leonoardo Ulloa (right) strikes the ball to score his side's opening goal against Swansea during the match on Saturday . The home side began with feral ferocity. Straight from kick-off Jamie Vardy drove at the Swansea defence only being halted at the last by Federico Fernandez. The tone was set. The lead Leicester craved was theirs in the 15th minute. Ulloa made the Premier League sit up and take notice at the start of the season with a flurry of goals, but his failure to maintain the momentum contributed largely to Leicester's decline. This was his first Premier League goal in four months, but what an important one. Following a corner the ball was recycled to Marcin Wasilewski, who launched a long ball from halfway that Ulloa flicked-on to Wes Morgan, who had stayed up. The centre-back fed it back to the Argentine who lashed home under the diving leg of Ashley Williams. The King Power Stadium erupted, and Ulloa ran to the dugout to Jon Sanders, the club's player liaison officer, and share a hug. Leicester are very much together at the crucial stage of the season, as this performance illustrated. Swansea were nothing like their fluid best, restricted to long shots easily held by Kasper Schmeichel. At half-time Wasilewski was forced off, with Richie De Laet coming on, and Leicester switched to four at the back. Their energy remained. Three minutes after the break Marc Albrighton fired a shot narrowly wide, and shortly after Kramaric sent a chance over following a breakaway. Schmeichel saved well from Jonjo Shelvey, was again from range, but it was Leicester unpicking Swansea's defence with greater frequency. In the 55th minute Vardy crossed to Ulloa, who sent his header onto the roof of the net while back-peddling. A minute later, Ulloa got free down right and centred, Vardy miscued and Kramaric ballooned a very good opening over. This has been a theme of Leicester's season, always positive but too often missing chances. It has previously proved costly. It would have done again in the 67th minute, but for a stunning save by Schmeichel. Nelson Oliveira ran clear and stayed on his feet when Robert Huth made a desperate lunge – referee Lee Probert could have awarded a penalty and possibly red in any case. Schmeichel came out in star jump fashion – like his dad Peter – and thwarted Oliveira's finish.

Schmeichel grasped the ball and blew out his cheeks moments later after saving another snap shot from Shelvey. Jefferson Montero than saw his shot deflect wide off Morgan when it could have gone anywhere. From then the game was Leicester's. Through Vardy, Albrighton and substitute Riyad Mahrez they possessed pace to counter at speed Swansea struggled to handle. In the 73rd minute Vardy led a two-on-one breakaway but over-hit his pass to Mahrez allowing Lukasz Fabianski time to dive and block. Vardy was again clear six minutes later through Danny Drinkwater's pass and fell under contact from Ashley Williams as he pushed the ball past the Swansea captain. Pearson was incensed but it would have been soft. Vardy sent another chance over, and Fabianski palmed wide a stinging shot by Mahrez. But a minute from time Leicester did seal the win. Esteban Cambiasso, superb all afternoon, fired a free-kick through Swansea's wall, Fabianski spilled the ball, and King applied the required tap-in. The noise was phenomenal. Leicester believe.

The tennis star, who announced his engagement in November last year, tied the knot in the 12th century cathedral before a relatively small group of their family members and close friends. Reverend Colin Renwick, led the service, was pictured outside the cathedral just after 3.00pm this afternoon with the wedding taking place at around 4.00pm. Andy Murray and his wife Kim are all smiles after tying the knot at Dunblane Cathedral . Kim shows her delight after marrying British tennis star Murray on Saturday afternoon . The happy couple are covered in confetti as they make their way out of the wedding ceremony . Murray waves to his fans after making his way out of the cathedral following his wedding . Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep.

Andy tweeted his plans for the day through the use of emojis and it would appear he's counting on plenty of laughter, kissing and alcohol . People continue to gather outside Dunblane Cathedral just hours before the wedding is due to start at 4.30pm . The forecast for the rest of the day isn't on the couple's side although there looks like being some respite from the rain between 3pm and 4pm as guests are expected to arrive. The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm. Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.' Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wife . However the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral. Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations. She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for £1.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal.

The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'. Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'.

But he is reluctant to leave. Most of the rest of his party have gone but he lingers as the final minutes are played out, with the score 0-0. It has been a frustrating night for Salford City, the club Scholes co-owns with former Manchester United team-mates Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. A draw here at Prescot Cables means automatic promotion will become only an outside possibility. Gary Neville and Paul Scholes attending the Salford City game at home to Clitheroe Town on Saturday . (Left to right) Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs co-own the club with Gary Neville (not pictured) Salford are attacking the far end of the ground and the view is obscured but, with 90 seconds remaining, the ball breaks for substitute Gareth Seddon about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. And even from Scholes’s long-distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and Seddon turns away to celebrate. Scholes, too, punches the air, his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last-minute goal against Manchester City in April 2010. ‘We had to win,’ he says, a look of real relief in his eyes. This must compare to watching United in a title run-in. ‘It’s the same,’ he replies nonplussed, before reconsidering. ‘Tonight it has been worse.’ Seddon’s late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen Salford win six on the bounce, their latest victory away at Burscough on Saturday. It takes them five points clear of Darlington, who have a game in hand, at the top of the Evo-Stik League First Division North (four tiers below the Football League). With one week to go promotion is well and truly in their hands. Win at home to Ossett Town on Saturday and they are up. Remarkably, Salford City are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in English football as owners. The former United players, otherwise known as the Class of ’92, are products of the Premier League era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture. Here, though, they seem in their element and none more so than Scholes. Earlier Phil Neville was with him. ‘This is going to ruin my week, this is,’ he mutters as another chance is wasted. This is near the base of the football pyramid: clearly the players are a lot better than Sunday League footballers but the culture is closer to Hackney Marshes than Old Trafford. Scholes sits in one corner with a friend, while Phil Neville, across the table with his father, Neville, informs him that they will be pairing up with One Direction at a forthcoming Pro-Am Golf Day so Scholes might need a stylist to keep up appearances. Scholes pulls a face while the rest of the group laughs at his expense. Meanwhile, the Prescot committee members quietly discuss a promising first half. The Salford owners are scarcely given a second glance, though there is the occasional photo to pose for. A queue of fans wait for food duing the Evo-Stick League Northern Premier match . Jimmy Birtwhistle, pictured with his grandsons, is a committee member and has looked after the turnstile for the past six years . Although yesterday’s 2-1 win at Burscough extended Salford’s lead at the top, the season has been anything but a smooth ride. The original manager Phil Power was sacked in January and left complaining that the decision was delivered by chairman Karen Baird, with the owners failing to contact him. Both Gary and Phil Neville say they did contact him to talk through their reasons but the offer was refused. ‘That was a low moment and not something we want to do often because there are good people at this level and you don’t want them to lose their job,’ said Phil Neville. ‘This season has been a massive learning curve. The biggest lesson we have learnt is we have to take a step away from the playing and coaching side. Let the managers manage and players play. At this level, they are the experts, not us.’ The club are now managed by the duo of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley, who won promotion from this league last season with Ramsbottom United. When Power was in charge, Scholes and Phil Neville attended training and helped out with sessions but, under the new managers, that has come to an end. ‘We had become the meddling owners, everything we didn’t want to be,’ said Phil Neville. Gary Neville takes up the story. ‘Phil and Paul became quite involved in the first three or four months and we found that what might have been seen as a positive didn’t work out that way,’ he said. ‘The players would hear different voices — one week they would be there, the next they’re not there. With coaching, it’s about consistency and repetition. What was seen as being assistance for the previous manager and creating a buzz just didn’t work. ‘The sadness of it all is that we did lose a manager and it was not something we wanted to do. It was not something that we felt good about.’ There have been other adjustments to the non-League level. ‘You never win away games at night in midweek,’ said Phil Neville. ‘Players are tired after a day’s work; often they’ve rushed to the ground sometimes without eating properly; naturally they fade late on.’ Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber now plays for Salford City . Salford City's game against Clitheroe Town on Saturday was free admission for fans . Captain Christopher Lynch works a night shift loading gas bottles, physically demanding work, and usually has to come off after 70 minutes in evening games to go to work. The owners have tried to address the fatigue problem, with the team meeting in a hotel for salad, pasta, chicken and salmon a few hours before their matches. ‘At the start of the season we had a perfect vision that we’ll have the manager now for the next 20 years and we’ll have a set of young players and they’ll see us all the way to the Football League,’ said Phil Neville. ‘But as time has gone on, we’ve learnt from speaking to teams that have come through the divisions, like Fleetwood, Fylde and AFC Wimbledon, that you have to be ruthless.’ If there has been a loss of innocence, there is at least a better understanding of an owner’s lot. ‘You can understand how, when emotions are running high, owners can make bad emotional decisions like bringing players in on big money and putting yourself under financial pressure,’ said Phil Neville. ‘I can see how it runs away with you. When you lose a couple of games you think: “Oh, we need a new player. Let’s just push the budget out a little bit and we’ll make it back here.” But you never make it back.’ LEFT TO RIGHT TOP ROW - Phil Neville, Robbie, Savage, Raimond Van Der Gouw, John O'Kane, Mikael Silvestre, Quinton Fortune . LEFT TO RIGHT BOTTOM ROW - Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Raphael Burke, Ryan Giggs Paul Scholes line up for a Class of '92 v Salford City match last August . Gary Neville added: ‘When we jumped into this we thought this is going to be a big challenge and a lot of people are going to be looking at how this goes. But actually, no matter what happens, if we’re still watching this level of football in five years’ time, we’ll be disappointed because we won’t have progressed, but we’ll still be happy every week. ‘It brings us back down to earth.We might be coaching with England or United or doing a Premier League game or Champions League game in Barcelona. Then three days later you’re at Brighouse away or Ossett Town and there’s a tea lady at half-time saying: “Do you want a cup of tea, love?” It’s just real. People at this level do it for the passion of their clubs and their communities. And though Giggs and Butt haven’t been able to attend as much, because of their coaching duties at Manchester United, Scholes and Phil Neviile clearly feel the same. ‘At the start we asked ourselves why we were doing it,’ said Phil Neville. ‘But when you come down to training, go to matches and mix with the supporters, it just feels real. ‘There’s a simplicity at this level. It’s exciting to watch. I know we want the game to be played in a beautiful way but there is also something beautiful about the style at this level. The roots of English football are actually in the Evo-Stik League.’"}

Hamilton controlled the race in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship. But Rosberg was furious with his Mercedes team-mate, accusing him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.

Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Click here to read Jonathan McEvoy's report from Shanghai as Hamilton wins . With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5secs ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. Asked about the message, Hamilton, with Rosberg sitting next to him in the press conference, replied: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' The last remark, in particular, was a dig in the ribs for Rosberg, who has been out-qualified and finished behind Hamilton at every race so far this season. A clearly fuming Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' Rosberg was clearly angry with Hamilton in the press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . Hamilton waves to the crowd from the podium as Rosberg reflects on finishing behind his team-mate . Asked to respond, Hamilton defended himself as he said: 'It's not my job to look after Nico's race, it's my job to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible. 'That's what I did. I didn't do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up, I was just focused on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in Rosberg and Hamilton colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in the former being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. It proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown. Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn’t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I’m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at timed under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It’s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race. Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I’m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to… it’s not my job to look after Nico’s race. My job’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn’t. The British driver crosses the line in Shanghai after holding off the challenge from Rosberg and Vettel .

Speaking to the BBC, Rosberg was asked about the incident. 'It compromised my race massively at the time because the best possible race for Lewis was to back me off into Vettel so Vettel would try to undercut me and I would have to respond,' he said. 'It was very frustrating Lewis was taking it as easy on his tyres. Interestingly, he said he was just thinking about himself and that says it all. What upset me is we went through exactly that before the race.' Hamilton denied the accusation: 'That's absolutely not the case. I wasn't trying to back him up into Sebastian because ultimately we do need a one-two and that is a priority to the team. If he wanted to get close to overtake he could have done. I'm not really quite sure what his problem is. 'We came here to get one-two and we did. There shouldn't be too much aggro really.' 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:39:42.008 . 2.

This was the second London heist in a week, with the Loftus Road imposter easily identifiable when he whipped off his head gear in front of QPR’s stunned supporters. Cesc Fabregas was the diamond when he worked the opening, following the carefully laid out plans of Eden Hazard and substitute Oscar to pull off this unlikely job for Chelsea. The finish called for precision. Cesc Fabregas arrives late on to convert Eden Hazard's pass and secure all three points for Chelsea at Loftus Road . Fabregas celebrates with Branislav Ivanovic after scoring a late goal which was harsh on QPR, but sent Chelsea seven clear . Jose Mourinho’s team are within inches of the silverware — the Barclays Premier League crown — after this dramatic game of smash and grab. Rob Green had been on guard throughout, but the crestfallen Rangers keeper made the mistake that allowed Chelsea to extend their lead at the top of the table again. You snooze, you lose. It was an important victory for Mourinho, keeping Arsenal at arm’s length by recording their 22nd victory of the season in the Premier League. ‘We have been at the top throughout,’ he declared. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas as Joey Barton and Charlie Austin look on dejected at the final whistle . Charlie Austin lets fly from long range, the best effort for either side in a first half lacking quality in front of goal . Where they rank among the great teams to win the title, such as the Manchester United vintages (1999 and 2009) or Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ (2004) — is of no concern to the Portuguese. Chelsea’s manager has put together a team to win the league, grinding down the opposition until they eventually lift the trophy, probably later this month. They are relentless, we know that. Here at Loftus Road they were met with the resistance of their noisy neighbours QPR, surviving the screams and shouts from the stands to stretch their lead over Arsenal to seven points. Thibaut Courtois made a stunning save to deny Austin, as Chelsea's Belgian goalkeeper kept QPR's forwards at bay . They will meet at the Emirates on April 26, but Chelsea are equipped to survive the sternest and stiffest tests that domestic competition can throw at them. Even Arsene Wenger knows a title-winning team when he sees one. Chelsea had only one shot on target, an improbable statistic for a team that can call upon the dancing feet of Hazard, Willian, substitute Oscar and Fabregas. Joey Barton (above) was everywhere for QPR, but Ramires (below) failed to have much impact. CLICK HERE to see more from Match Zone .

Chelsea were careless in possession, knocked out of their rhythm by the boisterous presence of Karl Henry, Sandro and the bristling figure of Joey Barton strung out across the QPR midfield. This defeat feels tough on them because anyone who can sedate Nemanja Matic and Ramires over the course of 90 minutes probably deserves a bit more. The pair were over-run in that Chelsea midfield. Rangers have found an outlet in the willing, emerging figure of Matt Phillips down their right flank. They have to use and abuse him to stand a chance of staying up. Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta wins the ball from QPR's in-form winger Matt Phillips as the league leaders attempted to control the game . He looked to be their one chance of making something happen, a shuttlecock on that halfway line as he flitted in and out of Chelsea’s half. Cesar Azpilicueta will be glad to see the back of him. So will Gary Cahill, the Chelsea defender who bravely intercepted Phillips’s dangerous first-half crosses from that cultured right boot. Phillips was a menace on that wing. He had a massive chance to put Rangers in front at the start of the second half, denied by the anticipation of Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois when the Belgian moved to his left to turn the shot away for a corner. Joey Barton battles with Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, who was wearing a mask after a collision with Charlie Adam against Stoke last week . When that failed, Rangers went old school, lofting balls into the box in the hope that forwards Bobby Zamora or Charlie Austin would get their head onto one of them. Even against Chelsea captain John Terry and the commanding presence of Cahill, the agricultural approach almost worked. Terry was hammered by QPR fans, choking on the abuse from the stands because of his exchange here with their former centre half Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Didier Drogba, starting in the absence of Diego Costa and Loic Remy, is tackled by Steven Caulker at Loftus Road . John Terry, whose every touch was booed by the Loftus Road crowd, wins the ball ahead of Bobby Zamora to clear the danger . Chelsea’s captain has learned to deal with it, but the trip to Loftus Road is possibly as poisonous as it gets for Terry. He can take his medicine. Rangers were shooting from anywhere, with Austin’s looping effort falling neatly into Courtois’ arms from long range and later drawing a stunning save to the keeper’s right with another poke from distance. Even Barton shanked an effort wide of Courtois’ goal when he was put clean through after the break. They gave this a right, old-fashioned go. Clint Hill puts in a tough tackle on Chelsea's Brazilian winger Willian as QPR battled hard and matched Chelsea in the first half . Loftus Road was a bear pit, with just under 20,000 Rangers crammed into this stadium to watch them match their west London rivals for blood and guts. Under manager Chris Ramsey, they have renewed their faith. Rangers have given themselves a chance of getting out of the mess at the foot of the table after that handsome 4-1 win at West Brom earlier this month, followed by a 3-3 draw with Aston Villa. There is a noticeable shift in mentality, pulling together as they approach the final five games — West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester — of the season. Three are winnable. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck (left) and owner Roman Abramovich share a joke as they watch their team in action at Loftus Road . The Russian was celebrating his 700th game as Chelsea owner since taking over the west London club in 2003 . Terry has to stretch to stop the ball getting through to Zamora as the hosts created the better chances in the first half . Gary Cahill stuck tight to Austin as the QPR front two caused plenty of problems with their direct style of play . Terry clashed with Austin on a number of occasions, in particular when he felt the QPR striker had followed through on Courtois . Chelsea are masters at this, calling on the pedigree of Hazard, in his 100 appearance in the Premier League, Oscar and the timing of Fabregas to secure this narrow win. It was their first chance, the only time in this game when they properly opened up the central defensive pairing of Steven Caulker and Nedum Onuoha. The man in the mask was there to finish the job, scoring in the league for the first time since Chelsea won 2-0 on the road at Stoke on December 22. ‘It’s like failing a driving test,’ admitted QPR’s manager. Here at Loftus Road, Fabregas turned out to be the getaway driver. A QPR fan shouts abuse at Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Oscar as the player prepares to take a corner late on .

The great commentator, who had been receiving treatment for skin cancer since November, began broadcasting for the BBC while still a player in 1963 and carried on until a car crash forced him out of the commentary box in 2013. It was hoped he would still be able to commentate on the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year but ill-health sadly ended hopes of one last masterclass. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his time as Australia captain . Benaud, quite simply, was the voice of summer, both in his native land and in England, as much for what he did not say as what he did. Always understated, Benaud knew when to let the pictures do the talking before entering our living rooms with just the right words. He took 248 Test wickets and hit 2,201 runs, with three centuries, and reclaimed the Ashes for Australia as captain before successfully defending them twice. His commentary rules should be required reading for anyone entering the commentary box today. They included these: never ask a statement; there are no teams in the world called we or they; avoid cliches and banalities; remember that the Titanic was a tragedy and the Ethiopian drought a disaster and neither bears any relation to a dropped catch and, most importantly, don’t take yourself too seriously and have some fun. WATCH SHANE WARNE'S BALL OF THE CENTURY WITH RICHIE BENAUD'S CLASSIC UNDERSTATED COMMENTARY . BENAUD SLAMS AUSTRALIANS FOR BOWLING UNDERARM TO PREVENT NEW ZEALAND FROM SCORING FROM FINAL BALL OF 1981 MATCH . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . January 1952: Test debut against West Indies at Sydney Cricket Ground . January 1952: First of 248 Test wickets and 2,201 Test runs .

Summer 1963: First television commentary for BBC . February 1964: Final Test against South Africa at Sydney Cricket Ground . September 2005: Final commentary in England after 42 years . In becoming one of the leading figures of Kerry Packer’s World Series revolution in the 1970s Benaud gave the fledgling breakaway group the voice of authority they required. Yet any suggestion of his being anti-establishment has long since been forgotten and the leading figures in Australian cricket and life queued up to pay tribute to arguably the most famous Aussie of them all last night. ‘There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn’t listened to Richie Benaud,’ said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and that could also apply to English men and women. ‘He certainly will be very, very much missed.’ Today Abbott offered Benaud's family a state funeral for him, if they wish it. Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said: ‘Our country has lost a national treasure. After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.’ Benaud never lost the ability to say absolutely the right thing and that was never more in evidence than in what will go down as his last significant public words. An evocative 30 second tribute to the late Phillip Hughes was prepared for Channel Nine by Benaud when, as ever, he captured the mood perfectly. Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his side's spin . Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . 'A boy just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green number 408,' read Benaud in what were still his unmistakable tones when the cricket world had to endure what really was a tragedy with the death of a young player at the SCG. 'His father's best mate, son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration. Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace son.' The whole cricketing world will be echoing those sentiments for the greatest commentator of them all. Richie Benaud, who was made an OBE in 1961 for services to cricket, left a wife of 48 years in Daphne and two children from his first marriage. He will forever set the standards for others to follow. Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.' 'My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' 'The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.' 'Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.' ON CAPTAINCY . 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.' 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.' ON BATTING . 'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.' 'Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.' 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' ON BOWLING . 'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.' 'Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.' 'You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.' ON TWENTY20 CRICKET . 'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.' 'As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.' ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY . 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.' ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL . 'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.' MISCELLANEOUS . 'The slow-motion replay doesn't show how fast the ball was really travelling.' 'A cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it.'

'They have my guarantee we will not run out of beer this weekend,' says Scott Sibella. That is a reference to how Ricky Hatton's trans-Atlantic army of 30,000 fans drank the Strip dry when he fought Floyd Mayweather eight years ago. With 10 times that number expected to descend on this oasis in the Nevada desert – just so they can say 'I was there' on the night Mayweather finally fights Manny Pacquiao – the MGM food and beverage department are taking no chances. The MGM Grand is getting ready to host Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao . The hotel resort on the Las Vegas strip will host the biggest boxing contest ever on Saturday night . Advertisements for the fight on Saturday night are all over the MGM Grand hotel ahead of the contest . The MGM Grand expect 50,000 people each day to pass through for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's fight . 1993 - Year opened . 280ft - height of the four 30-storey towers . 2,500 - slot machines and video poker . 7,000 - Rooms and suites . 9,000 - employees work at the hotel . 16,000 - Garden Arena capacity . 100,000 - people expected for the event . 170,000 - Square feet of gaming . A convoy of trucks is already delivering the first consignments of half a million bottles of Budweiser, Miller Lite, Corona and Tecate, who are paying more than $5million (£3.3m) to be one of the fight's sponsors. Many early arrivals are busy now stock-piling cases of their preferred foaming nectar in their rooms at the hotel, which will cost them $1,600 (£1,057) a night come Friday and Saturday. Even at those prices, they are the lucky ones. The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.' Many late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens. Sibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites. Merchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event . A hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather . The hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history . Who do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Who do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Now share your opinion . A hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena. All this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip. In its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting. Sibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.' Nevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights. Projections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (£265m) to well over a billion dollars. This is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years. The MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious. Mayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena . Fewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately . As well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment . It is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.' Fights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao. But it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts. A number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave. Fortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment. After 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control. A Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight . The MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience . Gambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand . The two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous. Resorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first. Although the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations. 'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.' Furthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities – sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng. Metal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon. Mayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana . The unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007 . Hatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009 . Sibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.' More than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties. Even that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (£99) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in – at the arena on Friday – to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds – at $10 a head – will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao. Come Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip. Mayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records . Those travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points. Tyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion. He says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype. If it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.' Just for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed."}

Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT HERE . Host commentator . Real Madrid are now just two points behind league leaders Barcelona. Chelsea may have wrapped up the title in England but it seems like the La Liga race will go right down to the wire. Real Madrid will have Hernandez to thanks for tonight's win as his two goals were decisive in their win over Celta. The home side the better side for large stages throughout the game but Real's quality in the final third made the difference. Yet another sign of respect by Ancelotti towards Celta. The Italian tactician now has six defenders on the pitch following the arrival of Arbeloa. Real Madrid now have three at the back with Carvajal and Marcelo acting as wing backs. Ancelotti's tactical switch shows just how much of a threat Celta have been during the 80-odd minutes or so. Hernandez will not get the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Ancelotti has decided to take the Mexican off. Pepe has been brought on to shore up the back-line. It's that man Hernandez again. Sergio Ramos runs up the pitch before playing a delightful through pass to Hernandez with the outside of his foot. The Mexican then takes one touch to bring the ball down before placing the ball into the net. A fine goal by the Real Madrid loanee. Some great football being played by Celta - and remember their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo. But they are inevitably leaving themselves wide open on the counter. An equaliser doesn't look far off as Real fail to get to grips with Celta. The away side continue to counter attack with Hernandez going close after a neat run from the halfway line. Real Madrid are playing with fire. The home side should have been given a penalty as Kroos has just swiped the legs of Orellana, who was racing towards goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti may have to freshen his side up during the next 10 minutes or so. They are still look far from convincing. Here's a reminder of who the Italian tactician can call on from the bench. Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Ronaldo has always scored against Celta Vigo whenever he has faced the La Liga outfit while wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He will be desperate to add to his outstanding tally of 39 league goals. No Bale and Benzema, no problem - Chicharito and James Rodriguez very good in the first half. Celta still in it but to play that well in the first 45 minutes and to go in at half time losing, it will be hard to lift themselves again. Real Madrid are extremely fortunate to be winning this game. Celta have looked assured and have really troubled their opponent's back-line. Nolito opened the scoring before Real took the lead thanks to goals by Toni Kroos and Javier Hernandez. Celta looked to be heading into the interval on level terms after Santi Mina's goal, however James Rodriguez struck before the break to make it 3-2 to Real. Real Madrid's luck appears to be in tonight as James Rodriguez has just scored an extremely fortunate goal. His shot is heading towards the arms of Sergio, in the Celta goal, until his shot deflects into the opposite corner and lands in the back of the net. Real do not deserve to be winning this game. Ronaldo almost puts his side back in the lead. The Portuguese forward races past Celta's defence before unleashing a low shot which looks destined to be heading for the back of the net. However his left-footed drives smashes against the post and rebounds to a Celta player. Remains 2-2. Barcelona will be delighted with the scoreline and Celta Vigo's performance during the opening 40 minutes of tonight's game. The home side continue to look the better side but they must be wary of Real's threat on the counter-attack. Real appear to be struggling in the absence of two members of the famous 'BBC' trio. They seem to be missing the pace of both Bale and Benzema in the final third. Not just because he's just scored, and not just because he scored four in one game two weeks ago, but 19-year-old Santi Mina is going to be one hell of a player. What is going on here? Just as we think Real are starting to find second gear - Celta go and grab an equaliser. This time it is Santi Mina who beats Casillas. He smashes the ball against the woodwork before tapping in the rebound from close range. One man who does seem to have taken confidence from the win over Atletico id Hernandez. He may have had to make do with a place on the bench during the majority of the season but he is now showing his worth. Hernandez shows a burst of pace before finishing past Sergio. I expected Real to come into this match with an extra bounce in their step following their win over Atletico but it has been the complete opposite. They look rattled and have really struggled during the opening 20 minutes of tonight's match. Second big assist in a week from Ronaldo. He's after his 40th league goal tonight. Celta have scored 38 as a team - that's what they are up against. It didn't take long for Real to get back on level terms. Ronaldo goes on a dangerous run down the right but fails to pick out a Real Madrid team-mate. The ball eventually falls to Kroos, who has the easy task of side-footing the ball into the net. Game on. Celta Vigo, who have started the brighter of the two sides, score by hitting Real on the counter attack. Nolito bursts down the left before cutting in between two defenders and shooting low past Iker Casillas. Fully deserved lead for the home side. Bright enough start from Celta. Ancelotti has not won here in any of his previous three visits with three different teams - Juventus, Milan and Madrid last season. Celta have started the match brightly with Real having to sit back and deal with their opponent's attacking threat. It looks like they will not be afraid of the European champions which should make for a good spectacle. Evidence shows that Real Madrid have a better win percentage without their Welsh wizard. Read Ben Nagle's piece on Bale's impact HERE. Manchester United's Javier Hernandez will lead the line for Real Madrid due to the absence of Karim Benzema. The Mexican international will be high in confidence following his late winner in the Champions League against rivals Atletico.

Attention switches from the Barclays Premier League to the La Liga title race as Real Madrid face Celta Vigo at Balaidos in tonight's evening kick-off. The European champions will be desperate to claim all three points in order to pile pressure on rivals Barcelona.

The Reds top the table with 75 representatives in the best XI since the Premier League began in 1992, while champions-elect Chelsea are third with 29. Yet having Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic feature in this year's team has seen them close the gap to second-placed Arsenal, currently on 42.

Hazard was named the PFA Player of the Year on Sunday after becoming the poster-boy for Chelsea's push for their first Premier League title since 2010. The Belgium winger has remarkably featured in the Team of the Year every season since 2009 – for both Lille in Ligue 1 and Chelsea in the Premier League. Being named in this year's best XI became Hazard's third in England, yet his hat-trick is nowhere near all-time leader Steven Gerrard. The Liverpool captain has eight to his name, but missed out on a ninth in his final Premier League season before leaving for Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy.

Speaking of the defending champions, City are nowhere near their rivals. They have had just 11 players named since 1992 – the same as Leeds United – with only Shaun Wright-Phillips coming before Sheik Mansour's takeover in 2008. As for their neighbours, David de Gea is the only representative from Old Trafford this year. The Spain goalkeeper joins Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Denis Irwin with two, while Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs remain top with six. With the list stretching back to 1992, we aren't short of blasts from the past. Andy Johnson was named in the PFA Team of the Year for Crystal Palace a decade ago, while Gary Pallister, Denis Irwin, Paul Ince and Eric Cantona all represented Manchester United the year after the Premier League was born.

Lib Dem minister Danny Alexander released details of what he claimed are secret plans drawn up in the last government to cut Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits. The Prime Minister 'flatly rejected' the plans, claiming they were drawn up by civil servants on the orders of Mr Alexander. But the Lib Dems hit back, claiming Mr Cameron himself had asked officials to examine ways to curb access to benefits. David Cameron, campaigning in Wetherby, West Yorkshire today, has hit back at claims the Tories have a secret plan to cut child benefit . Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by the Lib Dems but they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill. According to Danny Alexander, the unimplemented Tory proposals included: . The clash is the worst row between the two former coalition partners and will raise serious doubts about whether they could work together again, if the Tories fall short of a majority. Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by Mr Alexander. But they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill. Tory Chancellor George Osborne has promised to cut £12billion from the welfare bill after the election, but has repeatedly refused to say where the axe will fall. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg expressed outrage that the Tories could not be 'bothered' to come clean about their plans. The Lib Dems have vowed to block the plan as the price of any future coalition deal after May 7. Mr Alexander, who served as Chief Secretary for the Treasury, has now released details of benefit cuts put to the Quad of senior ministers, which included him, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Osborne. He said he was lifting the lid on the internal coalition discussions because his former government colleagues were 'trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election'. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told LBC's Nick Ferrari that he backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions . Vince Cable has claimed the Tories have a 'nasty streak' as he warned workers had been hit hard by the coalition he served in. The Business Secretary claimed the Conservatives would resurrect plans to allow bosses to 'fire at will'. He told The Independent: 'They have an unfinished agenda. 'There is a very nasty streak [in the Conservative Party]. They are not all nasty as individuals. 'I have worked with them for five years. Some of them are perfectly decent, moderate people.' But he warned the Tories would 'chisel away' at workers' rights. The Lib Dems revealed that in June 2012, the Quad was sent a document called 'Welfare Reform Quad Summer Reading Pack' produced by officials working for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Mr Alexander said the previously dropped plans - including limiting Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit to two children at a cost of £3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall. But he was forced to admit that many of the claims set out in today's document had been made public - and rejected by the Tories - in the past. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There are lots of ideas that have been doing the rounds for years, so I think it's not credible for the Conservatives to say they do not know what they're going to do. 'If they are proposing £12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they're going to do, that is highly reckless. 'Equally, if they do know what they want to do and they're not telling the British people, that is deceitful. 'And that does frustrate me because I think that this is one of the issues that in the last seven days of the election campaign people would expect the Conservatives to come clean about.' Mr Clegg  backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the Conservatives needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall. 'I share Danny's intense frustration verging on anger that the Conservatives think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of £1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they can't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve,' he said on an LBC radio phone-in. But the Conservatives dismissed the claim as 'desperate stuff' from the Liberal Democrats and insisted the proposals were 'definitely not our policy'. Mr Osborne told BBC London: 'Well this is a three year old document of policy options that was commissioned by the chief secretary himself. 'We have not put into practice any of these options. We don't support them. We didn't support them. We don't support them in the future.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured in Dewsbury today, said the future of child benefit and tax credits is 'on the ballot paper next week' David Cameron will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns Labour would 'reach into your pay packet' by raising them. Young people have been the biggest winners from the increases in the personal allowance since 2010, according to new figures, with five million under-30s gaining an average of £70 a month each from being taken out of income tax. A further 500,000 will gain from the extension of the policy after the election. The announcement is part of a wider offer to young voters today. This includes a target to cut youth unemployment to the lowest level in the G7 group of nations. With just a week to go until polling stations open across the UK on May 7, Mr Cameron told the Guardian it was 'time to throw caution to the winds, let rip and tell people what you really think'. The Prime Minister - who has in recent days deployed a more energetic approach after criticism of a lacklustre pitch to the electorate - said: 'I think we will get there. But the reason it is taking time is, quite rightly, people want to have a good look and a good think.' Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'This is just a desperate attempt by the Lib Dems to try to move their position in the polls, but it's not going to work because these proposals were never proposed or supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor and they would never be supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor. 'Our principles are very clear when it comes to welfare: it is there to help people, especially to help people get back into work, but also to support the disabled, to support pensioners - and those principles will not change.' Mr Alexander's revelations came as The Times reported growing dissent in Lib Dem ranks over the possibility of entering a second power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if the General Election fails to produce a clear winner. Nick Clegg has based his campaign around the premise that his party would be a restraining influence on either of the main parties. But the newspaper said a number of - mostly unnamed - parliamentarians were increasingly hostile to the prospect of a Tory tie-up, which would have to be approved by a special party conference. Mr Alexander said: 'For five years I won battle after battle to stop the Tories veering off to the right with ideological cuts, and it's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society. 'The coalition has delivered savings in a fair way, but the Tories now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society. 'The Tories have turned their backs on the plan delivered in coalition government. Instead they want to cut £1,500 for eight million households, singling out middle and low-income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off. 'It's clear from our time in government that the Tories' target will be slashing support for families. I'm lifting the lid on this now because the Conservatives are trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election. 'They now ask the British people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax, yet won't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans. They may give with one hand, but they will take away twice as much with the other. 'The Liberal Democrats will take a fairer approach, cutting less than the Conservatives and borrowing less than Labour, to deliver a stronger economy and fairer society with opportunity for everyone.' Labour leader Ed Miliband also seized on the revelation.Speaking ahead of an event in Yorkshire, he said: 'Today we've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week. 'The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families. 'The Tories' secret plan has been revealed. 'And they will put it into practice in just seven days' time if they get the chance. 'It's the final proof that working families can't afford five years of the Tories.‎' CONSERVATIVES . LABOUR .

Emma Giffard, 36, and Ollie Halls, 37, from Somerset, bought the cinema for just £1,200 in 2005 and spent £35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in Devon over five years. They toured the country with the classic bus which became a celebrity, starring alongside Melvyn Bragg in a 20-part BBC2 series 'The Reel History of Britain and in 'George Clarke's Amazing Spaces'. Restored: Britain's last-ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005 . But now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus, which has taken over their lives for more than a decade. 'We've got two children under three,' Emma said. 'Sometimes my mother-in-law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we're on but it's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger.' After years on the road, the couple had their first baby Iona May Giffard Halls in 2012 and five months ago, they're second arrived, Ivy. Since then, Ollie has had to spend five months a year on tour while Emma stays at home with the children and he's now looking forward to having more time with Iona and Ivy. Love affair: Emma and Ollie outside the Bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago . Iona May Giffar Halls, two and a half years old, sits outside the mobile cinema. Her parents are looking to offload the classic so they can concentrate on being parents to her and sister Ivy, five months old. Dad Ollie doesn't want to be on tour as they grow up . Happy families: Mum Emma with Iona May, left, and Ivy, right. The family have just bough they're first home in Somerset . 'I'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if I didn't give it up, I'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus.' It's now listed on eBay for £120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for, but it's not just a bus, it's a piece of British history, listed as 'the soul survivor' of the original fleet. It's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967, to promote British industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation. With a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a Tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside, the Bedford SB3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the 'white heat of technology'. The vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967 . A piece of history: This was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote British industry in the 1960s . Super seven: The vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in Essex where it sat for 14 years . Promoting industry: Bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the 'white heat of technology' But like all modern creations, soon enough they grew old and it wasn't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten. It was owned by the Transport Trust between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in Essex for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in Somerset. In 2005, Ollie Halls and Emma Giffard of the Vintage Mobile Cinema Company bought it for just £1,200 and brought it to Devon, where they carefully restored it with the help of friends. They spent £35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at North Devon schools and villages and beyond. From there it went on to exhibit at film festivals, community, corporate and private events around the UK and abroad, travelling as far as Holland and France. Listed: The rare Bedford mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on eBay for £120,000 . Oliver and Emma are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain. Ollie said: 'It could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad, someone wanting to run the business, or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust. 'I really want it to continue to be out there for people to be able to carry on sharing the experience. 'But we have to decide what route is going to best secure its future, because it's completely unique and owning it means that we're custodians of that little bit of history. Government property: The fleet of Bedford SB3s as they were when they toured the country promoting industry in the 1960s . 'It was never meant to be a career - I just started doing it up as a hobby and it got out of control. 'I was working full time and spending all my spare time and spare money on the bus, lying in the mud in a freezing cold shed wondering if I'd gone mad. 'But people just loved everything about it, which made all the blood, sweat and tears worthwhile. 'They don't make things like this anymore, and it speaks to people's sense of nostalgia. 'It was so popular that it absolutely and 100 per cent took over my life - and it's been hard to give up to because so many people still want the bus.' There's also a new edition which could be a different opportunity to a new owner. The vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years. Re-united: The owners got a call 'out of the blue'  from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years. Now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner . 'We got a phone call out the blue,' said Ollie. 'Someone saw us on the news and realised that the trailer their friend had been using as a woodwork shop belonged with our cinema. 'It's taken a few years but we've finally put them back together.' Ollie had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it, it's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus. 'It's a huge restoration which I don't think I want to do because I have a number of other projects that I'm hoping to work on. 'We've just bought our first house in Somerset which is a restoration project and I've also got a 1940s caravan and another 1960s Bedford truck to work on. 'I'm the kind of guy who likes a challenge but I feel like the bus is done now and I want to work on something new - I've been doing it most of my adult life. 'They drive beautifully together but the trailer is another restoration project - maybe this time for someone else.' Mod cons: Inside the cinema is far from vintage with a full HD projector and Dolby surround sound . The vintage piece is advertised as the 'only surviving' member of a fleet of seven and has 26 1930s-style seats - as well as a few modern tweaks. The projection kit is full HD, with a 7.1 Dolby surround sound, complemented by sound proofing fitted to 'limit external disturbances'. There's also climate control, delivering hot and cold air 'for the comfort of the audience' Ollie and Emma hope that the cinema will remain in use for the people of Britain to enjoy. And although the price-tag is high, potential buyers won't get another opportunity to buy this piece of British history. 'It's one of a kind,' Emma said. 'It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone.'"}

Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of ‘beef masala’ were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors – drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) — are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. “When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of ‘beef masala’. There were other food items too,” Dr Balwinder Singh told Mail Today. Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. “We did not touch the Pakistani aid,” Dr Singh said. “Most of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Pakistan has hurt Nepal’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.” Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the ‘beef masala’ packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘potato bhujia’ and ‘beef masala’. A top Nepal government official said: “The matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.” Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: “I am not aware of the issue…I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.” Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: “(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks….” Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan’s NDMA. “PANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,” the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one’s mother. In Nepal — for long the world’s only Hindu state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: “This kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.” It trumpeted Nepal as the ‘purest Hindu kingdom’ and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. “If people die, then who will vote?” the court asked. “They are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?” the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the ‘apron area’ of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. “DGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It’s scary,” a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. “The team didn’t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,” a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. “Even then, the rescue team members didn’t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,” a senior immigration official said. “They had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn’t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,” a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: “No one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.” The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am."}

And while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a Messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago, a Roman granary, a Franciscan chapel, and even etchings thought to be made by the Knights Templar. Scroll down for 3D tour . Lucian Faggiano's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history, including vast rooms and pottery (shown in this image that features Mr Faggiano left and his son) In a bid to stop the sewage backing up, Mr Faggiano, 60, and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 Via Ascanio Grandi,The New York Times reported. The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium. Lecce, at the heel of Italy’s ‘boot’ was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and an important trading post for the Romans. But the first layers of the city date to the time of Homer, according to local historian Mario De Marco. Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the building has been turned into Museum Faggiano (pictured) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . He imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building, but instead, the DIY mission led to the discovery of a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary (pictured left), a Franciscan chapel - and even etchings from the Knights Templar. An ancient room beneath the modern building is shown right . The search for the pipe (shown in this image of Mr Faggiano and his son) began at the turn of the millennium when no-one could have predicted the treasures hidden beneath the floorboards, which revealed a subterranean world dating back to before the birth of Jesus . It is not unusual for religious relics to turn up in fields or in the middle of the city itself, which has a mixture of old architecture . For example, a century ago, a Roman amphitheatre was recently found beneath a marble column bearing the statue of Lecce’s patron saint, Orontius in the main square and recently a Roman temple was found under a car park. ‘Whenever you dig a hole, centuries of history come out,’ said Severo Martini, a member of the City Council. Years of excavations have seen the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Here, Mr Faggiano carries a piece of Roman pottery from an underground room . The building yielded plenty of nooks and crannies including mysterious shafts (pictured left and right) which lead to older parts of the building deeper and deeper underground . Lucian Faggiano bought the seemingly standard building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy, (marked on this map) but his dream of turning it into a trattoria was put on hold thanks to a broken toilet. Lecce, at the heel of Italy’s ‘boot’ was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and a trading post for the Romans . The origins of Lecce in southern Italy are thought to be more than 2,000 years old. It was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, explaining the city's Greek culture. According to legend, a city called Sybar existed at the time of the Trojan War and was founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, who gave it the name Lupiae, which later became Lecce. Under the emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD, the city moved two miles (3km) northeast, got a theatre and an amphitheatre and was connected to the Hadrian Port. Oronotius of Lecce, who is known as Sant'Oronzo is thought to have served as the city's first Christian bishop and is now Lecce's patron saint. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by king Totila in the Gothic Wars. After that it was conquered once again by the Byzantines in 549 and remained part of the Eastern Empire despite some small conquests. After the Normans arrived in the 11th century, Lecce grew in commercial importance again, having been an important trading post in Roman times. It grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern Italy, evidenced by its many impressive Baroque monuments. Plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to Allied fighters fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. Mr Faggiano asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant, in a building that looked like it was modernised. But when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone, beneath which was a Messapian tomb, built by people who lived in the area before the birth of Jesus. Legend has it the city was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, but then the settlement was called Sybar. Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain, and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife, in part perhaps because he was lowering his youngest son, Davide, 12 though small gaps in the floor to aid his work. But his wife, Anna Maria Sanò suspected the work was more complex than it appeared thanks to the amount of dirty clothes she was washing, and because of dirt and debris being taken away. Investigators shut down the site, warning Mr Faggiano he was conducting an unofficial archaeological dig. After a year, work continued but had to be overseen by heritage officials who witnessed the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Retired cultural heritage official, Giovanni Giangreco, who was involved with the excavation, said: ‘The Faggiano house has layers that are representative of almost all of the city’s history, from the Messapians to the Romans, from the medieval to the Byzantine time.’ Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife. Here, he sorts though pieces of glass and pottery found in one of the rooms. There are even pieces embedded in the wall . Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. The cavernous property has been turned into a museum so visitors can easily see the remains (pictured) Mr Faggiano (pictured here with his son in an ancient underground room) admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant . Despite bearing the financial load of the dig, the family became fascinated about the history beneath their building and made ends meet by renting rooms in it. Mr Faggiano admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant. He said: ‘At one point, I couldn’t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened.’ Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the incredible building has been turned into Museum Faggiano and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers. However, Mr Faggiano hasn’t given up on his culinary dream and is planning on opening a restaurant at a less complex location – even though he finally found the troublesome sewage pipe. Mr Faggiano, pictured here, said: ‘At one point, I couldn’t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened’"}

Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.' MailOnline has contacted Exeter Mosque for comment."}

Mr Bezos' firm, called the Blue Origin company, has long spoken of its desire to take paying astronauts into the cosmos. And now it has performed the first successful test of the vehicle they hope will make that dream a reality. Scroll down for video . Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company has completed a successful spaceflight test in West Texas (shown). The New Shepard vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles (94km) - four miles short of space - before landing. It was unmanned, but will ultimately take six people into space . The test took place from the company’s launch site in West Texas. Called New Shepard, the vehicle consists of a main booster rocket and a six-seater capsule on top, standing 60ft (18 metres) tall. The New Shepard system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys. It includes a Crew Capsule carrying six astronauts atop a separate rocket-powered Propulsion Module, launched from the firm's West Texas Launch Site. Following liftoff, the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes. The Propulsion Module then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the Crew Capsule. The Propulsion Module will finish its flight, descend to Earth, and autonomously perform a rocket-powered vertical landing. The Crew Capsule will go on to coast to the edge of space, providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the Earth and the beauty of our planet. After descent and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, the Crew Capsule will land under parachutes no more than a few miles from the launch site. In addition, the New Shepard vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment. For this, the first test flight of the entire architecture, it was unmanned - but the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space. The cost of a ticket has not yet been announced, but estimates suggest it will be around £130,000 $200,000 - similar to a flight on Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The difference, however, is that while Galactic relies on using a plane to slowly rise into the atmosphere, New Shepard takes off straight up and lands back on the ground. This is known as vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL). And Blue Origin is also much more secretive - with this successful test flight taking many by surprise. In video released by Blue Origin, the booster - using liquid hydrogen and oxygen - lifts the New Shepard vehicle to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future. Once it reached its peak altitude, accelerating at 3Gs, the booster separated from the capsule. ‘The in-space separation of the crew capsule from the propulsion module was perfect,’ Mr Bezso said in a blog post. ‘Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return.’ The flight came as somewhat of a surprise because the company didn't make any announcements in the build up that it would be launching a rocket - unlike its rivals Virgin Galactic and SpaceX who are very open about the tests they will be performing . At peak altitude, 307,000ft (58 miles, 94km) up, the main booster separated from the capsule. On the left, the booster can be seen falling away, while on the right a distant view of the separation is seen. The booster failed to land successfully but the capsule landed without a hitch . Ultimately, the flights will enable six people to go to space. While in space, huge windows will give the customers a stunning view of Earth (artist's impression shown), and they'll also have several minutes of weightlessness, before the capsule falls to Earth and lands using parachutes . Here the capsule is seen returning to Earth on this test flight with its three parachutes. ‘Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return,' Amazon's Jeff Bezos said in a blog post announcing the successful flight . The booster is designed to be able to land on the ground and be reusable, much like rival SpaceX’s own reusable rocket system. On this occasion, however, the booster lost pressure in its hydraulic system and was not recovered. Mr Bezos said the firm was already working on an improved system to make sure the error doesn’t happen again. ‘Assembly of propulsion module serial numbers 2 and 3 is already underway - we’ll be ready to fly again soon,’ he said. In a video a small crowd was seen watching the successful flight from the company's launch site in West Texas - but for the most part the launch was kept a secret . Jeff Bezos (pictured) is better known as the CEO and founder of Amazon, with a fortune of £22.5 billion ($34.7 billion). He founded his Blue Origin company in 2000 . Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder and electric car maker, is competing against Bezos to develop a re-usable rocket . An isolated edge of vast West Texas is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st-century space race, one of two being directed in the Lone Star State by internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart. The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in nearby Van Horn, a way station along Interstate 10, a full decade after he began buying land in one of Texas' largest and most remote counties. At the opposite end — of Texas and the competition — is the highly visible SpaceX venture, led by PayPal co-founder and electric car maker Elon Musk. His company contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from Van Horn, on the southernmost Texas Gulf coast, with the much-publicized goal of sending humans to Mars. SpaceX and Blue Origin are among several U.S. companies engaged in the private space business. Both men have seemingly unlimited resources — Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion — and lofty aspirations: launching a new era of commercial space operations, in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets. Earlier this year a dispute over a design of a floating landing platform - which would be used to launch and land rockets in the middle of the ocean - was dragged through the courts. But a judge said the confrontation would be allowed to continue. In part they are racing to be the first to manufacture and successfully operate reusable rockets - making space flight cheaper. According to The Washington Post, SpaceX has been working on the technology for years, and in January attempted the unprecedented landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge it calls an autonomous spaceport droneship. However the barge and the rocket exploded. SpaceX founder and Musk, center, and Texas Governor Rick Perry turn the first shovel-full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SpaceX launch pad at Boca Chica Beach, Texas, in September 2014 . Combined, the booster and capsule stand 60ft (18 metres) tall, with a feather painted onto the side . This is the walkway astronauts will ultimately use when the company stars its manned flights . In this first test flight, the New Shepard vehicle rose to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future . The flight of the capsule, however, passed without a hitch and it successfully landed on the ground with the help of three parachutes. The company is keen on VTVL because it is ‘scalable to a very large size,’ according to Mr Bezos. And he noted that the company was already working on a larger vehicle, New Shepard’s ‘Very Big Brother’, which is apparently many times New Shepard’s size with five times as much thrust. The company has not yet revealed when it’s next flight will be, or when manned flights will begin. 'We won’t be publishing a calendar for our test flight programme. And, nothing further to contribute regarding pricing,' a spokesperson from Blue Origin told MailOnline. But following this successful flight, many will be expecting the company to go from strength to strength."}

Author Martin Fletcher points the finger at the late Stafford Heginbotham, Bradford City's chairman at the time and a businessman who had been linked to eight previous blazes. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' writes Fletcher, after 15 years spent researching the fire in which four members of his family died. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . The 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at Bradford's ground in 1985 . Fire engulfs Valley Parade on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire . Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . His brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were among the 54 Bradford supporters and two Lincoln supporters who did not survive. Fletcher, who was 12 at the time became determined to challenge the accepted theories which he believes were founded upon a flawed investigation. He discovered that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to at least eight other fires at business premises and insurance claims dating back to 1967. His findings have been published in Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire, which is being serialised in The Guardian. It stops short of a direct accusation of arson but inferences are clear and he is certain more should have been done at the time to investigate the disaster and those responsible. He hopes these questions can be officially addressed and that his research will prompt a new investigation into the disaster as the 30th anniversary approaches next month. No-one has sought accountability for the fire since the official inquiry chaired by High Court judge Oliver Popplewell recorded its findings following five days of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. The inquiry found that a small fire was probably caused by a spark from a discarded cigarette or match dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. It was the final game of the season and should have been a day of celebration. Before kick-off Bradford were presented before with the trophy for winning the Third Division title. The fire was noticed towards the end of the first half and within four minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. There were no fire extinguishers and no designated fire escapes. A 12-year-old Martin Fletcher is comforted by his mother Susan in 1985 after the Bradford Fire disaster .

Prime minister Margaret Thatcher visits the scene of the disaster with her husband Dennis in 1985 . Tributes paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day Bradford should have been celebrating . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. The tragedy, followed by Heysel, less than three weeks later, and Hillsborough in 1989, accelerated safety changes in football ground. The community turned inwards to comfort each other. They raised money for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary and supported friends through the aftermath of loss, physical pain and the psychological problems. They were not inspired by the need to fight and clear their names like the families of those killed at Hillsborough. As a whole they accepted it was a terrible accident and nothing came from the media or the courts to change that view. Bradford City reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service, attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. Times have changed and social media has fuelled a craving for public outpourings of sympathy. Football's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute's silence before all games on April 25, when Bradford play Barnsley at Valley Parade. It is the final game of the season and Bradford always remember the victims of the fire at the home game closest to the anniversary. Representatives from Bradford and Lincoln have also been invited to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend and the FA will be represented at the annual memorial service in Bradford on May 11. These are specific to the 30th anniversary and yet are in tune with a general increase in attention which has coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes. But it sits uneasily with many at Valley Parade. Then-Bradford chairman  Heginbotham (left) outside Valley Parade, where 56 people died and 265 were injured . The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . Investigators look around the burned out stand at Bradford's ground following the tragedy in 1985 . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to Wembley when Bradford reached the League Cup final two years ago. Arsenal and Hull fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year's FA Cup final, a well-intentioned mark of solidarity copied by Oldham fans at Valley Parade, this season. Others have turned up and started to sing 'Stand up for the 56'. Again, this has provoked a mixed response. Some Bradford supporters believe the victims should be remembered in this way, others prefer it to keep it private. A stage documentary called The 56 is touring local theatres and children's entertainers the Chuckle Brothers have launched a charity single with members of Black Lace. Another fan has been selling old seats numbered 1-56 which were reclaimed from the stand this year while '56' branded hoodies and T-shirts are on sale, some more tasteful than others. Profits from some of these ventures will go to the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit (PSBRU) at the University of Bradford, set up by Professor David Sharpe after the fire. In another year of success for Bradford City, with FA Cup wins against Chelsea and Sunderland, the club has found the dynamic is altering around what was once called football's less remembered tragedy. It may never be the same again after Martin Fletcher's book. He started his own investigations in 1994, when his mother told him Valley Parade had not been Heginbotham's first fire. The more he unearthed, the more his mind was made up. His findings will disturb the peace in Bradford."}

The grandmother told a friend she was 'utterly heartbroken' at the news about Chan, who she had befriended in Bali's squalid Kerobokan prison. The Australian pair were the first to die in the latest round of executions  after a final KFC bucket meal. She said: 'The men shot dead were reformed men – good men who transformed the lives of people around them. Their senseless, brutal deaths leave the world a poorer place.If they kill someone as good as Andrew, what hope is there for me? 'I just want to get it over with. I feel like just giving up.' Andrew Chan (right), who befriended Sandiford in prison, and Myuran Sukumaran (left) were killed by firing squad . At Cilacap port, anti-death penalty protesters began playing 'Hallelujah' just prior to news of the deaths . A group of Christians pray and hold a candlelight vigil to protest against the death penalty at Nusakambangan port . Sandiford says Chan – who was sentenced to death in 2005 for masterminding the so-called Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot – helped her cope in jail after she was given her death penalty two years ago. She said: 'I really admire Andrew. He's been an incredible help to me and he would be there for anyone who genuinely needed help inside the prison. 'The heart of the prison has gone since they left. They organised rehabilitation projects. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have running water on the blocks, or the classes in painting, cookery and computers. I would like to send my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones. 'Many things have been said about whether Andrew and Myuran deserved to die for their crimes. I didn’t know those men at the time they committed those crimes 10 years ago. What I can say is that the Andrew and Myuran I knew were men who did good and touched the lives of a great many people, including myself.' Chan – who turned to Christianity and was ordained in prison earlier this year – told Sandiford shortly before his transfer to Execution Island that he was reconciled to his fate. He said: 'I'm not afraid to die but I am afraid of dying. I'm scared of the bullets and I'm scared it won't be a quick death.' The Australian pair were killed by a firing squad on Bali's 'death island', Nusa Kambangan . Sandiford has been languishing on death row in Bali since being convicted of attempting to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine through the island's airport in 2012. She maintains she was forced to transport the drugs to protect her children, whose safety was at stake. The British government refused a request to pay Sandiford's legal fees for her appeal. The British grandmother said she 'really admired Andrew', who was executed  by the firing squad . Reformed drug smugglers Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) were put to death . Earlier ambulances carrying the corpses of Chan and Sukumaran arrived from the 'death island' where they were shot dead. The families of Chan and Sukumaran released a statement following the executions. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers,' they said. 'In the ten years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others. They asked for mercy, but there was none. 'They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' The others executed were Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, Nigerians Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Raheem Agbaje Salami and Okwudili Oyatanze, and Ghanaian Martin Anderson. A law enforcement official was quoted saying: 'The executions went well, without any disruptions.' Armed police lined the road at Cilacap port as the ambulances carrying the coffins of the executed men were transported through a crowd . One of the lawyers for the Bali Nine drug traffickers took to Twitter shortly after their deaths were confirmed . He tweeted, 'I failed. I lost', which was followed by another message apologising for their deaths . Myuran Sukumaran's grief-stricken mother, Raji, pleads for her son's life as her husband Sam looks on . An Indonesian mobile brigade police team, believed to be an execution team, were photographed being taken on a boat to Nusakambangan island . A local television station broadcast a chilling re-enactment of how executions are carried out in Indonesi . In following through with the killings, the Indonesian government ignored agonised pleas for clemency from the prisoners' families and Australian and international officials. All eight death row prisoners refused to wear blindfolds, choosing instead to face their executioners. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - the Filipino drug mule who was the ninth convict sentenced to death - was spared after new information emerged about her case. As news filtered through to the nearby port of Cilacap, supporters prayed and sung 'Amazing Grace' Bali Nine supporters comfort each other at Cilacap after the harrowing news came through . 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. 'Our sons, our brothers. 'In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. 'They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. 'We too, will be forever grateful.' The Chan and Sukumaran families were staying together in a hotel in Cilacap when the murders occurred. Some relatives who were on the island reportedly heard the deadly shots ringing out and 'became hysterical'. A Twitter account purporting to belong to Chan's brother, Michael, tweeted: 'I have just lost a Courageous brother to a flawed Indonesian legal system. I miss you already RIP my Little Brother.' One of the pair's lawyers, Peter Morrissey, told the Nine Network: 'It's a very sad time.. the two boys are gone. 'They were beautiful blokes. It is really sad. 'We did have a good (legal) argument. We still have a good argument. We just don't have anything to (argue) it for. 'We'll all keep fighting the death penalty for sure but it's not going to bring the boys back.' One of the lawyers for the Bali Nine, Todung Mulya Lubis, saw the loss of the young Australian men as a personal failure. 'I failed. I lost,' he wrote on social media. 'I am sorry'. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso (centre) survived - spared after her alleged recruiter turned herself in . Mary Jane Veloso's family appear relieved after arriving at Nusa Kambangan port in Cilacap after their loved one was spared at the 11th hour . As the executions occurred, at nearby Cilacap port anti-death penalty protesters lit white candles and sang 'Hallelujah' and just outside the gates. Later, a silence fell over the area with only singing voices, music of Amazing Grace and prayers heard for the doomed Bali Nine duo. The Australian government is expected to retaliate for Wednesday's executions, which Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had long lobbied against. Even in the final hours, officials were fighting the death penalty ruling. Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world. It ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013. The country, which has now carried out 15 such executions in four months, has vowed to kill all of its 58 foreign drug convicts by the end of the year."}

That's exactly what Tiger Woods was ready for. Some golf. He smiled, slapped his playing partner Rory McIlroy on the back. Damn right he was ready. Not to win maybe. Not yet. By the summer, though, who knows? There have been enough sightings of the old Tiger at Augusta this week not to give up on him yet. The problem with new Tiger, though, is that as desperate as he appears to march on, obstacles line his path, like tree roots. In some cases, exactly like tree roots. At the ninth, playing out of the Augusta pines, Woods found such a root at full pelt on his follow through. He dropped his club like a red-hot poker, face creased with pain. Woods claimed that a bone popped out in his right arm, right there, but he reset it. There was a degree of scepticism about the extent of that injury, but either way it continued to bother him for several holes and was rotten luck. There is, however, a well-worn method of avoiding such misfortune. Hit it on the fairway. Woods did not find a solitary preferred landing area until the 13th, when he was rewarded with an eagle. Up to that point, he spent so much time in the trees he should have been fitted with a lumberjack shirt. At the tenth he was in so deep they were thinking of sending Lassie for help. Tiger Woods looks over his second shot on the seventh hole as the Augusta crowd look on . Woods (left) speaks to playing partner Rory McIlroy as the pair wait to tee off on the first tee . Woods reacts in pain after hitting a shot out of the pine straw on the ninth hole . Still, it could have been worse. This was the Masters that Tiger was advised to miss. There were some sage voices out there, saying his old friend would turn on him, that he might be embarrassed by his favourite homeland course. His game was broken, he was broken, it was argued. This was no country for an old man with faltering short irons. Some folk wanted their happy memories preserved. These four days, however, have revealed a healthier reality. Woods didn't come back too soon, he just took his leave too late. Looking at the tournaments he played in January and February, it was plain he didn't want to be there. He should have called time out then. Had he done so, had he started his recovery earlier, who knows where his game would have been by the time he reached Augusta? Were it not for the phenomenon of Jordan Spieth's first 54 holes, he would have been in contention here starting the final day. Woods, like McIlroy, began six under par but with Spieth ten shots ahead, it was idealistic to even contemplate a charge. Woods would have needed a score approaching the course record, and Spieth a collapse – and he is not well-placed for miracles yet. Another major? Well, you wouldn't bet against that one. Woods tees off on the tenth but in the end he did not manage to challenge runaway winner Jordan Spieth . Woods plays out of the bunker by the sixteenth green at Augusta National . It could be argued that the enthusiasm for Tiger's performance this weekend shows how far he has fallen. After all, two of his four rounds – the first and last – were over par, and in the head to head on Sunday McIlroy beat him by seven shots. This was far from tournament winning golf. Then again McIlroy is the world No 1, Woods 110 places below and has barely played this year. He has reshaped his swing which continues to be a work in progress. He would not say when he will play next after this. 'It won't be for a while,' Woods confirmed. 'I like what I'm doing, so I'm going to go back and work on that.' Where this will leave him for the Majors short-term it is hard to say. He finished in the top 20 here, his best return since 2013 and many rated this as the best of several recent comebacks, one that inspired speculation about his readiness for St Andrews in July. He loves the Old Course almost as much as he loves Augusta. It brings the best out of him – and Tiger's best may still be good enough, somewhere, some day. He was blown away here – they all were – by a 21-year-old Texan who has rewritten the record books. By the time Woods and McIlroy stood on the tee at 2.30pm local time, Spieth had spoiled it for just about everyone. Only two men – Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson – were deemed capable of catching him. The world finally saw the two biggest names in golf paired in the final round of a major, only for it to be part of a distant undercard. Maybe that was why Sunday's round fell flat – for Woods, not McIlroy. McIlroy (left) celebrates after sinking a birdie putt on the eighteenth green as Woods looks on . McIlroy (right) taps Woods on the shoulder after the pair shake hands following the end of their round . The Ulsterman finished fourth and shot 66 to equal the best round of the day. Once again, inconsistency cost him dear at Augusta. He was three over par through the first 27 and with Spieth scoring so fiercely the Masters was gone from there. It is Woods's record of 18 under par that Spieth has equalled. In the difficult circumstances that preceded this tournament, Tiger most certainly brought his A game, circa 2015; how was he to know he also required a time machine to make it 1997 again and stay in the mix? What is plain, despite Sunday's disappointment, is that rumours of Tiger's demise were exaggerated. He was diagnosed from afar as having the chipping yips, and there were plenty of amateur physicians declaring his condition at best chronic and at worst incurable. Phil Mickelson, however, offered a second opinion. Speaking at Torrey Pines, where Woods quit after 12 holes to rebuild his short game, he was a rare voice predicting this cautiously positive return. 'I think Tiger's going to have the last laugh,' Mickelson said. 'I think his short game, historically, is one of the best of all time and when you haven't played it's the first thing to feel uncomfortable and the quickest thing to get back. I don't think he's going to have any problems. We have all had stretches where we don't hit it solid and usually it's just a small tweak. It's such a short swing that it's not a hard thing to fix. I don't see that lasting more than a week or two.' Last year's champion Bubba Watson (left) presents winner Spieth with the green jacket at Augusta . Woods reacts after missing a birdie putt on the twelfth hole on Sunday afternoon . Woods hits from the edge of the pine by the tenth hole as the large crowds behind him watch on . It took a little longer than that – with considerably harder graft – but considering some feared we had seen the last of Tiger, this was a tentative return to form. If there was a turning point, it came at the 11th on day one, when he missed the green right and saved par with a quite fabulous chip. Anyone who had the chipping yips, it was said, would still be there now, trying to get up and down. Woods would have known the world was watching his every tic, too. His golf has not been without flaws since, not least his driving, but his short game was a weapon around Augusta, as it once was. There had been a practice round earlier in the week in which Woods was rumoured to have outplayed Spieth down the back nine. There was no sign of that individual superiority over the ensuing four days – 19 shots between them and Spieth leading wire to wire – but this was never about Woods winning at Augusta. This was about him being back in the game, holding his end up, about him looking like he was enjoying golf, and life, and there was certainly evidence of that. He will probably need to work sun up to sun down again, and to win a minor, before he can land a major, but would anyone bet against it given the sight of him walking Augusta on Sunday in the company of the world No 1? Ready to play some golf? One day Tiger may face down Rory and it will matter. And maybe even one day soon."}

Musk introduced the Powerwall device at a press conference in California last night and said the technology could 'change the world'. The device, which could be in homes by the end of summer, will be able to store electricity at night when it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Tesla has unveiled a $3,000 (£1,980) home battery that can power an entire house for eight hours. Powerwall is three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed on an outside or inside wall. The left images shows the 10kWh version while on the right is the 7kWh device . The technology powers up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch the battery on during the day to use the home during the day. Powerwall can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency, or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. The  average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. It would then discharge this cheap electricity during the day in quantities large enough to be useful to homes and businesses. The  Powerwall is around three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed either on an outside or inside wall of a home. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. Department of Energy figures state that the average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. According to that figure, a single, fully-charged Powerwall device would be able to meet a quarter of a home's energy needs on any given day. However, it would likely last far less time than eight hours during the mornings and evenings, when homes use the vast majority of their electricity. Musk said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy. The system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home, rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced, then buy it again during peak times. It could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper, stored energy during peak periods. According to tech site Mashable, Musk told attendees at the event: 'Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy. Pictured is a utility-scale version of Powerwall that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power . The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage . Tesla also unveiled the 'Powerpack', which is the big brother of the Powerwall. It describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that can work for businesses, in industrial applications, and public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh. 'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. 'It sounds crazy, but we want to change the entire energy infrastructure of the world to zero carbon.' As well as the daily-use model, Tesla will also launch a 10 kilowatt-hour backup battery, designed to tide homes over during power blackouts, such as those caused by storms. Marketing material for the device, published late Thursday on Tesla's website, says: 'Powerwall is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening. 'It also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup electricity supply. 'Automated, compact and simple to install, Powerwall offers independence from the utility grid and the security of an emergency backup.' Musk said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices, which he touted as a vast improvement over currently-available models. In the past he has said such early batteries 'suck'. He later added that the entire showcase had been powered by a huge array of Powerwall batteries. Pictured is the 'powerpack'.

The latest announcement builds on previous Tesla products, principally its range of cars. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. These batteries 3ft tall (0.9 metres), and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Tesla would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. Powerwall charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening . 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. Deutsche Bank estimates sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at a large factory the company is building in Nevada. Stationary storage systems could be part of a fossil-fuel free lifestyle in which an individual has solar panels on the roof, generating electricity that can power home appliances and recharge batteries in a Tesla Model S sedan parked in the garage. Government subsidies and a dramatic drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are drawing more companies into the home electricity storage business. Tesla has so far received $1.1 million from California's Self-Generation Incentive Program. Tesla has received or is poised to receive state funding for about 600 storage projects in California, according to data from the state. Though valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA. In Tesla's view, such storage systems could become part of a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle in which people can have solar panels on their roof generating electricity to power their home and recharge their electric car batteries ."}

His goal is to match Sir Jackie Stewart’s record of three titles, as we were all reminded when the Scot, who competed in a different and more dangerous age, conducted the podium interviews. Stewart has occasionally been a critic of Hamilton, and not without his reasons, but he was happy to acknowledge on Sunday night that the reigning double world champion is ‘the best out there at the moment’. Hamilton’s faultless behaviour extended to the celebratory spraying of rose water — the substitute drink in these religiously more abstemious countries. There was no repeat of his turning the fizz on a somewhat trapped stewardess as he did in China seven days earlier. In place of that unchivalrous act, he acted with total restraint, looking at the grey-suited women at the side of the presentation party but studiously keeping his distance. Hamilton’s joy must have been immense though. He had beaten Rosberg, a specialist in Bahrain, in qualifying and in the race. Whether the German can recover from this kind of mauling is open to question. However well he drives, he may never be a match for Hamilton at his greatest . The championship dynamic developed in another important way: the Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen look set to stay in the hunt. The internal rivalry at Ferrari may be as important to the outcome of the title as the one, albeit potentially fading, at Mercedes. Raikkonen was second with a strong drive from fourth on the grid, a place ahead of Rosberg, who drove with real gusto but struggled with brake problems. It was always going to be hard to match the front-to-back excitement of last year’s race here. This edition did not reach those towering standards, but there was still a smattering of thrills during the 57 laps of a race whose efficient organisation, friendly paddock, and perfectly choreographed lights are a model of excellence for all grand prix hosts to emulate. The race started with a close dance between the leading cars. Rosberg, in desperate need of a spark to light his championship challenge, dived down the right of the straight, was blocked by Vettel, and then overtaken by Raikkonen as the second corner swept round to the left. But Rosberg harried Raikkonen’s red machine until he made his brave — arguably reckless — move going into the first corner at the start of the fourth lap. It worked, just. Hamilton turned in a strong display at the Sakhir International Circuit to win in Bahrain for the second consecutive year . Hamilton leads the early phase of the grand prix from the Ferrari pair of Sebastian Vettel, who finished fifth, and Kimi Raikkonen . Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene was unimpressed, the Italian mouthing a few words of pure Anglo-Saxon. Hamilton, meanwhile, was running serenely at the front. Rosberg was on a charge. He got close to Vettel when the German ran wide. Then Rosberg attacked. It was a fine move, with the titanium underbellies of both cars sparkling in the dark. Rosberg held Vettel off and powered through. He was now running second behind Hamilton, who was in clear command. Next came the opening round of pit stops. Vettel was first in of the front-runners. Rosberg was in next but emerged from the pits behind the man he had just sweated blood passing. Hamilton was soon in but a slow wheel change delayed him — a mistake for which the team apologised over the radio — as Vettel and Rosberg were now flying around. Suddenly, Hamilton’s gap had narrowed to under a second from more than five seconds . Hamilton leads the pack on the run down to Turn 1 ahead of Vettel and Rosberg as sparks fly in Bahrain . Hamilton leads the field round on the pardare lap in Bahrain, the fourth round of the championship . Hamilton is now 27 points clear of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg as he bids to win his third championship . Rosberg immediately passed Vettel again with another close-your-eyes, hold-on-to-your-hats move. Could Rosberg conjure something special and catch Hamilton? No. If the opportunity was ever there, it did not last long. Hamilton was away, Rosberg’s hopes of victory evaporating in an instant. The next round of stops came along. Vettel was again first in; Rosberg was next, only to come out behind Vettel again; Rosberg then passed Vettel once more when the Ferrari ran wide. But up front now, having stopped only once, was Raikkonen on a different tyre strategy. He would stay out longer before putting in a final burst on the faster soft tyres. Raikkonen was left with about 20 seconds to make up in 17 laps. His deficit was 16.2sec with 15 laps remaining. He was now three seconds quicker than the Mercedes and on course. He continued to eat into those in front of him — Hamilton and Rosberg (who finally got his place from a sometimes erratic Vettel when the Ferrari car needed a new nose). Raikkonen could not catch Hamilton, but Rosberg, suffering brake problems, ran wide and the Ferrari went through for second. Watching from the McLaren hospitality area was Jenson Button. His car, which broke down in qualifying, did not recover from its electrical gremlins to allow him to race. It was only the third race of the last 272 staged the Briton has missed. He tweeted his thoughts from his chair in the paddock, as his countryman shone brighter than all the stars.

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. ‘I wasn’t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,’ said Hamilton, indignantly. ‘I had no real threat from Nico.’ But Rosberg said: ‘It’s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.’ Hamilton countered: ‘My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.’ Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits’ end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg’s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. ‘We have first and second,’ said the three-time world champion. Hamilton salutes the crowd as he makes his way on to the podium to collect his trophy for winning the Chinese Grand Prix . Daniel Ricciardo (left) and Daniil Kvyat battle for position on track - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure . Hamilton is covered in champagne by Rosberg as the Mercedes pair celebrate a one-two finish . ‘I don’t care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel is only third. One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There’s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. ‘There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that’s it.’ For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen’s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having ‘the full house’: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year’s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber, causing Max’s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen’s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull’s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat’s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. Button’s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired . Jenson Button, who finished 13th, was involved in a collision with Pastor Maldonado towards the end of the race ."}

Imagine if he had not turned up for training. Imagine if he had refused to play. Imagine if he had gone on strike. Imagine, even, if he had asked for a transfer away from Liverpool. Imagine the opprobrium that would have been heaped upon him then. Because as it is, he has been labelled an ingrate and a fool. He has been called avaricious, capricious, disloyal and impressionable. He is in thrall, it is said, to a man portrayed as his Iago of an agent. Sterling’s ability has been questioned and his contribution to Liverpool has been mocked. His character has been traduced and scorn has been poured upon the notion that he will ever amount to anything. For what crime exactly? Well, to be honest, it’s hard to say. Raheem Sterling winces during Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal to complete a tough week for the 20-year-old . Brendan Rodgers takes a deep breath as he watches his side succumb to their worst defeat of the season . Sterling is fouled by Hector Bellerin as Liverpool earn a penalty which was converted by Jordan Henderson . OK, so he has not signed the lucrative new contract that the club have put in front of him. Not yet, anyway. Given that he has more than two years left on his existing one, that is hardly a heinous act or a trigger for angst. He wants to wait to the end of the season, he says. So let him. He gave an interview to the BBC that he had not cleared with the club. Not particularly clever, admittedly. And, yes, the reference to being ‘flattered’ by Arsenal’s interest, particularly coming a couple of days before the clash between the two teams at the Emirates, was naïve. But the content of what he said was hardly incendiary. It amounted to a softly-spoken plea for time and space. Sterling is not the kind of person to shout the odds. Maybe he wants a little while to make up his mind. That’s not what Liverpool fans want to hear but it happens. It’s life. People consider their options. It’s their right. For what it’s worth, I hope Sterling stays at Anfield. I hope that sooner or later, he signs that new contract, or perhaps an improved version of it. At this stage of his career, leaving Liverpool is fraught with unnecessary risks. Liverpool are a great club and they are on the rise again. They are staffed by good, intelligent, forward-thinking football people. And I can’t think of any better manager than Brendan Rodgers under whom Sterling should continue the process of maturing into one of Europe’s best players. The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday, giving his opinion on a variety of matters . Brendan Rodgers called the interview 'a mistake' and shakes hands with his protege the day after its airing . Sterling's agent Aidy Ward is pictured sat next to Saido Berahino (centre) at Old Trafford . But none of that means I haven’t found the virulence of the reaction to Sterling’s refusal to sign immediately on the dotted line somewhat startling. The kid is only 20. Give him a break. This is, after all, an old storyline. We talk about loyalty in football as if it is a one-way street. We only apply it to footballers, not to clubs. Clubs generally have very little loyalty to players. They treat them as commodities. Or ‘expensive pieces of meat’, as Roy Keane would have it. And we don’t blink an eye. They pay the players well when they are worth something to them. They pay them to entertain their fans. And to sell season tickets. And to allow them to keep harvesting the vast amounts of Premier League television income flooding into their coffers. And to lift them into the Champions League, where they accrue even more cash. For the club owners, for the men who pay the wages, the relationship with a player is a business transaction. And when the player stops playing as well as he used to, when he loses his form or when he grows older and slower, or when they want to replace him with another player, they get rid of him. Rodgers remains confident that Sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer . It’s about money. It’s that way at Manchester United and at Manchester City. It’s that way at Arsenal and at Chelsea. And it’s that way at Liverpool, too. It’s the way it is and none of us question it. Not really. And yet we do not apply the same standards to players. We expect hard-headed business sense from the clubs but we demand that any nod to rationality is cast away when it comes to the time when players make decisions about their future. In its stead, we demand sentimental attachment from the players to override everything. We are terribly old-fashioned about it. The players should be grateful, we seem to be saying, because Jimmy Hill got the maximum wage abolished in 1961. There are a few, at least, who see the contradictions in that stance. ‘Raheem Sterling is fully entitled to make his own mind up,’ Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter. ‘Make choices that will prove to be right or wrong. It’s his life, his career.’ Lineker is right. I hope Sterling stays at Liverpool but if he asks for time to think before he commits himself, it is absurdly unjust that he should be pilloried for it. Black managers always get the worst jobs . If you are an aspiring manager in English football and you are black, you get used to one thing: when an opportunity comes your way, it’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass. Sorry, but it’s true. With a few exceptions, you don’t get the better opportunities. You get the football version of mopping up the toilets. Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, is a classic example. Ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs. He took the QPR position after Harry Redknapp, a talented, experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble, saw the writing on the wall and got out. Ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and, guess what, it has not been an easy job to refloat it. Before the victory at West Brom, QPR were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on Ramsey. Chris Ramsey (right) and Kevin Hitchcock watch QPR hammer West Brom to keep their survival hopes alive . John Barnes' troubled reign at Celtic ended after an infamous Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caley Thistle . Just as predictably, there were also those saying Ramsey’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance. If Ramsey is sacked, people will say it was about results, not race. And they will be wrong. Because race was why he had to take the job in the first place. People tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the English game. Some got angry again when John Barnes suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he’s black. He was right. The fact Ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at QPR does not mean he is not a good manager. It just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass, the odds are you’re going to get hurt. It was my first visit to the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday and it was hard not to be impressed by the arena’s steep sides, excellent facilities, spectacular location and fine atmosphere. It was also hard not to notice that at a stadium with a capacity of just 41,000, there were 10,000 empty seats for a friendly against another major footballing nation. The Juventus Stadium is a magnificent venue, but fans stayed away from the midweek international friendly . A fan takes a selfie in the midst of a sea of empty seats in Turin with only 31,138 watching the game . England played to a crowd of 83,671 as they cruised past European lightweights Lithuania 4-0 at Wembley . A few days earlier, more than 83,000 fans had packed into Wembley for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania. English football might have plenty of problems but the loyalty of its supporters is not one of them."}

He is the cartoon embodiment of the excess for which his adopted home town of Las Vegas is notorious. A poor kid from Grand Rapids, Michigan, he has spent his adult life over-compensating for the deprivation he once knew. He has tossed handfuls of $100 bills into the air at a strip club and hurled wads of cash into a swimming pool so he could amuse himself by watching girls dive to retrieve them. The mouthguard he will wear during ‘The Fight of the Century’ with Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand on Saturday night cost $25,000 and is inlaid with a $100 bill. Floyd Mayweather Jr is boxing’s undisputed braggart - and a brilliant performer in the ring . Mayweather will take on Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in the most eagerly awaited fight of the century . Some novelists like to assign names to their protagonists that reflect their character traits or their obsessions. Mayweather has saved everyone the trouble with his chosen nickname. John Self, meet Money Mayweather. Money Mayweather reigned until the build-up to this fight began. Then, he took to referring to himself as TBE, or The Best Ever. He is better than Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson ever were, Mayweather said this week. Mayweather, it is also worth pointing out, has faced a string of accusations of violence against women and spent two months in the Clark County Detention Center in 2012 for a domestic violence conviction. Although the fight is not quite the struggle between light and darkness that Pacquiao’s supporters would have you believe, it is true that Mayweather is not exactly a gentleman hero. But in sport’s spoiled, sycophantic world where no one ever tells the genius that he is out of line, that hardly makes him unusual. A floored George Foreman feels the force of Muhammad Ali after his rope-a-dope tactic in the heat of Zaire . Sugar Ray Leonard (right) goes toe-to-toe with Thomas Hearns in their second fight in 1989 . There is a danger here, though. It lies in confusing our perceptions of Mayweather as a man with a desire to belittle his capabilities as a fighter. You might want him to lose to Pacquiao but you better accept that he probably won’t. He is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing. He may not be The Best Ever. Debates aimed at placing that crown on one head are, essentially, specious but it is legitimate to claim that Mayweather is one of the best ever. He has fought the best fighters of his generation, Pacquiao aside, and beaten every one of them. Pacquiao’s trainer, Freddie Roach, said last week that Mayweather, 38, had ducked too many fighters to be considered the greatest even of this era. A cursory examination of Mayweather’s record does not bear that out. He has fought Diego Corrales, Jose Luis Castillo, Arturo Gatti, Sharmba Mitchell, Oscar de la Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Juan Manuel Marquez, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto and sent them all away broken. He has won titles at five different weights. He has fought men like Victor Ortiz and Robert Guerrero, who were supposed to be new forces in boxing, but whose limitations were exposed by Mayweather’s ringcraft. That is the great irony of his dominance of the sport these past few years. He is scorned as a great vulgarian, a gaudy show-off, boxing’s thug king, and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills. Mayweather attacks Robert Guerrero during the his unanimous points win over his countryman . Mayweather floored Victor Ortiz in controversial fashion at the end of the fourth round . Boxing has always venerated the artist and swooned over practitioners of the sweet science and Mayweather personifies so much of what the purists admire. He does not club his foes into submission. He does not overwhelm them with savagery. He beats them with craft and cleverness. He is a wonderful technician in the mould of Willie Pep, Pernell ‘Sweet Pea’ Whitaker and Ali. The shoulder roll he uses to protect his head and body from attack is a conundrum that none of his opponents have been able to decode. He is a pugilist, not a scrapper. When Mayweather boxes, it is to put on an old-fashioned masterclass in the oft-neglected art of defensive combat. He makes himself devilishly hard to hit, and, slowly and steadily, picks off his opponent. His style has made fans of connoisseurs like the late, great fight trainer Eddie Futch. Mayweather is not a crowd-pleaser. He is too good for that. He is so skilled that it is difficult for his opponent to land effective punches. His brand of brilliance does not make for explosive action but it does make for W after W after W on his record. He has 47 of them now to go with no defeats and no draws. Mayweather has attracted criticism for his uncouth displays of his wealth on social media . Freddie Roach (right) is attemtping to force Mayweather to abandon his naturally cautious style . Roach says he has attended Mayweather fights where fans have fallen asleep from boredom. He is trying to goad Mayweather into abandoning his usual style because he knows it represents Pacquiao’s best chance — perhaps only chance — of winning. Roach is a good man and a brilliant trainer but Money Mayweather is way too smart to fall for that. I take him to win by unanimous decision. Pep’s T-shirt protest is no crime, UEFA . UEFA have a chance to claw back at least a little of the dignity and the credibility they have lost in recent years when their disciplinary panel meets on May 21 to consider whether to fine Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola. Guardiola committed the heinous sin of expressing an opinion about something more important than football at his press conference last Monday before Bayern’s Champions League tie with Porto. The punishment for that kind of deviancy is severe if precedent is anything to go by. Football’s twisted world fines you more heavily for wearing branded underpants than indulging in racist chanting. Guardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup . Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car . Guardiola’s crime is to have worn a T-shirt highlighting unanswered issues surrounding the death of a popular and respected Argentinian sports journalist during last year’s World Cup. Jorge ‘Topo’ Lopez, who was a friend of Lionel Messi and Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, was killed in a car crash in Belo Horizonte and several details of the incident are yet to be explained. So Guardiola did the right thing. He wore a shirt bearing the slogan #JusticiaParaTopo. And sure enough, his charge ‘for an incident of a non-sporting nature’ will now be judged by UEFA next month. It is strange, isn’t it, how we condemn our footballers for being one-dimensional and bemoan their lack of social conscience and say they are all spoiled little rich boys. And then as soon as they do something a bit different, as soon as they challenge us, as soon as they break free from the norm, UEFA come down on them like a ton of bricks. If they have any sense left, they will dismiss the charge against Guardiola out of hand. Arsenal's clash with Chelsea at the Emirates  has little relevance for this season’s title race. Chelsea are too far ahead for the result to matter. But it matters for next season. Arsenal, finally, are beginning to look like a team capable of fashioning a real challenge for the title again. They have improved this season despite being without three of their leading players, Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for much of the campaign. By winning at Manchester City and sweeping Liverpool aside, they have started to overcome psychological barriers. Beat Chelsea and another of those barriers will have been shoved out of the way. Chelsea went five points clear after beating Arsenal 2-0 in October with  Eden Hazard and Diego Costa scoring . Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho face off during the last meeting between the two sides ."}

Still in Madrid’s five-star Tivoli Lisboa hotel, the ‘fat boy with the bowl full of Emilian tortellini’ (his own words, not mine) told an Italian journalist friend: ‘Yes we’ve made history by winning La Decima — but this is Real Madrid. Lose two games next season and I’ll still be an “idiot”.’ Date: May 25, 2014. Hotel Address: Liberty Street, Lisbon. And of course Ancelotti was speaking after Madrid’s two principal teams, sworn enemies, had contested the Champions League Final and he had lifted the ‘cup with the big ears’ for the fifth time as player or coach. Carlo Ancelotti is starting to feel the strain after recent poor results at Real Madrid . Ancelotti was a hero after guiding Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup triumph last year . Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring Real's second goal in extra time during the Lisbon final . Cristiano Ronaldo scored his team's fourth late in extra time to secure the famous victory . August 19 - Real 1-1 Atletico . Supercopa, First Leg . August 22 - Atletico 1-0 Real . Supercopa, Second Leg . September 13 - Real 1-2 Atletico . La Liga . January 7 - Atletico 2-0 Real . Copa del Rey Last 16, First Leg . January 15 - Real 2-2 Atletico . Copa del Rey Last 16, Second Leg . February 7 - Atletico 4-0 Real . La Liga . Not that winning liberated him from the sad truth of his statement. Two games? His team have lost almost one out of every three matches in 2015 (six defeats in 19 outings). Worse is the fact that he is now a black smudge on Madrid’s pristine-white history, having already lost to Atletico — the club which was unable to register a single win over Real between 1999 and 2013 — four times in a season. Perhaps worst of all, the European champions’ utterly humiliating 4-0 defeat at the ferocious Calderon stadium last time these two met, just over two months ago, meant Atletico had won all three home ‘derbis’ by a 7-0 aggregate this term. In fact, during each of the seven defeats in 11 derbies Ancelotti has had to soak up as Madrid manager against Diego Simeone’s bruising buccaneers, his team hasn’t scored once. None of which make Ancelotti an idiot. Where they do, cumulatively, leave him is in perhaps the most embarrassing position of his career. Not because if he loses the imminent Champions League quarter-final against Spain’s champions Ancelotti fears the sack. Cristiano Ronaldo sits dejected during Real's 4-0 La Liga defeat to Atletico back in February . Mario Mandzukic (left) celebrates with Fernando Torres after scoring in Atletico's 4-0 win in February . Like Norman Stanley Fletcher in Porridge, there are some penalties in his chosen profession which ‘Carletto’ (Wee Charlie) treats as an occupational hazard. You might argue that losing a 3-0 lead over Liverpool in Istanbul almost exactly a decade ago should constitute that moment of maximum embarrassment. Not so. Ancelotti not only famously doled out revenge on Rafa Benitez’s team two years later — when Milan reached the 2007 final they watched the Liverpool v Chelsea second semi-final together, cheering and roaring for the Reds more hoarsely than any Koppite to go through so that history could be re-visited — he could also come to terms with the remarkable 3-3-and-penalties defeat. His view: ‘My team did its very best to win. So I couldn’t be angry. I think this was destiny. I’ve managed nearly 900 matches in my career and two where my team played exceptionally well were that Istanbul final and the semi against Manchester United in 2007.’ So this is a different red-and-white thorn in his side. Constant defeats during which Real Madrid have not, by any stretch, done their best. Things have, in fact, been getting incrementally worse. May’s final in Lisbon was won the very second that Sergio Ramos made it 1-1 in the 93rd minute. Atletico were, almost literally, out on their feet. A rueful Ancelotti walks past the European Cup after Milan surrendered a three-goal lead against Liverpool . But Ancelotti made up for it by beating Liverpool in 2007 and gaining revenge for that defeat two years before . AC MILAN . UEFA Champions League 2002-03, 2006-07 . UEFA Super Cup 2003, 2007 . FIFA Club World Cup 2007 . Serie A 2003-04 . Coppa Italia 2002-03 . Supercoppa Italiana 2004 . CHELSEA . Premier League 2009-10 . FA Cup 2009-10 . FA Community Shield 2009 . PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN . Ligue 1 2012-13 . REAL MADRID . UEFA Champions League 2013-14 . UEFA Super Cup 2014 . FIFA Club World Cup 2014 . Copa del Rey 2013-14 . Since then, it has been as if Simeone and Co have soaked up all the anger, all the humiliation, all the impotent rage they felt when Cristiano Ronaldo venerated his penalty goal (to kill an already dead match) for 4-1 with his ‘I’m actually the Incredible Hulk’ celebration. In the drama of that night, and amidst the history of Madrid’s tenth title, it's often forgotten that when Rafa Varane kicked the ball at Atletico’s Argentinian manager with two minutes left in extra-time, Simeone chased him onto the pitch then had to be both restrained and persuaded to leave the playing surface before being sent off. Simeone, applauded out of the press conference later that night in appreciation of having won the Spanish title and of how heroically Atletico clung on to Diego Godin’s headed lead in Lisbon, spoke kindly about Varane being ‘just a kid’ with ‘a great future’ in the post-match post-mortem. But, trust me, that was one of the spurs chafing at Simeone’s skin all summer until the Spanish Supercup second leg when Varane was pressed, exposed for awareness and sharpness and Mario Mandzukic bagged the goal which started Atletico’s winning run against Madrid this season. ‘The most important, most intelligent player in every great team is usually a midfielder,’ Ancelotti believes. Atletico manager Diego Simeone rushes on to confront Real defender Rafael Varane in the final . Simeone also had a go at referee Bjorn Kuipers as tempers boiled over during the last few minutes . Atletico were unable to hang on to the lead given to them by Diego Godin during the Lisbon final . He was one such, as was Simeone, plus Luis Enrique, Pep Guardiola (and Max Allegri at a far lower level) at four of the other eight Champions League quarter- finalists. However, as a coach, Carletto couldn’t be more different from the breed represented by Simeone, ‘Lucho’ and Guardiola. And that’s something else, other than Ancelotti’s future employment with Madrid, which is at stake this week. From the moment when elite footballers, and then run-of-the-mill players, began to earn money per season which made them absolutely financially secure for life, the worth of the coach who is only authoritarian was at an end. If you can’t ‘convince’ and ‘enlist’ your multi-millionaire squad at a club which is expected to win one, or more, of the great trophies each season, then you are dead in the water. But Guardiola, Mourinho and Simeone come from a school where they not only master the teaching, coaxing, convincing, but show ferocious authoritarian tendencies, too. ‘My way or the high way’ is something they not only dare to say to a player worth £50m-plus, they believe it’s their right. Ancelotti is built differently, having won 17 trophies as a coach seeking only intelligence, diligence and intensity of effort. He neither wants nor needs to instil fear, to make his players blind followers of a regimental doctrine — he actually treats them as responsible grown-ups. If his team act like novice kids at the Calderon on Tuesday, once again, then Ancelotti still won’t be an idiot. But an endangered species — yes."}

The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed. The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth. The green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the Royal and Ancient game. Jordan Spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta on Sunday . Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father’s words: ‘Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.’ So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. ‘He’s just a class guy in every way and it’s difficult not to root for him,’ said the leftie. Spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round . Spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day . ‘This is a momentous week in the history of our game. Along with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be.’ Sir Nick Faldo, on American television, sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week. Listen to Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: ‘Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He’s polite, he’s humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he’s obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.’ The one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Hardly a day goes by when Spieth does not Facetime Ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet. ‘I’ll finally be able to tell her yes,’ he said, smiling. When Spieth speaks about Ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice, only joy, laughter and pride. ‘I know she was watching on television and I think she’s going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,’ he said. ‘She’s going to want a present.’ Golf should not have been Spieth’s game at all. Nobody in the family plays — they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. Spieth (front) is presented with his green jacket by last year's Masters champion Bubba Watson . Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie after a sensational victory at the Masters . Perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the University of Texas after his first year. It was well-meaning. By the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the US Open, finishing 21st. But why the hurry? Why not complete his education? Throughout his life Spieth has known exactly what he wants — from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie Michael Greller. He is a maths teacher by trade but Spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway. Spieth just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13million (£8.86m) on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: ‘I don’t see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,’ it does not come across as at all boastful. Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Asked about McIlroy, as ever, he found exactly the right words: ‘He’s got four majors and numerous wins and right now that’s something I can only dream about. I’ll never hit it like he does and I have to make up for that somewhere else. But I’m looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games.’ How on earth did golf get this lucky? A sport with a fuddy-duddy, middle-aged image? Consider this: the world’s top two players have an average age seven years younger than the top two in tennis. The game is very fortunate to have a man like McIlroy. It is doubly lucky to have a personable 17-year-old in Lydia Ko at the top of the women’s game. Now Spieth has come along and golf feels truly blessed. Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . It was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the Masters that English golf had reached the end of an era, with no players ranked in the world’s top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008. But, following the encouraging events at Augusta, there should be good days ahead. Three players ranked in the top six was as many as the host nation, with Ian Poulter and Paul Casey (tied sixth) doing enough to suggest they will win at least once each before this season is out. As for joint runner-up Justin Rose, whose 14-under-par total would have won 74 out of 79 Masters, here’s a prediction: over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 US Open win. England's Justin Rose on the 18th green on Sunday after finishing tied for second on 14-under-par . Driving . No contest here. It’s the strongest part of McIlroy’s game and the weakest part of Spieth’s. McIlroy 10/10 . Spieth 5/10 . Iron play . McIlroy again has the edge, and particularly with the longer irons. McIlroy 8 .

Verdict . McIlroy 41/50 . Spieth 39/50 . It’s still McIlroy for me but we have to remember he is four years older, and Spieth has been a pro for less than two years. The exciting thing for the game, and the frightening thing for everyone else, is they’re both so young in golf terms and clearly only going to get better in years to come. McIlroy acknowledges the crowd as his bid for a first Masters title ends this year ."}

As first revealed in Football Grapevine last month, Liverpool have put a £50million price tag on Sterling if they opt to sell the 20-year-old. Should Sterling leave for one of the Barclays Premier League's big three, then the other two will focus on trying to persuade Bale to leave Madrid. A potential domestic auction could be sparked for the purchase of Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United are among those watching Sterling ahead of the summer . It could decide where Gareth Bale ends up if one club gets Sterling and the other two miss out . It promises to become a tangled transfer web. Bale is, from a playing and commercial point of view, a far 'safer bet' given his proven CV. But his fee of £75m and near £300,000-a-week wages mean his acquisition would restrict other signings under financial fair play guidelines. It's also the case that Bale may not agree to a return to any of the three Premier League clubs who can afford him. Indeed he has indicated he would like to continue at Madrid. But such has been the adverse reaction of many Madrid fans to him this season he may find it difficult to 'tough it out'. And the Spanish club may feel it is a good time to 'cash out'. As it stands Liverpool will not budge from their £100,000-a-week contract offer to England international Sterling, whose advisors believe he is worth about £150,000 in the current market. Liverpool will not budge from their £100,000-a-week contract offer to England international Sterling . Bale (left) pictured during a Real Madrid training session with Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale's £75m  fee and near £300,000-a-week wages mean his signing would restrict clubs under FFP guidelines . The stance of the Liverpool hierarchy, though, is they will not scrap their salary ladder scale for Sterling in the belief he has not yet justified moving up to their existing top bracket of £140,000-a-week that departing Steven Gerrard has been on or Luis Suarez pocketed before leaving for Barcelona. Given that he has two years left on his existing £35,000-a-week contract, the club feel  if Sterling will not agree they should cash in, even if means selling to one of the rivals - even United. Argentine Paulo Dybala,  dubbed by Palermo president Mauricio Zamparini as 'the new Sergio Aguero', is set to be on his way to the Premier League this summer. The destination depends on the outcome of the Sterling saga but both Liverpool and Arsenal are in for the 21-year-old. Paulo Dybala, dubbed 'the new Sergio Aguero', is set to be on his way to the Premier League . The destination depends on the outcome of the Sterling saga but both Liverpool and Arsenal fancy him . The 21-year-old currently plays for Palermo in Italy but could be on his way to England this summer . Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott but the player's wage demands may put off the Anfield outfit. Walcott signed a near £100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners just two years ago but is already seeking improved terms to commit himself to the club for a further five years. It remains to be seen whether Arsenal are prepared to up his wages again given his appearance record over the past two years which has been hampered by more injuries. Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott during the summer . Walcott signed a near £100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners just two years ago but could leave London . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers would see Walcott as an ideal replacement for Sterling but would only want to pay about the £100,000-per-week mark. If Walcott was still attracted to a move to Anfield, where he would command more regular football, then Arsene Wenger would make a move for Dybala. If Sterling goes and Walcott stays with the Gunners, Liverpool could then move in for the highly-rated Dybala. He is a centre forward who can also operate on the wing and is currently valued in the £15m bracket. Marcelo Bielsa has emerged as one of the front runners to succeed Sam Allardyce as West Ham manager. If, as seems certain, the Hammers do not give Allardyce a new contract in the summer then the club could turn to Argentine Bielsa, currently in charge of Marseille, who lie third in the French league in touching distance of leaders Lyon. Bielsa has an impressive CV having managed the national teams of both Argentina and Chile. Marcelo Bielsa could join the Premier League if he replaces West Ham manager Sam Allardyce . Bielsa and Hernan Crespo relax before Argentina's ill-fated 2002 World Cup campaign . Among the clubs he has managed include Athletic Bilbao in Spain, where he earned a reputation of promoting exciting football in a 3-3-3-1 formation. He is regarded as a progressive attacking coach with both Diego Simeone and Mauricio Pochettino  influenced by the 59-year-old. But the appointment of Bielsa would still be a gamble by West Ham. Allardyce may not be handed a new contract during the summer by West Ham when his current deal expires . Bielsa could replace Allardyce if his current contract is not extended by Premier League club West Ham . Over the years he has earned the nickname EL Loco - 'The Mad One'. His command of English is limited and he has little knowledge of the Premier League. The need for West Ham not to even be close to a relegation battle in their last season at the Boleyn Ground before moving to the Olympic Stadium, is obvious. Other contenders on West Ham's long list include Slaven Bilic, Rafa Benitez, Brian Laudrup, Frank Rijkaard and David Moyes. Once Manchester United have completed the long-mooted move for Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season, they will - as also predicted here - set their sights on Southampton's right back Nathaniel Clyne. It has been suggested United will offer striker Javier Hernandez, currently on loan at Real Madrid, as part of the deal to land by Clyne. But West Ham are also interested in signing Hernandez. Manchester United will set their sights on Southampton's right back Nathaniel Clyne this summer . United are set to complete their highly anticipated move for Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund . Chelsea are set to move in for Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green to act as No 2 to Thibaut Courtois with Petr Cech on his way out of Stamford Bridge. Arsenal and Liverpool have been linked with Cech. Chelsea would prefer to sell £10m-rated Cech abroad. Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain are likely to be in the market. Chelsea are set to move in for QPR goalkeeper Rob Green to replace Petr Cech at Stamford Bridge . I am hearing . While on England duty Sterling was urged by several around the camp to take a step back and consider the potential downsides of leaving Liverpool at this stage of his career, even if he will land bigger wages for the time being. I hear it was even put to Sterling that the saga now unfolding is more in the short-term interest of his advisor Aidy Ward than his long-term progression as a player. Indeed the Liverpool player should look at what happened to Shaun Wright-Phillips a decade ago. Sterling was reportedly urged by people in the England camp to sit back and think before leaving Anfield . It was in 2005 that Wright-Phillips left Manchester City - before they were big time - for Chelsea in a £21m deal, which was massive at the time. At the time 23-year-old Wright-Phillips looked as though he could be a world beater. But he was never a regular at City and his hugely promising career both at club level and England never reached its potential. Now at QPR, 33-year-old Wright-Phillips has made one Premier League appearance this season. Shaun Wright-Phillips left City for Chelsea in a £21m deal in 2005 but he never reached his potential .

Normally by then the estimated 70,000 crowd are streaming happily to the exits, savouring the day they saw Amen Corner in the flesh and clutching large shopping bags containing millions of dollars-worth of precious Masters merchandise. Given no phones are allowed in the grounds, how did word spread so quickly that the thing they had waited all day to witness was finally going to happen? They knew all right. Tiger Woods returns to action at Augusta National Golf Club to practice ahead of The Masters 2015 . Woods is given a warm welcome from the crowd and soon stops to sign autographs for some of his fans . Woods was making his first public appearance in 60 days since announcing a hiatus from golf . Woods is greeted by European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta National Golf Club . And what a reception they afforded the main man as Tiger Woods stepped back into public life after his 60-day leave of absence. A couple of minutes later, it was like he had never been away as his drive flew wickedly left and spectators were running for cover. In the end, he finished in the middle of the adjacent ninth fairway. What he would give for such luck come Thursday. He had a perfect line to the flag and duly stroked a crisp mid-iron to 10ft and rolled in the birdie putt. Then it was time to practice his chipping from each side of the green — and everyone’s attention went up a notch. After his well-documented chipping problems in January, all eyes are being trained on how he copes with the infamous tight lies at Augusta. Woods practised to spots where he knows the flags will be located over the four days of the tournament. His action looked smooth and confident. He hit 16 chips from the front and right of the green and most finished close to the tee pegs that signified the imaginary holes. None were chunked. So it continued, in positive fashion. At the par-five second, he was putting for an eagle three. At the difficult par-three fourth, he positively skipped off the tee as his long iron finished tap-in distance away. After nine holes where the ball was struck with impressive authority, Woods decided to call it a day. Nothing, of course, can be read into what happens in practice, but one thing is for certain. At this place where he can draw upon so many happy memories, Woods is going to have an awful lot of goodwill to help him along. By contrast, Rory McIlroy practised at the other end of the day. In the past, Masters Monday was one where he would seek out an experienced hand for wisdom. Now he was the one passing on the insight, as he strolled to the tee with British Amateur champion, Bradley Neil. The promising 19-year-old from Blairgowrie considers driving the ball his strongest suit and was understandably pleased to find the middle of the first fairway. ‘I was feeling really happy and Rory steps up and crunches it 40 yards past me,’ said Neil. ‘I just thought: “Phew, he’s good, isn’t he?”’ Just days until 25-year-old McIlroy’s tilt at the career Grand Slam and the thing that struck Neil was that you would have struggled to tell who was the amateur here to soak up the experience and who was the history man.

Woods hits an impressive chip shot on to the putting green at Augusta National Golf Club on Monday . ‘It just tells you how strong he is mentally when he can be so calm,’ said Neil. ‘He’s got this chance to join the greats and yet talking to him you would have never known it.’ What did they talk about? ‘A lot of small talk actually,’ said Neil, who is trying to become the first British amateur since Peter McEvoy way back in 1978 to make the cut. ‘There’s only six years between us, so we talked about girls and things. Strangely, his life seemed to be a lot quieter than mine.’ Plan A called for the pair to play nine holes but Neil got the bonus of a further nine as McIlroy decided to play a full round. Perhaps he had one eye on the weather forecast, which is dire enough to wonder whether there will be any practice rounds at all. The highlight of Neil’s round came early, when he holed a 90-yard pitch shot at the second for an eagle three. McIlroy could not stop laughing. Two weeks ago during a private practice session here, Neil had done exactly the same thing. McIlroy, who was also on a reconnaissance mission, was standing on the adjacent third tee at the time. ‘Do yourself a favour Bradley, and don’t ever go for this green in two,’ said Rory. On the 18th, McIlroy finished in the style he will be looking for come Sunday. A perfect drive was followed by a typically towering iron shot that finished just 10ft from the hole and he knocked in the birdie putt. And so, late in the day, the attention switched to Tiger, where the crowd spoke as one. They were pleased to see him back.

McIlroy and amateur Bradley Neil (left) practice their short game on the green at Augusta on Monday . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and will be keen to return to form as soon as possible . EUROPEANS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND . Perhaps someone will do a television mini series and call it Modern Masters Mysteries. Part one would be what the heck has happened to the Europeans at Augusta. And part two would be how left handers have managed to produce 50 per cent of the champions over the last dozen years while comprising barely three per cent of the field. When Jose Maria Olazabal collected the second of his two green jackets in such emotional circumstances in 1999, it marked the 11th victory by a European in the 19 editions since Seve Ballesteros became the first in 1980. There has not been one since. During this millennium, the Europeans have won four US Opens, produced five Open champions, while there have been four triumphs at the US PGA Championship. They have also won six of the eight Ryder Cups staged during that time frame. But at the major where they used to enjoy the most success? There have barely been any serious contenders, let alone newcomers to the champions' locker room. Lee Westwood was runner-up to Phil Mickelson on one occasion while the Swede Jonas Blixt finished joint second last year. That is it in terms of top two finishes. Why the dramatic shift in fortunes? As Rory McIlroy pointed out, part of the explanation has to come down to the fabulous Augusta combination of Tiger and Phil, who have won seven Masters between them. Other than that, it is a hard one to fathom. As the successes in the other majors showed, there has been no shortage of quality. While the Europeans have been shut out, the left handers have prospered like never before. When the Canadian Mike Weir won the 2003 Masters he was only the second lefty to win any major (Bob Charles, with his 1963 Open triumph, was the other) let alone the Masters. Since then, Mickelson has weighed in with three victories before giving way to Bubba Watson, who has won two of the last three, making it six victories out of the last 12. It used to be said the perfect shape shot for Augusta was a high draw but the lefties can better that since their equivalent is a high fade, and the ball always spins more and lands softer when the shot is a fade. When you are dealing with the fine margins that prevail at Augusta National, that is a considerable plus. There is also Paul McGinley's geekish theory that the modern three-piece ball is harder to keep in the air when hit with a draw, thereby hurting the right handers at the Masters. My own theory? Two left handers with perfect games for Augusta just happened to come along at almost the same time. Both have the power and the touch that is so vital to success in these parts. But when Mickelson and Watson are past their best, do not be surprised if we go back to the Masters being dominated by those on the right.

It is a week since I criticised Newcastle United’s goalkeeper for appearing to congratulate Jermain Defoe at half-time during the Wear-Tyne derby after the Sunderland striker beat him with a brilliant volley. I’m still struggling to work out why Krul did what he did. I have nothing against Krul, personally or professionally. He’s been one of the few players who have performed consistently for Newcastle in recent seasons, which led to him being part of Holland’s World Cup squad last summer. Newcastle keeper Tim Krul  congratulated Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal at half-time . Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports . But coming together with an opponent and smiling after he’s scored against you in a match of such importance? No, I’m sorry. I can’t understand why any player would feel the need to do that. At the end of the game? That’s not an issue — there is no more appropriate place for sportsmanship. Think about the iconic image of Pele and Bobby Moore swapping shirts after Brazil had beaten England 1-0 at the 1970 World Cup or how two boxers will embrace after they have gone the distance — that is fantastic to see. When Liverpool beat Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-final at Anfield, the first thing I did at the final whistle was go over to see John Terry to offer my respects for how well he’d played over the two legs. Would I have told him that at half-time with the game in the balance? No chance! We were talking about this subject at Sky on Monday morning. I bumped into former England rugby centre Will Greenwood and he told me a story about the end of the Rugby World Cup final in 2003, when Australia’s Elton Flatley scored a penalty with the last kick to take the game into extra-time. Pele (left) and Bobby Moore hug and swap shirts after the 1970 World Cup match between Brazil and England . Elton Flatley (left) levels the 2003 Rugby World Cup final with the last kick of normal time . Luis Garcia celebrates his winner for Liverpool against Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-finals . Will said he went up to Flatley after that successful conversion and said to him: ‘Well done — you’ve got balls as big as houses for that.’ That is great sportsmanship but I’m not sure I could have done the same if I’d seen the World Cup ripped out of my hands. Andrew Flintoff, who famously went to console Brett Lee at the end of an Ashes Test in 2005, joined in the debate on Twitter. He clearly felt I had been harsh on Krul and he told me cricketers applaud the opposition batsman when he passes 50 or 100, quite often with a handshake. That’s all well and good. But will a batsman walk up to a bowler and pat him on the back after having his stumps uprooted? We have never seen that happen nor are we likely to. You don’t congratulate the opposition at a time when your team have been put on the back foot. I carried that approach during my career. There were more talented players than me but I had desire, focus and would never lose my intensity. I never, for instance, ever considered shaking hands or hugging an opponent in the tunnel before a match. The attitude stemmed from my childhood. Growing up as an Evertonian, I would work myself into a frenzy in the week before a derby match. I despised Liverpool then and I wanted the players who I supported to feel exactly the same way. Andrew Flintoff (right) consoles Brett Lee after England beat Australia in the second Ashes Test in 2005 . Defoe (centre) shoots and scores the opening goal on Sunday at the Stadium of Light . Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . If, then, I’d seen Neville Southall put an arm around Ian Rush’s shoulder after he’d scored a goal, I’d have been devastated. I took that approach when I ended up playing against Everton. Put it this way — I couldn’t have shared a joke with Tim Cahill if he’d scored 30 seconds before half-time like Defoe. I appreciate some people reading this will feel it was extreme but that’s how I operated. Gary Neville has told me regularly that if I ever want to go into coaching or management, I will have to lower my tolerance levels since modern players are different and it isn’t worth falling out with them over certain things. I’m not saying my way is right or wrong but to be at my best I needed to be tense and wound up. If I thought to myself I needed to say ‘Well done’ to someone I was in direct competition with, I wouldn’t have been thinking about winning the game in which I was involved. That wasn’t me. Gerard Houllier was a manager who held similar views. He once saw one of our foreign players hugging an opponent in the tunnel before a game at Anfield and went berserk afterwards. ‘I never want to see that again from any of you — you are going to war with them,’ he said. ‘Save the hugging for in the bar afterwards.’ Carragher (left) argues with Gary Neville during a 2010 league match between Liverpool and United . Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier holds the FA Cup aloft after winning the trophy in Cardiff in 2001 . Houllier even told us before the FA Cup final in 2001 that he didn’t want us looking into the stand to see our families; given that I grew up watching players make the long walk at Wembley while waving to the crowd, that was quite a statement. But do you know something? I loved that. There is a time and a place for showing mutual respect and it is after the final whistle has gone and you are in the bar afterwards. Before that, you have business to take care of and that should be the priority — that’s why I felt so strongly about Krul. Others, of course, will take a different view and say I have been too harsh. I respect that. It doesn’t mean to say, though, that I can understand it. Underdogs City need show of strength . It is almost four years to the day since Manchester City struck a huge psychological blow in the battle to be top dogs in town. On April 16, 2011, Yaya Toure’s goal knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup and set his club on a path of sustained success. It says everything for what was achieved back then at Wembley that City won six of the eight derbies that followed. Even when United won the title in 2013, there was a feeling that it was down to unrest behind the scenes with Roberto Mancini rather than the brilliance of Sir Alex Ferguson’s squad. Player for player, City’s quality was superior to their old rivals. Manchester City's Yaya Toure celebrates after scoring against United in the 2011 FA Cup semi-finals . Vincent Kompany (centre) lifts the trophy after Manchester City won the Premier League in 2012 . There is a similar feel about Sunday’s meeting at Old Trafford but this time City are vulnerable. United, having won their last five Barclays Premier League fixtures, are firm favourites and will feel confident of finally ending their neighbours’ title aspirations. If Louis van Gaal’s side win, the ramifications for City could be serious. There is no doubt United will spend big again in the summer and, with the full implications of Financial Fair Play kicking in, they might be able to recruit the players that City need. United will certainly fancy their chances but they should not take anything for granted. When the teams come out, City will still have the best striker on show in Sergio Aguero, the best midfielder in Toure, the most creative talent in David Silva and the finest defender in Vincent Kompany. Sergio Aguero (centre) in action for Manchester City against Crystal Palace on Monday night . Wayne Rooney (right) on the ball as Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal takes training on Friday . That quartet have not been at their best this season but, during the last four years, they have provided the best spine in the Premier League. They aren’t the problem at City — it’s the players around them who need to be improved. If City want to send a message to United — and for next season — Aguero, Silva, Kompany and Toure will have to show what we know they are capable of. Van Gaal is starting to put his stamp on United — they have improved since the switch to 4-3-3 — and has big ambitions. City have relished having United in their shade. To keep them there, they need a show of strength."}

Don’t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year. It is not uncommon to see Arsenal finish a season with a string of good results. Usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the Barclays Premier League. The same thing has happened this year. Chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before Christmas. Arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals last week . Alexis Sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for Arsenal at Wembley . With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won’t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won’t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could ‘smell’ something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal’s board don’t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn’t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid’s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal’s money like it’s his own, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be stressed, are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season, when they only just held off Everton’s challenge to finish fourth. But there is still room for improvement. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at Wembley last Saturday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on Friday . Results have been impressive since David Ospina replaced Wojciech Szczesny, who had failed to show the required consistency. Ospina has played 12 Premier League games; Arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets, but Wenger still needs to buy a new No 1 if they are to be title challengers. Petr Cech would be an ideal candidate to come in. Laurent Koscielny has steadied things in defence, with Arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he’s played since January 1 but, to progress, Wenger needs another top centre back. Gabriel Paulista arrived in the New Year but it seems it was to provide cover for Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Francis Coquelin has added bite to the midfield, but would Arsenal have enough to challenge next season if Coquelin is their anchor and Mikel Arteta is his back up? No. Why doesn’t he go for Paul Pogba, who looks set to leave Juventus? Wenger spent £42m on Mesut Ozil, so why not spend the same and more on Pogba. If they needed to sign Ozil two years ago, their need to sign Pogba this summer is even greater. Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is 29 and at the peak of his powers. He would be ideal at the heart of the defence. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina pictured during a training session at London Colney last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech warms up before Saturday's Premier League clash against Manchester United . Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, has provided a focal point up front. I like Giroud. He is an under-rated striker and, had he not missed three months with a broken ankle, his tally would be more than 14; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes, the second best rate in the Premier League. Giroud is one of a number of good options Wenger has up front. Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant, while Danny Welbeck has played his part, but that should not stop Wenger looking to improve on what he has got. If a forward with the class of players he has had before, such as Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka, comes on the market, Wenger would have to move for him. Imagine what Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero or Karim Benzema could do for Arsenal? I’m not saying Arsenal are getting to the levels of ‘The Invincibles’ but their form has me thinking they are getting closer. The 2-0 win at Manchester City in January could be a turning point. They made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open. Hopefully we will see more of this. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at Wembley . Danny Welbeck (left) looks to evade the challenge of Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu (centre) and Alex Pearce . Of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago, and Wenger has not had a smooth ride. Fans turned on him after they lost at Stoke — and after the Champions League defeat to Monaco — leading to talk about Jurgen Klopp coming in. But some perspective is needed. Wenger has done a good job keeping Arsenal consistently in the top four — all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between — and by the end of next month, they could have won back-to-back FA Cups. How could you then get rid of Wenger? So one question would need asking: what are they waiting for? Both Manchester clubs will spend in the summer, but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix. City’s squad is old and needs big investment, while United will have the complication of being back in Europe. Wenger, then, could use the next window to call it on. The message it would send out to his players, fans and, most significantly, their rivals would be huge. It would let everyone know they were launching an all-out assault on the title. They would have to be taken seriously. Beating Chelsea on Sunday won’t alter things in the short term, but it will offer belief that Arsenal can challenge next season. What they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make. Finding some special players could transform them. Borussia Dortmund head coach Jurgen Klopp celebrates after beating SC Paderborn last weekend . Wenger applauds the Arsenal fans after his side booked their place in the FA Cup final . Big guns missed out on a Fab freebie . Full marks to Aston Villa. They are a side rejuvenated by Tim Sherwood and absolutely deserved to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Jack Grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role Fabian Delph played was just as important; his aggression, energy and left foot gives Villa balance in their midfield. Liverpool couldn’t cope with his aggression. Earlier this season, Delph was lauded for committing his future to Villa even when their position in the Barclays Premier League was threatened. He signed a four-year deal, which showed his character could never be called into question. What can be called into question, however, is the wisdom of some other clubs in the Premier League. Fabian Delph (right) celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against Liverpool in the FA Cup semis . Delph, do not forget, was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young England international for free. No doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder, to go with the ones they signed last summer, and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we don’t have enough English players playing for top sides competing in Europe. There will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy English players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings. The Delph situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense. He is now Villa’s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months. His progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the England squad and if he can add more goals to his game — like the one he scored against Liverpool — he could reach a very high level. Delph slots the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Villa's 2-1 victory at Wembley . If Delph does maintain his improvement, inevitably clubs will come looking at him. But if they want him, it will cost. For reasons only they know, they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing. Their loss is most certainly Villa’s gain."}

Yet its rise was not because PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title since 2008, ending Ajax's four-year reign. It was down to Memphis Depay, who scored his 20th goal of the season to confirm their 22nd championship in Holland. It turned heads at Manchester United. Yet Jim Lawlor, their chief scout, had been doing his homework long before Depay reached the total which Louis van Gaal holds in such high regard. PSV Eindhoven's Memphis Depay celebrates with the trophy after securing the Eredivisie championship . Depay (left) and PSV team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum (right) celebrate with the Eredivisie trophy . PSV manager Phillip Cocu (left) and top goalscorer Depay (right) clinched the title with three games to spare . 20 – Memphis Depay (winger) 19 – Luuk de Jong (striker) 16 – Michiel Kramer (striker) 14 – Michael de Leeuw (striker) 14 – Mark Uth (striker) The manager announced in February he lacked a striker who could score 20 goals. If a 21-year-old can do it from the wing in 27 appearances, albeit in Holland rather than England, is that not worth a £25million investment? Manchester United think so, and they are not alone. From 'official talks' with Liverpool, to 'discussions' with Paris Saint-Germain, to a not-so-secret meeting in Manchester. Depay has been busy, and no wonder. He is the Eredivisie's top goalscorer, without even being PSV's main forward. His 20 goals have contributed 12 points, which just so happens to be the difference between them and second-placed Ajax. Yet not many people had heard of Depay, particularly before the 2014 World Cup, so why the sudden case of rubbing hands together? How Depay could look for Manchester United should he make his £25m move to Old Trafford this summer . Depay pictured in action during PSV's title-winning victory against Heerenveen last weekend at home . Depay is the Eredivisie's top goalscorer with 20, without even being PSV's main forward in their attack . Depay was understood to have held a meeting in Manchester  as he nears his £25m move with Louis van Gaal . First, his background. He has 'dream chaser' tattooed across his chest, and 'successful' inked on the inside of his lower lip. Joining the iconic Manchester United brand would not contradict either, particularly given his difficult childhood. As a four-year-old, his parents separated. In 2012, after turning 18, he dropped 'Depay' from the back of his shirt as a snub to his absent father. Raised by his mother in the southern Dutch town of Moordrecht, he grew up in 'a small village where there is not much to do', so says Gigi, a childhood friend of Depay's. Yet some of the greatest footballers were created in such places. Take Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, for example. He grew up in poverty-stricken rural Chile in a mining town called Tocopilla – literal meaning Devil's Corner. With Depay poised to join the Barclays Premier League, talk is of him being paid the same as Sanchez – £130,000 a week. Yet the man handed his Holland debut just 18 months ago by Van Gaal remains relatively unknown. The manager sees something in him. As a player, Depay can be used as a makeshift forward, and has been likened to Cristiano Ronaldo by PSV manager Phillip Cocu and Ajax great Ronald de Boer. He's fast-paced, tricky, and physical. A left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot – not unlike his counterpart and compatriot Arjen Robben. His specialty is free-kicks. Five of his 20 goals were from dead-ball situations – his latest against Heerenveen seven days ago, when PSV were crowned champions with three games to spare. His talents aren't new to those in Holland, however. Nobody in Eredivisie completed more dribbles (101) last season, and he created the second-most chances (87), too. Depay has 'dream chaser' tattooed across his chest, and 'successful' inked on the inside of his lower lip . Depay celebrates with his Holland team-mate Arjen Robben during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Memphis, a right-footed left-winger, celebrates with his counterpart Robben, a left-footed right-winger . It is exactly what Manchester United need, given they have created fewer chances (332) than Queens Park Rangers (342) and Tottenham Hotspur (352) this season. It led to his potential being recognised by Europe's heavyweights during the summer. Called up, the then-20-year-old's goal against Australia made him the youngest Dutch scorer in the history of the World Cup, taking over from Boudewijn Zenden at France '98. That was Depay's first goal in Brazil, before his second against Chile – the same total England's squad managed as a collective in Group D. When Holland used a 4-3-3 formation, he got the nod to join Robben and Robin van Persie in a three-pronged attack. He had four shots, with 100 per cent accuracy, and scored two of them. Already a disciple of Louis van Gaal's philosophy, it seems. Compare Depay to Manchester United's other forwards – Wayne Rooney, Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson – and he blitzes the averages of the rest. He scores a goal every 115.2 minutes (with Van Persie nearest on 119.3). He creates a chance every 41.9 minutes (with Rooney nearest on 62.5). He makes a run every 14.9 minutes (with Rooney, again, nearest on 37.1). And so on. How Depay could look for Manchester United (left) and the winger playing last week for PSV (right) Old Trafford forwards Wayne Rooney (from left to right), Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson . And yet, he is not the complete package. Not quite. He has been labelled greedy by some, averaging a shot every 19.9 minutes, having had 277 in 79 appearances in Eredivisie in the last three seasons. Even Gareth Bale, the supposed ball-hog at Real Madrid, averages fewer (24.3 minutes per shot). As is understandable with young players, his decision-making leaves a lot to be desired, too. He needs teaching, perhaps by his former national manager in Manchester. Depay wouldn't be the first to leave PSV for the Premier League, or even Old Trafford for that matter, after all. Thursday marked 14 years since Sir Alex Ferguson signed Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV for a then-British transfer record of £19m. The striker went on to make 150 appearances, scoring 95 goals, averaging one every 128.2 minutes. A success. Depay wouldn't be the first to leave PSV for the Premier League, or Manchester United for that matter . Ruud van Nistelrooy (left) joined Manchester United from PSV, while Mateja Kezman (right) joined Chelsea . Three years after one PSV great arrived, another followed. Yet Mateja Kezman had little impact in the Premier League with Chelsea. He made just 25 appearances, scoring four goals with no assists, averaging one every 184.5 minutes. A dud. Depay could do worse than join the project at Manchester United. The Premier League can be as unforgiving as it is rewarding when it comes to potential-laden youngsters. They more often than not get found out, as £20m Brazilian Anderson was. Yet Depay can strive for great things, if his statistics are anything to go by, and putting it on the pitch at Old Trafford could be the next challenge for the 'dream chaser'. Depay could soon be joining the Premier League as he looks set to sign for Manchester United for £25m ."}

Jack Grealish was fantastic but Fabian Delph was the best player on the pitch. On Saturday, I said his battle with Jordan Henderson would be key to the game. There’s no doubt who won that one. Delph was different class. He put in an all-action display and ran the game. He looked like the player we all felt he could become when he emerged at Leeds. He was outstanding.

They are the form team down there right now. When you’re in a relegation scrap, nothing boosts your confidence quite like goals. That’s why Leicester have been able to drag themselves off the bottom of the table. They have scored 10 in their last four, including three at Tottenham in a game they were unlucky to lose 4-3. Now they have won three games in a row - a winning streak only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can beat. They have good pace up front with Jamie Vardy, and Leonardo Ulloa finally found his shooting boots with a goal against Swansea. The key for Leicester now is that, of their six remaining games, four of them are at home. That home advantage could be the difference between staying up or going down. Leonardo Ulloa celebrates with Leicester team-mate Esteban Cambiasso during the Foxes win over Swansea . Que sera, sera . Of course, for sentimental reasons I wanted Steven Gerrard and Liverpool to get to the final. What better way for one of Liverpool’s greatest ever players to depart the club than with an FA Cup win? It is a shame he won’t be there but he has probably achieved more at Liverpool than he would ever have dreamed of. And if there’s anybody who thinks about the team rather than himself, it’s Stevie. He will be devastated not to make the final but for the club’s sake, not his. Steven Gerrard looks dejected after Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday . Liverpool captain Gerrard will be devastated at not reaching the FA Cup final but for the club's sake, not his . Winning the FA Cup would have been the perfect send off for Gerrard who is leaving Liverpool for LA Galaxy . Chelsea just do what's needed . 1 - Chelsea have lost just one of their last 13 Premier League home games against Man Utd (3-2 in Oct 2012), winning eight and drawing four . It's difficult to be critical of a side like Chelsea. They have an incredible record at home and an uncanny ability to win the big games. That’s exactly what happened against Man United on Saturday. People say it was a tactical masterplan to play Kurt Zouma in midfield to stop Marouane Fellaini. I’m not so sure. Yes, Fellaini has been effective in recent weeks but I don’t think we’ve got to the stage where he needs to be man-marked. Chelsea are a good enough team to beat United without resorting to that. But you cannot argue with the results. Chelsea have developed a ruthless, efficient style. Since losing to Spurs on New Year’s Day they are unbeaten in the league. In their last two games they have had three shots on target. Two of them have gone in and they have won both games 1-0. That’s how to grind out a title. The United game was Jose Mourinho’s 102nd clean sheet out of 190 games in the Premier League. He knows exactly what’s needed to bring home the trophies. No wonder Roman Abramovich looked so delighted after the final whistle. Kurt Zouma (right) and Marouane Fellaini battle for the ball during Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Man United .

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich shows his delight in the stands at Stamford Bridge during Saturday's win . Pressure's on for Arsenal . I’m sure most neutrals wanted to see Arsenal play Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and plenty of Arsenal fans will be happy to see Villa there instead. But they will have to be careful. Against Wigan and Hull last year, and Reading this time around, Arsenal have made hard work of these games. The pressure will be all on them and they will have to compete with the energy of that Villa midfield. It will certainly make for another absorbing final. Arsenal celebrate during the win over Reading but will have to be careful against Villa in the FA Cup final . Burnley must keep believing . April 25 - Leicester (H) May 2 - West Ham (A) May 9 - Hull (A) May 16 - Stoke (H) May 24 - Aston Villa (A) For Sean Dyche and his side, their season starts now. Burnley have been on a poor run and another defeat this weekend has added to their worries. They have only scored one goal in their last seven games, although that was a significant winner against Manchester City. But that is a desperate drought that has seen them sink right to the bottom of the table. Their top scorer Danny Ings has not scored since February though it has been difficult for him — I’m sure he’s got other things on his mind with so much speculation about his future. He has had a decent season but he has suffered from a lack of support and that is a problem. Burnley's top scorer Danny Ings has not scored since February and has not suffered from a lack of support . Only two other Burnley players have scored more than twice all season - George Boyd and Ashley Barnes with five each. It’s hard to see where their next goal is coming from. But for Dyche the fixture list has been kind. Some of their relegation rivals have still got to face the top sides but the highest-placed team Burnley have to face are Stoke in ninth. Dyche and his team only have five games left but there’s no reason why they can’t get something from each one of them. Burnley players look dejected following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Everton and are not bottom of the table . Awards season . 4 - Kane is only the fourth Tottenham player to score 20+ goals in a Premier League season after Gareth Bale, Jurgen Klinsmann and Teddy Sheringham. I have said throughout the second half of the season that the Player of the Year award will be between Eden Hazard and Harry Kane. Diego Costa, Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez have all done well but those two have been consistently excellent. Over the last six games there’s no doubt Hazard’s performances should have that contest wrapped up. He has been nothing short of brilliant in the games that really matter. Kane has been the best thing about Tottenham’s season. He has rescued their front line and I would be amazed if he doesn’t win Young Player of the Year. I prefer watching attacking players doing exciting things and he has done that all season. He came from nowhere and he has been one of the stories of the year.

The Barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. TAKING THE BISCUIT . Just a few days ago an old friend of mine Jimmy Carter, the winger who played for Millwall, Liverpool and Arsenal not the US President, visited Barnet and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office. After training, to help me get rid of them, I decided to give some out to our players. The first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of PG Tips and a chat. I asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on, around the group. I kept repeating it, each time: Take one and pass it on, take one and pass it on. One player didn’t want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on. Martin Allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. I stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he hadn’t taken a biscuit. This was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach’s direction. I didn’t tell them to eat it - I told them to take one and pass the pack on. The other six were looking at their biscuits waiting for the go ahead. I passed the packet back to the player and he now took his biscuit. I let them all know they could eat if they like, and if not return it to my desk, and shook all their hands as they left the room. When it comes to this crucial stage in the season, you need all your troops ready to follow orders. IT’S A ZAYN IF THEY’RE NOT PULLING IN ONE DIRECTION . At whatever level it’s always important to have all your players going in One Direction. Just like the band, if you’ve got one person wanting to go a different way, do a different thing, something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken. At the business end of the season, it is so important that they are working as a team. People have to do their jobs; defending set plays, defensive shape when you’re attacking, working up and down the pitch. You need good captains and leaders within your group. People like John Terry, who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that Chelsea squad follows Jose Mourinho’s guidance out on the pitch. It is One Direction, or no direction. Captain John Terry works hard to ensure everybody at Chelsea is heading in the same direction . ON THE PERIPHERY . Having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important. But the players out of the team, on the periphery, can lose you matches. Negative body language, people unable to cope with not playing, disruptive comments, and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad. The man-management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the UEFA Pro Licence or courses put on by the Football Association. I’ve spent the last three-and-a-half years working with a guy called Rob Northfield, who runs Inspire based up in Harrogate, on man-management skills for my players, my staff and of course myself. He deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies. Allen won a championship with Gillingham and is hoping to soon do the same with Barnet . Since then, I have one championship in the bag at Gillingham and hopefully by the end of this month would’ve bagged a second. Without Rob Northfields this would not have happened. Mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side. He knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him. Players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing. Allen’s Analysis… . One person I keep hearing about… Gary Rowett Gary Rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at Birmingham City. He has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the Championship. He did a tremendous job at Burton Albion and back then there was no doubt in my mind, having played against his teams over the last couple of years, he would go on to manage at a much higher level. He must've asked me at least one hundred questions when my Gillingham team visited Burton the week after winning the championship. He was like Bamber Gascoigne, the old University Challenge presenter - non-stop firing questions at me. He was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with Gillingham from a team that had previously been mid-table. For me, he’s heading for the top. Allen believes Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is going to go all the way to the top . One thing I’d change about… perceptions in football . At Barnet last summer, I found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people. I took on Jon Nurse, born in Barbados, as a player-coach. I was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother. On top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games, winning a promotion, the FA Trophy and been in numerous playoff finals. He also has a UEFA B coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called Love The Ball. I took on another player-coach, goalkeeper Graham Stack, an Irishman, who has four impeccably behaved children, who runs the Graham Stack Soccer Academy for youngsters and a high-end executive travel company with his wife, who can build patios and brick walls alongside his UEFA B coaching licence. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Graham Stack has been working alongside Allen as a coach at Barnet . Then I was introduced to a young man called Omar Yabroudi who moved to London from Dubai and wanted to be my analyst. He works hard and has been a real help. He works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly. We have a 23-year-old female physiotherapist, Jade Cook, who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time. She is calm, quiet, well-organised, disciplined, structured and I am very happy all the players are being so well looked after. I did not take on a Barbadian, an Irishman, an Emirati or a female because of their nationality, or skin colour or gender. I took them on because they’re good at their jobs, they are good people, with good personalities and they have excellent characters. I’m very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the Premier League. Without them we would not have been top of the Conference for so long. The big issue… England coming out of the dark ages. When I was a little boy watching England versus Poland in the front room with my dad, the amazing Jan Tomaszewski, who Brian Clough called a ‘clown in gloves,’ stopped England qualifying for the 1974 World Cup with his heroic performance in goal. The panel of pundits, all those years ago, said we’ve got to change. We’re not playing the type of football other countries play; our children don’t get coached to be good technical players like other nations. Over the years I’ve heard it time and time again. The same old stuff. Especially over the last few years with the Spanish dominance, people asking why we have not got the Iniestas and Xavis of this world on our shores. Allen believes Greg Dyke is the man to help find the Iniestas and Xavis of the English game . The Football Association’s technical director now, Dan Ashworth, appointed by my old chairman Greg Dyke, is a forward-thinker who can finally make some changes. He may never have played a professional game in his life, but at West Bromwich Albion he implemented a modern football structure at the club, where the manager does not have to deal with everything, where other departments and professionals are involved. Greg Dyke speaks to Premier League chief Richard Scudamore ahead of his FA council meeting . Ashworth can handle himself well. At a League Managers Association training day a couple of years, at a hotel near Reading, one Sunday afternoon, speaking just before Fabio Capello, Ashworth faced a roomful of sceptical, old-fashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward. The gave him a torrid time with their caveman-like mentality that the manager should run the whole club. He handled the room carefully and skilfully and I think Greg Dyke has put English football into the right hands. He is the right man to take England back for their second World Cup win."}

He tried to talk but his mind was elsewhere. He was waiting for the end to come. At 4.15pm a bell rang out. McCoy did not need to be reminded for whom it tolled. He knew it tolled for him. He obeyed the signal for the jockeys to mount. He walked alongside Box Office, the final ride of his astonishing career, and then clambered into the saddle. The tears streamed down his face but he pulled down his goggles so that nobody would see. He rode out on to the course. McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . The 40-year-old received a guard of honour before receiving the Champion Jockey trophy . He knew this would be a strange day. He was aware it was being styled as a joyous celebration of the career of the greatest jump jockey there has ever been. ‘The Champ, The Finale’ it said on the front of Sandown Park’s raceday programme. But McCoy knew, too, that, for him, the day of his retirement would be a day filled with sadness and dread. Earlier in the afternoon, he had ridden Mr Mole into third place in the bet365 AP McCoy Celebration Chase. Now, he had one last shot at giving Sandown’s biggest crowd for a decade what they wanted by riding a winner. So one last time, he rode a mount around the Surrey track, racing the rest of the field and one of the red-and-blue trains that hurry along behind the tree line on the far side of the course, towards Waterloo. A film script would have delivered his 4,358th winner but sport is more capricious than celluloid. And so it delivered an irony. The last race of McCoy’s career, the bet365 Handicap Hurdle, was won by Richard Johnson, 15 times a runner-up to McCoy in the jockeys’ championship. The two men are great friends but this was one small act of revenge for 20 years of being a bridesmaid. McCoy, 40, finished third. He pushed Box Office all the way to the line and took the congratulations of his fellow jockeys as they and their horses milled around him. He was about to head towards the winner’s enclosure when he was ushered back along the track. Now the emotion really bit. McCoy and Box Office trotted back in front of the stands packed with 18,000 cheering fans. One man and his horse. There was something wonderfully moving about the tribute. Maybe it was just its simplicity. An old gunslinger was riding off into the sunset. The champion jockey was joined by his wife Channelle, daughter Eve and son Archie on his last day of racing . In the winner’s enclosure, he dismounted amid scarcely controlled chaos. A couple of photographers had climbed the little horse chestnut tree that stands outside the weighing room and perched in its lower branches to get a better shot. A television reporter put his microphone under McCoy’s nose and paid fulsome tribute to him, telling him he wanted to thank him not just for today but the last 20 years. McCoy could only nod. He could not speak any more. All day, it was impossible to get away from those themes of joy and despair. Everyone wanted McCoy to be happy, to depart gladly from his glory game, but everywhere he went, he looked as if he were being led to the gallows. The Irish jockey (left) was unable to leave on a winning note as he raced on the aptly named Box Office . It was like that when the rest of the jockeys who have trailed in his wake for so long formed an honour guard as he walked into the parade ring to be presented with the Champion Jockey Trophy for the 20th consecutive time, by Ian Wright, one of McCoy’s Arsenal heroes. Some of the jockeys were in tears. McCoy looked grim. Forget all the talk of new beginnings and how this would be a brave new phase of his life. McCoy was having none of it. He did not try to put a brave face on what was happening. He did not even pretend he was thinking about new beginnings. His mind told him just one thing – this is the end, beautiful friend. It has been beautiful, too. It has broken bones in almost every part of his body and it has demanded continuous sacrifice but it has brought him unparalleled success and universal respect. He stands alongside men like Andy Murray, Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins as the greatest modern British sportsmen. It is difficult to set the parameters for greatness, particularly when trying to measure a jockey against heroes of other sports. But whatever criteria you use, it is hard to outstrip McCoy for the relentlessness of his domination. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . Michael Jordan is probably the greatest star basketball ever and he won six NBA championships in two bursts of three consecutive titles. Wayne Gretzky was the best player in ice hockey for many years and still holds 60 NHL records but he won the Stanley Cup just four times. Of the greats of individual modern sport, Tiger Woods stayed at the top of his sport for 545 consecutive weeks and Roger Federer for 237 weeks. McCoy stayed at the top for 1,040 consecutive weeks. It is hard to call an end to a career like that — and in the 11 weeks since he announced this would be his last season, he has never tried to disguise the pain. Time and again in interviews on Saturday, he said the thing uppermost in his mind. ‘If I could say one thing to all the guys in the weighing room,’ he said, ‘it would be to enjoy it as much as they can because the end doesn’t half come around very quick.’ Sandown Park was packed with punters and the media who were eager to give him a memorable send off . McCoy, who was named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2010 after he finally won the Grand National, was given plenty of opportunities to talk about the benefits a life without racing might bring. He did not take any of them. After his final race, he was ushered into a white marquee, flanked by O’Neill and the owner, JP McManus, for a final press conference. He looked blank. He looked stunned. His voice was flat. He tried humour. Someone ventured his record of 20 championships in a row and 4,348 winners over jumps would never be broken. ‘All records are broken,’ McCoy said. ‘I hope I’m dead when it happens. It’ll take someone at least 20 years so I’ll probably be in a home by then, or doting.’ But most of the time, he did not attempt levity. He said he wished he could start his racing career all over again — ‘I have got nothing to look forward to now.’ O’Neill nudged him. ‘Apart from my wife and kids,’ McCoy added, hurriedly. ‘Jonjo got in just in time then.’ Crowds wee packed into Sandown to wish McCoy well in his final two rides . A few years ago, McCoy talked about the realities that his wife had had to live with as the partner of a man so utterly dedicated to a dangerous sport. He recalled the moment they had been for a fertility check and were told that McCoy’s habit of taking hot baths every day to sweat weight off had made his sperm count abnormally low. ‘Chanelle was busy putting things into perspective,’ McCoy remembered. ‘“Anthony is a jockey, he rides horses at 30 miles per hour over fences every day of the week, two ambulances follow him around while he works, he could come home in a wheelchair one day. That would be an issue. This is not an issue”.’ Soon after that, they started IVF treatment and in 2007, Chanelle gave birth to a daughter, Eve. On Saturday, as McCoy carried the Champion Jockey Trophy around the parade ring at Sandown, Eve ran after him in her little white dress, outside the cluster of photographers who tracked his every move. ‘Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,’ she kept shouting, treating it as a game. Her daddy did not hear her above the din. Now, though, the din has gone. McCoy is pictured in third during his last ever ride in his career at Sandown on Saturday . The Irish jockey waves goodbye to the thousands of fans after an emotional day ."}

Scroll down for video . Self-styled 'anarchist libertarian' squatters have set up camp in one of London's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading 'Homes for all' One of the banners read, 'Respect existence or expect resistance' and another, 'better to squat than let homes rot' The protesters mounted the arch which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, and called for others to join them . It is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight, as a garbled message posted on Facebook by the group simply calls for 'Christmas lights... any and all radical/revolutionary messages' The gatehouse, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria, was sold in 2012 after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it from the government. The five protesters from anti fascist group 'Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians (ANAL)' called for support in a message on their Facebook page as police converged on the area. They posted: 'Urgent shoutout for banners, Christmas lights and anything else we can use to make the most of this massive canvas we have. Any and all radical/revolutionary messages welcome, but a preference for antifa (sic) in anticipation of the pegeda event on the 4th of this month. Much love.' One onlooker, who asked not to be named, said: 'I've seen a couple of guys on different parts of the roof throughout this morning. 'All they were doing was shouting power to the people. I have no idea how they got in there because I'm pretty sure it's offices.' A man was walking across the roof of the arch this afternoon wearing a black sleeveless hoodie with the hood pulled up and a black scarf across his face. They added five photographs of themselves up on the building. They are believed to be the same group who took over the former offices of the Institute of Directors on Pall Mall in central London last month. The building, not far from Buckingham Palace, was targeted because it was originally opened by Tony Blair, the groups said at the time. The squatters later bragged that it 'wasn't difficult' to get into the historic landmark which is a five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. The group said they got into the building overnight by climbing through an unlocked window. Proclaiming that what they were doing was 'more punk rock than the Sex Pistols,' one of the men, who only gave his name as 'Fox' said the group decided to take Admiralty Arch because it was a 'significant' building a stone's throw away from the Palace. 'Fox', who claimed to be one of the founders of the Autonomous Nation, said: ' We decided to take it because it is a significant building - you can see Buckingham Palace - there is a significant flow of traffic and we wanted to highlight the fact there are some corrupt individuals affecting this country and they need to get dragged out. Banners bearing housing messages were seen hanging from the Grade-I listed building as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side . 'Also, we wanted to highlight the fact that there are so many people that are homeless. 'We got in overnight through a window that was unlocked and just climbed in through that, there's about 15 of us here. 'The ironic thing is that we had been evicted from the building in Pall Mall and all we were doing was walking around here when a security guard said 'you can't come in here, you can't take this' - which said to us it must be empty and that's when we decided we could take it. 'We are trying our hardest to keep it clean and tidy, but when your squatting in central London the chaos does take its toll. 'We want to stay here as long as we can.' Fox admitted he was one of the hooded figures seen standing on the roof of the arch today and said he was shouting 'power to the people.' He also said that some of his colleagues were shouting 'ACAB' which stands for 'All Cops are B*****ds.' He added: 'That is not something I join in with [shouting about police] because I find a lot of police officers can be quite reasonable.' A 'Notice to Vacate' has been posted up the entrances to the landmark, however Fox warned that if the group are evicted 'There may be some individuals that do resistance. ' Another squatter, who asked not to be named, said: 'We decided to take it because it is two fingers up to the Royal Family. 'We are anarchists, we are not left wing or right wing, we are anarchists - look up the dictionary definition of the word. 'The Sex Pistols need to start doing a new album because what we are doing is more punk rock than the Sex Pistols.' Asked how long he wanted to squat in the landmark he replied 'indefinitely.' It is not the first time protesters have 'taken over' Admiralty Arch. In 2006, 14 Greenpeace protesters spent a day on the arch demonstrating over claims the government is using illegally logged wood. The gatehouse, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria, was sold in 2012 after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it from the government .

They added five photographs of themselves up on the building. It is not the first time protesters have 'taken over' the memorial . They unfurled banners accusing the government of 'trashing rainforests' during Cabinet Office renovations . A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said: 'At approximately 10.22 this morning we were made aware of five protesters on the roof of Admiralty Arch opposite Trafalgar Square. 'They remain on the roof. Officers are in attendance.' Facebook user Love Activists posted: 'Love activists, SHA and the Autonomous Nation Of Anarchist Libertarians have occupied the old cabinet office opposite trafalgar square, on the road which leads directly towards the palace. We call out for all hands to assist us.' Another user Natasha Quarmby added: 'The Guinness Trust AST tenants are in court today, trying to save their homes, they are on their own, and not getting the support that perhaps other Social Housing campaigns are getting, like the Aylesbury Estate or Sweets Way.... I urge you to visit to visit their page and show some support, they would really appreciate it. 'What about these guys too, No Russel Brand on hand here.... Show them some support x (sic)' Tenants face losing their homes for a new housing development on the Guinness Estate in Loughborough Park, Brixton, and have been staging protests. Housing trust the Guinness Partnership is planning to redevelop the estate and create 525 new homes on the site. Tenants on shorthold tenancy contracts have been told they have until April to find new housing. Many of the tenants have been living in the building for over 10 years and claim they will have to find somewhere to live outside London as they can no longer afford to pay Brixton rent prices. Admiralty Arch was commissioned by King Edward VII as a memorial to his mother, Queen Victoria, and was designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb. Completed in 1912, it spans the entrance to Trafalgar Square from The Mall and was traditionally used as the residence of the First Sea Lord and the heads of the Royal Navy. Admiralty Arch was commissioned by King Edward VII as a memorial to his mother, Queen Victoria, and was designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb. It is pictured during the Royal Wedding of Princess Elizabeth (Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip (Duke of Edinburgh) at Westminster Abbey in November 1947 . Neighbouring Admiralty House has provided grace-and-favour apartments for politicians including former defence secretary Liam Fox and former deputy prime minister John Prescott. The 147,300sq ft arch is spread across a basement, lower ground and ground floor, and five upper floors. The Government sold the long-term lease on the building in 2013. It is retaining the freehold, so will still have the final say after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it. Nights in the historic landmark, which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, won't come cheaply though; new owner Rafael Serrano is also the man behind the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, where rooms cost from £850 a night."}

Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer said on Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor on Monday night that Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban.' The former military intelligence officer said he had been told the information by  two senior sources who knew about a 2009 Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation into Bergdahl's activities. Scroll down for video . Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army Sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years was found to have be 'going over to the other side with a deliberate plan,' according to a former military intelligence officer . The investigation reportedly included a forensic review of Bergdahl's computer which showed his apparent intent to travel to Uzbekistan. 'He had made contact with local Afghans and wanted to be moved to Uzbekistan and then made contact with the Russians because he wanted to talk to Russian organized crime,' Shaffer told O'Reilly. 'Clearly he was not all there relating to what he was doing. I think we're going to see more and more, as this report is made public that there were a number of disconcerting things within Bergdahl.' Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer (pictured)  said on Fox News ' 'The O'Reilly Factor' on Monday night that Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban. Both are very severe' He said the NCIS investigaiton,  which included interviews with squad mates, indicated that Bergdahl made contact with an Afghan in an attempt to prepare for his departure. Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . Army officials announced Thursday that his Article 32 hearing will be held July 8 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas - he is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. That proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury. From there, it could be referred to a court-martial and go to trial. His attorney says Bergdahl was trying to find a U.S. general officer to report a disturbing situation when he left his combat outpost. Eugene Fidell, the attorney leading Bergdahl's defense, said in a letter released this week that the Army major general who investigated Bergdahl's capture in Afghanistan found he did not intend to remain away from his base permanently. Bergdahl disappeared in June, 2009 from a combat post in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban. He spent five years as a prisoner of war before he was freed last summer in a prisoner swap that angered members of congress members and some members of his unit. After an investigation of the circumstances of his capture, Bergdahl was charged this week with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, counts that could lead to life in prison. Documents released by his defense lawyers suggested the tack they may take in defending Bergdahl. The papers also included a statement from Bergdahl about his attempts to escape from his Taliban captors and his beatings while a prisoner. In a March 2 letter to Army General Mark Milley, who was responsible for deciding how to proceed with the case, Fidell said an investigation by an Army major general had concluded that Bergdahl did not plan to desert. 'While hedging its bets, the report basically concludes that Sergeant Bergdahl did not intend to remain away from the Army permanently, as classic 'long' desertion requires,' Fidell wrote. 'It also concludes that his specific intent was to bring what he thought were disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general office,' he added. Bowe Bergdahl, shown before his handover to US troops in May 2014 . Fidell declined to elaborate further on Friday. Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay. They were sent to Qatar and had to remain there for a year. Some U.S. lawmakers were angered by Bergdahl's release because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the Guantanamo prisoners, as required by law. Some fellow soldiers also said he had deserted. 'While many Americans have taken a broader and more sympathetic view, the depth and breadth of the current hostility to Sergeant Bergdahl are extraordinary and have enveloped the case with a lynch mob atmosphere,' Fidell said. 'Taliban five': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . He faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy. A former platoon-mate of Bergdahl told Daily Mail Online that Bergdahl is trying to win a public-relations battle with new claims about his defense strategy. CNN reported based on a Pentagon leak, that Bergdahl told Army investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report 'a breakdown in discipline and order' to military higher-ups – not with desertion in mind. 'This is clearly just a stunt to build sympathy before they go to trial,' said retired Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, who spoke for the first time since the Army announced Bergdahl would be court-martialed. 'No logical person would ever take the actions he undertook for the reasons he is now saying,' Vaughn told Daily Mail Online. He said the claim broadcast by CNN is 'ridiculous,' and that the Army's decision to charge Bergdahl with desertion is 'in direct conflict' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle-blower. CNN reported that a Defense Department official said Bergdahl had 'concerns about leadership issues at his base. 'He needs to be held responsible for what he did, for abandoning his post, for abandoning his platoon, for putting thousands of American soldiers, Marines and the whole United States military, thousands of members, in more danger, putting us into spots we wouldn't already have been in, had he not walked away,' he said. President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on . Vaughn also noted that his decision 'cost the US multiple soldiers' lives, five Taliban POWs, and the incredible monetary expense of searching for him.' However, both Cornelison and Buetow, who have left the US Army, stopped short of demanding that Sgt Bergdahl face prison. 'I don't want to ruin his life,' said Buetow. 'He does need to be dishonorably discharged, have all his ranks taken away, and he does not need to receive any benefits or back pay.' He added that he was proud the military had reached its decision despite the fact it would heap further pressure on the Obama administration for negotiating with the Taliban over a man accused of deserting. 'You can't get around the fact this makes some people look bad,' he said. But they had little sympathy for Sgt Bergdahl's account of being beaten and tortured during his time in Taliban captivity. 'He wouldn't have been put in that position, he wouldn't have been tortured, he wouldn't have been put through all that hardship if he'd never walked away,' said Cornelison. The punishments suggested by the veterans are within the range open to the court. It can reduce him to E-1, forfeit his pay and give him a dishonorable discharge."}

In a pink-walled bedroom, decorated with posters of Justin Bieber, best friends Zoe and Eleanor settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer. But they’re not about to video-chat with friends or a relative abroad. What they’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere. Scroll down for video . In a world where girls grow up fast, should these online hot or not videos really surprise us? Half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, with a fifth of girls under 11 confessing to have even tried diets (picture posed by model) ‘This is mine and Eleanor’s hot-or-not video,’ announces Zoe, waving a list of her classmates’ names at the camera. Then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘hot’ or ‘not’. It’s hard to think of a more spiteful game. ‘If we say you are not pretty or good looking, don’t get offended,’ pipes up Eleanor, issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind. ‘It’s just our opinion!’ The roll-call then begins. ‘Anna Wright’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register. ‘Hot!’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison. Next is Charlotte Davies. ‘Hot!’ is the decree. The name of a third classmate, however, is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks. ‘Not hot. Sorry!’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they’re saying. Remember, these girls, and the objects of their derision, are no more than ten or 11. And they’re far from alone. I’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children’s bedrooms across the country. Seven more classmates, both boys and girls, get the thumbs-down. As soon as the last judgment is handed down, the girls sign off with a satisfied: ‘Thanks for watching!’ They then upload the video to YouTube for everyone to see. In just a few days, the clip gets 120 views, suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it. But what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed, the tears shed into pillows, and the bravery needed to go to school the next day. Of course, cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘No, you can’t play with us’ were first uttered. But this is a new, more public humiliation. Scroll through YouTube and you’ll find ‘hot-or-not’ videos by girls who look no older than nine. Thousands more can be found on Facebook pages. These all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even Katie Hopkins would baulk at. There are variations — one angelic-looking little girl called Brianna used ‘Perfect’ or ‘Not Perfect’. She’s had 2,000 views so far. As a parenting expert who’s written five books on raising children, I know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘not hot’. And coming at such a critical time in their lives, when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are, those effects can be life-long. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. My worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves, telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down (picture posed by models) And if they feel they do not belong, they often start to avoid school. Meanwhile, those who feel ugly or not good enough rarely join in class discussions, for fear of drawing attention to their appearance. Indeed, more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education, according to a survey by charity Ditch The Label. Even worse, almost one in three bullied children goes on to self-harm, with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves. Who knows what nightmares this new type of bullying will cause? Living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15-year-old Alannya Blackmore as she prepares to take her GSCEs this summer. Alannya, who lives near Yeovil, Somerset, has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school, an oversubscribed academy rated ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted. Although she has been mainly rated ‘hot’, she has also been dismissed as ‘not’ in some clips. When she describes her experiences, it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘in’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others. As girls grow up, the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll, and it is this group, says Alannya, who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade. She says: ‘If you are judged to be “not”, you don’t say anything as you don’t want the others to think you are upset. But it’s humiliating because it’s so public. Some people will try to change the way they look because of it. There are loads of these videos. There are so many of them on people’s Facebook pages as well as YouTube — and there’s nothing adults can do.’ ‘Hot or not’ started off as an American phenomenon, where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users. In the UK, it morphed into the version we have today. Some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘liking’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one. Sadly, it’s often the most insecure youngsters, aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos, who volunteer. They’re seeking validation they won’t get. So why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger? One reason is puberty is kicking in earlier, with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development (with the associated surges in hormones) aged just eight. Girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon, so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions. In a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘hot-or-not’ videos should hardly surprise us. And middle-class girls are most likely to post these videos, as their families more often own iPads and computers. Middle-class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict, says Rachel Simmons, author of best-selling book Odd Girl Out. That also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments. What is so shocking is their total disregard for others’ feelings. But in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends, one result is that they’re not learning social skills or empathy. Indeed, they may be genuinely unaware of the impact. Throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular TV shows — The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, The Apprentice — and it’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends. ‘You are showing children that it’s entertaining to you — that normalises it,’ says Rosalind Wiseman, author of self-help book Queen Bees And Wannabes. But there may be a glimmer of hope. In a clip in another bedroom, Sophie, yet another girl in her early teens, signs off her YouTube video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying: ‘If it offends anyone, I am not sorry. I don’t care because I am just telling the truth.’ The comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently. ‘Everyone is beautiful in their own way. What is the point of doing these videos?’ asks one. ‘I can only hope that one day, you’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do,’ adds another. Let’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged. Some names have been changed.

The team used Purdue's PRIME Lab's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector, called a gas-filled magnet detector, to measure the radioisotopes. 'We succeeded in our measurement, but we were surprised the dates were so old,' said Darryl Granger, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue. The team used Purdue's PRIME Lab's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector, called a gas-filled magnet detector, to measure the radioisotopes. 'We succeeded in our measurement, but we were surprised the dates were so old,' Granger said. 'We double-and triple-checked our results, running the measurement again and again.' The gas-filled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotopes and throws the magnesium-26 on a different path with a curvature that misses the detector. This lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum-26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector, which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement. some of the other material found at the site: Stone tools found at a different level of the Sterkfontein cave also were dated at 2.18 million years old, making them among the oldest known stone tools in South Africa. The gas-filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the Genesis spacecraft. Unfortunately, the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to Earth. The crash delayed analysis of the Genesis samples, but Caffee continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014. Caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects, including those from the Sterkfontein site. 'Only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world,' Caffee said.

This lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum-26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector, which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement. Ron Clarke, a professor in the Evolutionary Studies Institute at Wits University in South Africa holds the Little Foot skull, among the oldest hominid skeletons ever dated at 3.67 million years old, according to an advanced dating method.  The date places Little Foot as an older relative of Lucy, a famous Australopithecus skeleton dated at 3.2 million years old that was found in Ethiopia. The gas-filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the Genesis spacecraft. Unfortunately, the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to Earth. The crash delayed analysis of the Genesis samples, but Caffee continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014. The new findings suggest Little Foot roamed the Earth at around the same time as the famed 3.2-million-year-old Lucy, an Australopithecus afarensis - shown in a reconstruction above. When discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia, Lucy was the only skeleton of the species known; she would've stood 3.5 feet (about a meter) tall. Currently, more than 300 individuals of this species, which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago, have been uncovered . Caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects, including those from the Sterkfontein site. 'Only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world,' Caffee said. 'One of the reasons I came to Purdue was to be a part of the revolutionary science that can be done when such resources are applied to challenging problems. These results highlight what can be accomplished through a collaboration that spans multiple disciplines. It couldn't have happened without the unique skills and resources each person brought to the table.' INRAP's French researcher Laurent Bruxelles shows Little Foot, a fossil with both ape-like and human features found in a cave at the Sterkfontein site, near Johannesburg. The 'Cradle of Life' is one of eight World Heritage Sites in South Africa . In 2008 the 47,000 hectare site site yielded the . discovery of Australopithecus sediba - thought to be an early human . ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics . The world-renowned Sterkfontein Caves is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world. It is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as 'Mrs Ples', and the almost complete hominid skeleton called 'Little Foot'. Granger's original attempt was the first time aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 radioisotopic dating had been used to determine the age of a fossil. He developed the method in 1997 and first used it to study changes in mountains, rivers and other geological formations. Because of their very slow rate of decay, these particular radioisotopes allow dating to reach back millions of years, much further in history than the more commonly known carbon-14 dating that can only stretch back about 50,000 years, he said. Only a small amount of the radioisotopes remain in the quartz after millions of years, and it can only be measured by the ultrasensitive analysis of accelerator mass spectrometry. 'We had given up and nearly walked away from the project thinking we had failed,' Granger said. 'Then the new detector was completed, and we thought we would give it one last try.'

Japanese engineers, who are trying to replace celebrities with human-like androids, have pushed the clone of transvestite entertainer Matsuko Deluxe into the limelight. The late-night television personality shared the stage with his 'Matsukoroid' doppelganger for the first time on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: The real Matsuko Deluxe (left) comes face-to-face with his android doppelganger Matsukoriod (right) 'Unnervingly real': Transvestite TV star Matsuko Deluxe (left) shared the stage with his 'Matsukoroid' doppelganger (right) on Saturday . Fake: Mr Matsuko's robotic clone make is debut at the weekend and has been described as 'unnervingly real' 'It’s unnervingly real,' said one commentator of the programme Matsuko Matsuko, which premiered at the weekend. Mr Deluxe, who is popular in Japan for his frankness, said it was 'fascinating' come face-to-face with his lookalike. 'I see myself as other people see me for the first time, and it was a significant moment,' he added. Working with world-famous roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro, Japan’s top advertising agency, Dentsu dreamed up the idea to clone an exact android copy of the rotund entertainer. A spokesman for the agency said: 'Artists and entertainers themselves aren’t yet seen as content that can be combined with technology, but the Dentsu group believes the need to develop android entertainers will grow.' Performing with natural movements, while voiced and controlled remotely by a voice impersonator, the robot was put through its paces in front of an incredulous audience for the first time on Nippon TV. For now, the  Matsukoroid robot is controlled by an human operator. But with 600 stock 'Deluxe' phases it can use in reply to voice and face recognition, it's hoped the Matsukoroid will be free of its operator by the end of the series as it learns on the job. Ishiguro’s science lab used the latest  silicon skin and state-of-the-art electronic actuators to achieve a lifelike look. Creating the android: Matsukoroid robot was developed at a cost of around £55,931 by the Japanese labs . Finishing touches: Japan’s top make-up artist was brought in to apply the finishing touches to  Matsukoroid . Japan’s top make-up artist was brought in to finish the job of making the bot glamorous. Observers said the effect was realistic enough to go beyond the creepy. Mr Ishiguro said: 'Because of advances in robotics, difficulty in telling man and machine apart could soon become reality.' Pepper is the first humanoid robot designed to live with humans . Looking slightly put out by his new, unpaid rival, the star - one of Japan's most overworked entertainers - said he was looking forward to 'using the robot to take a few well deserved days off'. Despite the jokes, the android could be part of trend that has a more sober side. According to research company Gartner, one in three jobs will be replaced by some kind of software, robot or smart machine by 2025. Matsukoroid was developed at a cost of around £55,931 by the Japanese labs that already produced an autonomous experimental news-reader. The theory goes that as robots start to look more human, people will become more sympathetic towards them. But with many Japanese already predisposed to being sympathetic to robots, because of the friendly way they are portrayed in Japanese popular culture, Mr Deluxe said he noticed his fans were more inclined to approach his clone rather than himself. During the recording of Matsuko Matsuko, one young fan even declared his love for Mr Deluxe through the robot and planted a kiss on the bot's thin, lipsticked-mouth during Saturday’s programme. Yuya Furukawa, the creative genius behind a raft of entertainment robots including the remarkable Pepper, wants to spearhead a robotics revolution for the consumer, where entertainment robots are just the start. Mr Deluxe, who is popular in Japan for his frankness, said: 'I see myself as other people see me for the first time, and it was a significant moment' Ishiguro’s science lab used the latest silicon skin and state-of-the-art electronic actuators to achieve a lifelike look . Collaboration: World-famous roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro (left), worked with Japan’s top advertising agency, Dentsu . The advertising company recently launched the Dentsu Robot Promotion Centre to tackle the new business which it says will be a 'new industrial revolution, second only to the internet'. Currently, the domestic robot market is worth about 900 billion yen (about £5billion) according to Japan’s trade ministry, which forecasts a 10-fold increase  by 2035. Dentsu also helped develop the first robot in space Kirobo – a 13-inch tall humanoid robot - which it plans to adapt as another personal entertainment drone. It was announced earlier this year that from this summer, the world’s first hotel staffed by robots will be opened in Japan. Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses, full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans, and clones of the dearly departed. There is even talk that the naturalistic, even engaging she-droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not-too-distant future. Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase last year and she is one of a series of geminoids, as their inventor dubs them, that are ripe for commercialisation says their creator - robotics professor Hiroshi Ishiguro. Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses and full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans . Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase last year. She relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life . Asuna is so convincing that many bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie. Unable, for now, to use some of the advanced artificial intelligence (AI), face and voice recognition systems that some Japanese robots coming on the market now use, Asuna relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life. This so-called tele-presence enables Asuna to come alive, taking on the operator’s personality. A fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years using all the above technologies to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans says Takeshi Mita, CEO of A-Lab in Tokyo, the company working with Prof. Ishiguro to make Asuna and her kind commercial. Previous attempts by Prof. Ishiguro's team had been dismissed as unconvincing and prone to what is known as the 'Uncanny Valley syndrome'. This is a term coined by another Japanese professor of robotics, Masahiro Mori. It describes the response of revulsion and creepiness when faced with something that looks almost, but somehow not quite, human. As robots become as dexterous as Asuna at mimicking humanity, so the theory goes, the syndrome will erase itself. 'Androids for the sex industry are a definite possibly' Already Asuna and other androids from A-lab have had a taste of the limelight, appearing on stage and voicing actors lines using tele-presence. A-lab also hopes to tap into another big business in Japan - the popularity of fantasy figurines that appeal to Japan’s legions of nerdy men or 'otaku'. As A-lab is working with highly respected Prof. Ishiguro, Mr Mita says the company has ruled out producing androids that might be used for sex. But a spokesman working with Ishiguro’s lab says it is not a great leap of imagination to think similar robots, given the advancement in robotics and silicone skin technology, will be used for sex. 'Physical relations will be possible in general with such androids,' said Takahashi Komiyama. 'Androids for the sex industry are a definite possibly. Some have even fallen in love with Ishiguro’s geminoids. So we can't rule those relationships out.'"}

It’s a rose-tinted, nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century British history. Every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story, with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator. So what is it about, this heartwarming tale of British derring-do? The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike . No. It centres on the 1984 miners’ strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they’re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep . What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: ‘Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.’ I’m sure Pride isn’t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies — Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners’ strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) —might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour. For the keystone of these Left-wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history, portraying Britain’s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists, fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable, and unfeeling bosses, bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords. There is no acknowledgment by the film-makers that the unions’ greed and bully-boy tactics all but destroyed the British economy, or that their beloved welfare state (which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country) relies on a strong, unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat. The film Pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the Left: bolshie unions and minorities (in this case, homosexuals). Naturally, it doesn’t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life-and-death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their Welsh colliery members. Scroll down for video . Wringing every drop of emotion from Left-wing audiences, the director ends the film with a scene showing bus-loads of miners turning up to support a gay pride march in London’s Hyde Park, as singer Billy Bragg’s There Is Power In A Union comes blasting over the soundtrack. Strangely absent from the story, of course, is any reference to the role the NUM played in bringing down successive British governments — both Conservative and Labour alike — and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped Britain in the Seventies and culminated in the Winter of Discontent. Nor is there any mention of the attempt by Arthur Scargill, the loony-Left leader of the NUM, to persuade communist Russia — not to mention Colonel Gaddafi — to bankroll the strike, which his members hadn’t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot. Billy Elliott is another film about ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories . The same historical revisionism is exhibited in Made In Dagenham, about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. As with Pride, the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of Left-wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause — in this case, male and female shop-floor workers. At no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive. The viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified. Made In Dagenham’s political message couldn’t be clearer, and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the Equal Pay Act by a Labour government in 1970. A more honest assessment of the British car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as Derek Robinson — ‘Red Robbo’ — at British Leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large. Indeed, a more realistic ending to Made In Dagenham would have pointed out that the Ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000, thanks, in part, to rising labour costs — pushed up by militant unions. Brassed off starring Pete Postlethwaite and Ewan McGregor portrayed Margaret Thatcher as an orge . Then again, that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of Britain’s industrial base. Perhaps the most glaring omission from such Left-wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of Margaret Thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the Seventies. The fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health, able to hold its head up high again in the world. But in so many Left-inspired British films of the past 25 years, whether Brassed Off (about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a Tory government), The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice Left-wing values with nasty Right-wing ones. Inevitably, the period before Thatcher is depicted as a golden age, a pastoral idyll straight out of a Hovis commercial, while the Britain she left behind is portrayed as a money-grubbing spiritual wasteland. Is it any wonder that such films make Ed Miliband, brought up by a Marxist academic father, ‘blub’? The only exception to this disgraceful series of truth-twisting films was The Iron Lady, in which Britain’s first female Prime Minister was shown in a more nuanced light, almost in spite of its makers’ Left-wing instincts. Made In Dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. It is broadly unsympathetic — there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia, which suggests an element of hostility — but actress Meryl Streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that Baroness Thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of Left-wing mythology. Not surprisingly, The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making. No doubt if it had depicted Thatcher as a cruel monster, the same critics would have acclaimed it an out-and-out masterpiece. But not to worry. This mistake was corrected the following year by Labour-supporting Danny Boyle. In his lavish £27 million opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics he made no direct reference to Britain’s greatest postwar Prime Minister — which was odd in itself — but left viewers in no doubt about his view of Thatcherism. Once again we were treated to the familiar Left-wing version of Britain’s history, in which top-hatted Tory industrialists, determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills, are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes, trade unionists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists. Boyle’s collaborator, Frank Cottrell Boyce, condemned Thatcher for being ‘insufficiently British’ and said ‘although she draped herself in the Union Flag, she never seemed to understand this country’. The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making . The truth is, it’s the Left that doesn’t understand contemporary Britain. We are not a drab, depressed country, riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality, as you would think from watching films such as Pride and Billy Elliot. On the contrary, crime is lower, life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past. The rights of women, gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both Left and Right, and our schools and hospitals have never been better (or more lavishly funded). Britain now has the fastest-growing economy in the Western world, with more jobs being created last year in Yorkshire — ironically, the county where so many of these Left-wing propaganda films have been set — than in the whole of France. Couldn’t we have just one home-grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern Britain and brings a tear of pride to us all, rather than Left-wing drivel that triggers ‘blubbing’ from Ed Miliband?"}

The 31-year-old woman who was arrested Thursday in New York for allegedly hatching a terrorist plot with her former roommate, 28-year-old Noelle Velentzas, was also friends with the one-time editor of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire. Samir Khan, an American citizen, was killed in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen. But before that he published several articles in Inspire, including a DIY bomb-making guide which the Boston bombers allegedly used to make their twin pressure-cooker explosives. Kahn was apparently so chummy with Siddiqui that he published one of her poems  in the precursor to Inspire, a publication called Jihad Recollections. Scroll down for full poem .

Extremist friends: Siddiqui befriended Samir Khan (left) in 2006, three years before he left the U.S. for Yemen and started Al Qaeda magazine Inspire (right). Khan published Siddiqui's poem in a publication which was the precursor for Inspire. Khan was killed in a 2011 drone strike . The poem, titled 'Take Me to the Lands Where the Eyes are Cooled' details Siddiqui's aspiration to  'drop bombs' and 'taste the Truth through fists and slit throats'. The informant says Siddiqui boasted about the poem in a August 2014 conversation, and said she had it published under the name 'Murdiyyah'. That same name was connected to a Facebook account associated with Siddiqui's computer IP address. According to the lengthy criminal complaint against Siddiqui and Velentzas,  Siddiqui met Khan sometime in 2006, while he was still living in the U.S. and they continued to communicate after he moved to Yemen in 2009. Siddiqui and Velentzas have been accused of plotting to carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City, and referred to themselves as 'real bad b****es' in conversations with a federal informant. The informant says the two were considering targeting a military base or police funeral with a homemade bomb - but that there was no specific terrorist plot at the time of their arrest Thursday. Siddiqui's friend Kahn was born to Pakistani parents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 25, 1989, but spent most of his life growing up in Queens - the same NYC borough where Siddiqui and Velentzas lived. Captured: Above, the home in Queens where Asia Siddiqui was arrested for allegedly plotting a bomb attack on the United States. She met fellow Queens native Samir Khan in 2006, and later had him publish one of her poems in an Al Qaeda magazine he was editing at the time from Yemen .

One of the articles he wrote for the magazine a a bomb-making how-to guide apparently used by Boston bombers Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) Other than refusing to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and blaming 9/11 on America, Khan appeared to be a well-adjusted young man when he attended  W Tresper Clarke High School. At the school, Khan wrote for the student newspaper, and participated in cheerleading and the glee club. However, at some point while still living in the U.S., Kahn started writing about Jihad from his parent's basement with a blog called 'InshallahShaheed,' or 'Martyr, God willing'. In 2004, his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where he attended Central Piedmont Community College. Five years later, Khan cut ties with his family and moved to Yemen. Khan was killed in a September 30, 2011 drone strike in Yemen - the same one that claimed the life of infamous American-born Islamic militant Anwar al-Awlaki. Take me to the lands where the eyes are cooled… . There are dreams I will leave everything behind for . Everything that has meaning in my life . Came to life with the introduction to my Lord . To the Oneness of my Lord . To the Mercies of His evermore . Than I can implore… . I have memories of soldiers of Allaah, memories of soldiers of shaytan . Memories of battlegrounds I haven't yet stepped on . Memories of battlefields I have never stepped on… . Yaa Allaah, take me – Aslamtu lirabbil aalameen . Take me… to the lands where the eyes are cooled . Jannatul Firdaus lies unpursued . I remind myself these sacrifies are only for You, too few . Hunger never felt so good as it does handcuffed . Some of us are born soldiers, battle runs through our blood . The sound of gun rattle sends a rush, soothing . I sleep with my eyes open, my subconscious constantly invoking . Al-Baa'ith! Al-Mu'eed! … my mind strays back to golden past I haven't yet lived… . All this Time I spent living Wahn dreams instead . Surrounded by walls of marble with widescreens, gardens of plush green . Pouring rain splashing on window panes, crystal ceilings . But Allaahi, nafsi only knew of empty feelings . Verily, time teases. The tease of martyrdom when the ruh leaves . In degrees; the degrees every soul dreams to seize . The degrees the angels appease one over another . The degrees of infinite seas with which the Lord pleads, the seven seas cannot encumber . I drown in ghibtah rage for a cavalry of my own . Plotting against shaytaan, suffocating for self-control . I want to be purified with every breath, every sweat, every echo, every harakah . The innumerable Tawaafs, the countless du'at, every step I take, I'm back at Arafat . I have work to do. Mistakes to correct, time to make up. No excuse to sit back and wait- for the skies rain martyrdom . Wait, No! The skies never rain martyrdom… . Martyrdom rains the skies! This world is a morgue on standstill watching the lost souls . In a cold, silent, blank stare – death stare . Death stirs in cold, silent, despair . Finding no place to call home, my vision blurs . All my fingers plucked out, my veins stretched to dull . Laughter poking into my sleep… into my dreams . Peeling laughter – the never-ending discourse of shaytaan's regime . Sahytaan Ar Rajeem… silenced. Prison walls that scream . The urges reincarnate into rebellion, into physical hunger, social incompetency . I am a slithering soul cringing to be free . The sweat of my efforts choke, wet strokes of vapour from a cloud . For my dreams to emerge… on cracked canvas – chipping off paint . The pigments of a lost nation. A curse. A nation. A religion. A pagan . An exiled. A misery. A child with incisors. A soliciting child . Soliciting for a while for golden signs… along the Cyprus, Nile, miles from . With a defied conscience eager for recompense… . The mountains are my castles, the sand is my sea . I peril through the wilderness as it's a part of me . I hear voices in the dark; feel pressure on my prayer rug . As I swing on a hammock between date palms, I drop bombs . I feel blisters beneath my feet as I sneak behind the enemy fleet . I fall sleep in the midst of battle before sirens and tanks owned by enemy ranks . Hit cloud nine with the smell of turpentine, nations wiped clean of filthy shrines . My teeth grind, my gums sting, my jaws flinch from and flame in chemical pain . And from all this. I confess I've become more sane . My backbones sprain from the tensions of unresolved game . I refuse to return home! Thrust open my wounds where my nerves have ruined . Rupture my skin where my membranes bare thinned . Tear my limbs that resist in abstinence . Here- taste the Truth through fists and slit throats – . And prefer this over death from slit wrists, pills, drunk and doped . Thank me later, for now, do what you will – let the noise persist! Running in half excitement, half regret, index finger to sky, a bulletproof vest . I turn around – what can my enemies do to me if Allah has promised me success? I waken with moistened eyes, tired and high off of unresolved life . Some dreams seem like real life; sometimes, life seems like a dream . I steel from the greedy the remnants of my fitrah and run into the dungeon of death . Jannah awaits! Source ."}

David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Scroll down for video . Mystery: This painting depicts Jesus Christ as single person but writer David Fitzgerald believes he was a literary invention that combined the stories from several cults and figures in Judea during the first century . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Historical researcher Michael Paulkovich has claimed that Jesus of Nazareth did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of Christ in historical texts by 126 writers during the ‘time of Jesus’ from the first to third centuries. He claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of Christianity to create a figure to worship. He says this is surprising despite his ‘global miracles and alleged worldwide fame.’ The 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of Jesus, when Paulkovich says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as Jesus - but none mention him. 'When I consider those 126 writers, all of whom should have heard of Jesus but did not - and Paul and Marcion and Athenagoras and Matthew with a tetralogy of opposing Christs, the silence from Qumram and Nazareth and Bethlehem, conflicting Bible stories, and so many other mysteries and omissions - I must conclude that Christ is a mythical character,’ he writes. ‘\"Jesus of Nazareth\" was nothing more than urban (or desert) legend, likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed.’ In a new book due to be published later this year, he will argue that the figure of Jesus was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald, whose first book 'Nailed: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed at All' was published in 2010, believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began Christianity. Instead he says early Christians drew upon the beliefs and rituals of other cults and faiths around in the first century. He argues that John the Baptist's cult is one such example and had initially been a competitor to the cult of Jesus before being incorporated into the Christian story. Mr Fitzgerald says there are inconsistencies in the Gospels of the Christian bible (pictured above) that suggest Jesus Christ was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life . The statue of Christ the Redeemer (above) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is one of many depictions of Jesus but Mr Fitzgerald says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance . Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' The earliest mention of Jesus yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' is inscribed. The box, which has been dated to 64AD - several decades after the crucifixion - was seized by the Israeli Antiquities Authority and its owner arrested for forgery in 2003. Although he was later cleared in 2012, doubts about the authenticity of the inscription remain. Others have said there could have been several people named James, whose father was called Joseph and had a brother called Jesus living in Jerusalem at the time. The James Ossuary (above) is thought by some to be the first mention of Jesus in an inscription on its side . There are three mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources which have been used to research the existence of a 'real' Jesus. A Jesus is mentioned in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which was written around 94 AD. Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect. This claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus' life, when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea. The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience. Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background. He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character. Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son. Roman historian Tacitus later mentions Christ and his execution with Pontius Pilate in his Annals, thought to be written around 116AD. Both mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution. Mr Fritzgerald also takes issue with many of the stories about the Crucifixion that stem from the first Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke. He said: 'There are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in Judea at the time they are set. 'Mark makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in Judea. 'If Jesus really had been arrested on the eve of Passover, they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend. 'The trial itself violates the rules of Jewish law - why was he not stoned? 'What we know about Pontius Pilate also suggests he was someone who would not do what the Jews asked him and would often do what they asked him not to. 'Instead Mark portrays him as being persuaded by the Jewish leaders to execute him.' Mr Fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of Christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account. He said: 'There is also no evidence for the tradition that sees Barabbas - an anti-Roman rebel and murderer - being released while Jesus, an innocent, is condemned to death. 'What this actually seems to be is Mark using the story as an allegory for the Yom Kippur scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for God.' Mr Fitzgerald hopes to have his new book 'Jesus: Mything in Action' out later this year. He added: 'It still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who Jesus is we get 50 different Jesus's emerging. There is no consensus.'"}

Thomas, 42, a referee for college football's Conference USA, has been considered before for a position in the NFL before she was chosen to start in the league next year, Baltimore reporter Aaron Wilson posted on his Twitter account. She has previously refereed preseasons games, scrimmages and minicamps after becoming part of the NFL's training program since 2013. Sarah Thomas, a 42-year-old mother of three from Brandon, Mississippi, has reportedly been tapped as the first woman to be hired as a full-time NFL referee. Above she officiates a preseason New Orleans Saints game . The Conference USA official became the first woman to officiate and FBS game in 2007 and the first to preside over a bowl game in 2009 . The NFL would not confirm Thomas's hiring on Friday, saying in a statement: 'The 2015 roster of officials has not yet been finalized. When it is, the new officials for 2015 and the entire roster will be announced.' Thomas will be among eight new hires made for the 2015 season, a source close to the matter told the LA Times. A Brandon, Mississippi, native, Thomas played basketball at University of Mobile before beginning officiating after attending a meeting with her brother. 'He told me there’s a bunch of old men sitting there. And that I might get some strange stares,' she told the Hattiesburg American last year. 'When I walked into that meeting sure enough that did happen.' She reffed basketball and high school football before moving on to college and becoming the first woman to officiate a FBS game in 2007 and the first to preside over a bowl game in 2009. 'The thing is, I've never set out to be the first and that hasn't changed, she said in 2013. 'I do this because I love it.' The mother of three credits her success in sports to being raised with brothers. The Mississippi native first began officiating after attending a meeting with her brother and credits her family with helping her succeed in the sports world . Though Thomas is tabbed to be the first full-time woman hire by the NFL, Shannon Eastin became the first female to officiate a game in the league when she was a replacement ref in 2012 . She also works as a  pharmaceutical sales representative, and says she doesn't wear the makeup she wears at her day job when she's on the gridiron,  according to Gulf Live. Shannon Eastin technically became the first woman to officiate an NFL game in 2012, when the league hired replacement refs while in negotiations with the officials' union. However, she stopped working for the NFL after owners reached an agreement with the regular officials. If Thomas begins reffing regular season games, the NFL would become the second major American sports league to have women officials, after the NBA. Violet Palmer and Dee Kanter were hired by the basketball league in 1997. Kantner was fired in 2002, though Palmer still regularly runs games in the playoffs. The NBA hired another female ref, Lauren Holtkamp, last year. Women umpires in baseball have only reached the Triple-A and preseason game levels. Female refs are common in the WNBA. Violet Palmer, NBA . Violet Palmer referees a game between the Orlando Magic and the Denver Nuggets in January of this year . Violet Palmer is the longest-serving female referee in any of American sport's four major leagues. She was first hired by the NBA in 1997 and has continued officiating men's basketball to the present day. Palmer later continued trailblazing, becoming the first woman to ref a playoff game in 2006, between the Indiana Pacers and the New Jersey Nets. Beyond breaking ground for her gender, she also publicly announced that she was lesbian in 2014, shortly after Jason Collins became the first NBA player to come out as gay. Dee Kantner, NBA . Dee Kanter, was hired the same year as Violet Palmer as an NBA ref but left after several seasons. Above, Kantner stands next to North Carolina Tar Heels coach Sylvia Hatchell at a 2013 womens's NCAA game . Dee Kantner joined the NBA officiating staff the same year as Palmer, but was fired after the 2001-2002 season. In a statement about her firing, the league said that she was 'not making sufficient progress in her own development'. Kantner said that she was 'stunned' by her letting go and that she had been given no warning about the decision. She worked as the supervisor of officials in the WNBA before going to the men's league, a role to which she has since returned. The long time referee has also consistently officiated women's college basketball. Lauren Holtkamp, NBA . Female NBA ref Laura Holtkamp, who  is completing her first season in the NBA this year, discusses a call with Denver Nuggets player Ty Lawson in November . Laura Holtkamp, 34, became the NBA's third female referee in 2014 after . She played basketball at Drury University in Missouri and had plans to get a master's degree in divinity at Emory in Atlanta before being drawn to refereeing. She soon became reffing women's college games as well as WNBA and NBA D-League matches, according to Grantland. Her first year in the league has not been without controversy. Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul was criticized by many for alleged sexism when he said 'this might not be for her,' after he was given a technical fowl by Holtkamp. Pamela Postema, MLB Spring Training . Female MLB umpire Pamela Postema calls balls and strikes behind the plate at a a Kansas City Royals game in 1992 . Pamela Postema was not the first woman to umpire a professional baseball game, with her first innings come five years after Bernice Gera sued Major League Baseball to preside over a minor league contest in 1972. However, Postema became a fixture in the professional games everywhere but 'The Show' in the 1980s. She spent seven years in Triple-A, the league directly below the majors, and even made it to spring training games in 1988 and 1989. However, she was controversially fired in 1989 after the death of MLB commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who had been considered supportive of her career. Postema filed a sex discrimination lawsuit after the firing ended her well-regarded career, which was settled out of court. Ria Cortesio, Minor League Baseball . Ria Cortesio, pictured at a Double-A game between the Jacksonville Suns and the Montgomery Biscuits in 2007, was fired the same year . Ria Cortesio was the face of female umpiring in baseball for many years in the mid-2000s. She spent nine years in the minor leagues, with the highest being the Double-A Southern League, according to the Houston Chronicle. Cortesio was also the first woman since Postema to umpire an exhibition game when she worked a spring training match-up between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks. She also worked the Home Run Derby at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh. Her umpire rating in Double-A slipped during the 2007 season and she was let go in the autumn of that year, according to ESPN. Shannon Eastin . Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate a regular season NFL game in 2012. Above, she follows the Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts during the same month . Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate a regular season NFL game in 2012 when she was used as a replacement ref in the September 2012 game between the St Louis Rams and the Detroit Lions. Regular officials were locked out by owners during a 2012 dispute, a replacement refs were used until an agreement was reached at the end of September. She had previously officiated the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference college games and high school games before being hired by the NFL. The Massachusetts native, 42 at the time, has not returned to the NFL since the end of the referee lockout."}

Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was ‘more of a different child,’ as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: ‘I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things. I was always questioning everything to see how it worked.’ In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth – he had hundreds of patients, saw as many as 30 daily with some paying as much as $7,000 a pop and had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store. Three years before he graduated and before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly. Loss: Three years before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes.

Dr. Brandt was known for his ‘infectious grin’ and characterized by classmates as having a sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.' He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student . The awards and accolades followed him from this 1967 yearbook through his professional career . Speaking to the New York Times last March he admitted: ‘It was a lot to process, but you just have to forge ahead.’ He certainly did. Immediately after high school he attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University’s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters. As a student he loved oncology, nephrology, hematology and cardiology. The one area of medicine in which the life-long bachelor took no real pleasure was pediatrics. He explained: ‘You spent all your time calming patients down.’ Between 1976 and 1978 he completed his internship at New York University Veterans Administration before going onto specialise in dermatology at the University of Miami, 1978–1981. He set up a private practice in Miami and it was only in 1998 that an invitation to use a colleague’s New York office once a month to treat patients with ever evolving newly introduced facial fillers led Dr Brandt to his ultimate area of expertise.

Hurtful parody: According to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Tina Fey takes a selfie with Maya Rudolph and  Martin Short last February. Poignantly, given his own unhappy demise, Dr Brandt’s ambition in his work had always been, he said, ‘to restore a face to harmony,’ and ‘to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves.’ He built an empire on his work. As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ as Dr Franff. The good life: In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth. He had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store . Played by Martin Short Franff’s transformation is so grotesque that he can barely utter certain words – including his own name. He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being ‘a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,’ the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep. There have been many tributes since his death Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, yesterday tweeted, ‘Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.’ Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: ‘My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr Frederic Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer.’"}

The Los Angeles neighbourhood is home to many of Tinseltown’s most powerful players, but Getty’s surname was all that was needed to ensure his entry into that social set. The 47-year-old grandson of John Paul Getty, once the world’s richest man, Andrew was an heir to the vast Getty oil fortune. Lurid early reports of his death and troubled past suggest a new chapter has opened in the tragic history of a family that epitomises, like no other, the saying that money doesn’t bring you happiness. Scroll down for video . Found dead: Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of John Paul Getty once the world’s richest man, was an heir to the vast Getty oil fortune . John Paul Getty, a misanthrope so tight-fisted he put a payphone in the hall of his Surrey mansion, failed disastrously in his quest to prevent his huge fortune spoiling his heirs. A string of Gettys have died from drug overdoses, while another grandson of the family patriarch, Jean Paul Getty III, never recovered after he became the victim of a notorious and brutal kidnapping. Other members of the supremely dysfunctional family became embroiled in decades long lawsuits and divorces, always over money. Even Andrew’s father, Gordon, a supposedly squeaky-clean married philanthropist and classical composer, was mired in scandal when it emerged he had a secret second family. In this latest tragedy, police say a woman called them to Andrew Getty’s home on Tuesday, saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack. Investigators say he had been having severe stomach problems and suffered significant bleeding in his rectal area. However, they believe he died of natural causes or an accident. Andrew Getty’s former girlfriend, identified in the U.S. media as aspiring actress Lanessa De Jonge, 32, raised the alarm. Reportedly she had told him to see a doctor about ‘painful bowel movements’. Andrew Getty’s former girlfriend, identified in the U.S. media as aspiring actress Lanessa De Jonge, 32, raised the alarm . Though investigators do not regard her as a suspect, she allegedly has a history of psychiatric problems and has been arrested a number of times for harassment and disorderly conduct. Reports in America suggest that according to police insiders, officers had previously been called to the house 31 times, usually over domestic disturbances. Lanessa and Andrew were frequently under the influence of drugs when officers visited. Then two weeks ago, Getty took out a restraining order against her, the Los Angeles police said yesterday. At the same time as he took out the order, he said he had a serious medical condition and that doctors had warned him that ‘heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously’, putting him at ‘serious risk’. Twelve years ago, when Getty was being sued over a disagreement with a former employee, he was portrayed in court by ex-colleagues on a film he directed as a threatening, cocaine-snorting gun nut. Educated at the private Dunn School in California, he later studied at New York University and the University of Southern California. Intriguingly, records show he has been prosecuted 12 times for unpaid taxes. In this latest tragedy, police say a woman called them to Andrew Getty’s home on Tuesday, saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack . The body of Andrew Getty, naked from the waist down, was discovered in a bathroom at his gated, three-storey £2.6 million villa in the Hollywood Hills on Tuesday afternoon . Andrew was the second eldest of four sons of Gordon Getty by his publisher wife, Ann. Gordon was the fourth son of the family patriarch J. Paul Getty, yet still Gordon assumed control of the $4billion family trust when his father died in 1976. J. Paul Getty married five times and produced six children, whom he treated with such disdain he never even bothered to attend their weddings. He became the world’s richest man when he struck oil in the Middle East in 1953. He reportedly showed affection for his youngest son, Timmy. But when he died aged 12 from a brain tumour, his father didn’t go to his funeral. Timmy’s mother claimed the tycoon had even complained about paying for his son’s medical treatment. His other sons fared little better. His eldest son and heir apparent, George, worked himself into an early grave trying to impress his father in the family business. He became so despairing at his failure that he would stab himself in the arms with a letter opener. He turned to drink and drugs, and died in 1973 after overdosing on pills. J. Paul Getty’s second son, Ronald, was virtually disinherited after his mother Adolphine — Getty’s third wife — dared to drag her feet over a divorce when the tycoon decided to move on to wife number four.

John Paul Junior, the third boy, has gone down in history as the prodigal son. After a first job earning $100 a month as a petrol pump attendant, he joined the family business, but took to drinking heavily. He became a heroin addict soon after meeting his beautiful second wife, the Dutch actress and socialite Talitha Pol. They became darlings of the celebrity hippie set, partying with Mick Jagger and spending most of the Sixties in a druggie haze. When Talitha died of a heroin overdose in 1971, a devastated John Paul Junior holed himself up in his home in England. Unsurprisingly, he was cut off financially by his father, who intoned: ‘No Getty can be a drug addict.’ The shortage of funds proved tragic in 1973 when John Paul Junior’s oldest child, John Paul III, 16, was kidnapped in Rome by the Mafia. When a $17million ransom demand arrived, his skinflint grandfather refused to help. It was only after one of the boy’s ears was sent through the post that Getty coughed up and the hostage was released. Traumatised by his ordeal, the young John Paul Getty III slipped into cocaine and heroin addiction, washed down with a bottle of bourbon a day. John Paul Getty, a misanthrope so tight-fisted he put a payphone in the hall of his Surrey mansion, failed disastrously in his quest to prevent his huge fortune spoiling his heirs . In 1981, he suffered catastrophic liver failure and a severe stroke, emerging from six weeks in a coma virtually blind and paralysed from the neck down. He could communicate by little more than a high-pitched scream. He died aged 54 in 2011. Until now, Andrew Getty’s side of the family lived largely in comparative obscurity. After inheriting the family business empire, his father Gordon sold Getty Oil to Texaco for $10 billion in the mid-Eighties. He then settled in San Francisco to devote his life to philanthropy and his real passion: writing classical music. However, in 1999, he, too, plunged the Getty name into controversy after three previously secret children — then aged eight, ten and 14 — went to court to change their name to Getty. They and their mother, Cynthia Beck, it emerged, had been Gordon’s secret second family in Los Angeles, and the girls had decided to claim their birthright. His wife, Ann, had been aware for two years about the other family. Gordon and Ann’s second son, Andrew, meanwhile, had been trying with little success to become a film director. In 2003, Andrew was sued by a studio assistant, Ingrid Jacobs, for £500 in unpaid wages for his first and only film, a horror movie made in the house where he died this week. The court heard how Getty snorted cocaine, spent heavily on prostitutes and carried a gun — keeping an arsenal of assault rifles at his home and threatening the film crew with them. ‘All of us lived in fear of his dark, violent moods,’ said Ms Jacobs in court. ‘He once screamed at me: “I’m going to kick you in the kidneys so hard that you choke.” ‘He had no worries about spending thousands a week on high-price prostitutes, but he was mean as hell with everyone else.’ Charity Thomson, the movie’s assistant director, said she saw Getty snorting drugs while on the set. She described him as ‘a spoilt rich kid who doesn’t value his own life or that of anyone else’. Money never bought the family patriach J. Paul Getty love, a fact he belatedly acknowledged when he said he would have given half his kingdom for a happy marriage. Now, with another troubled Getty life cut short, his family would no doubt agree the money that brought them such luxury has also brought seemingly endless misery. As one commentator said: ‘They were born with golden ladles in their mouths, and they choked on them.’"}

Ed Miliband was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed that the Coalition had made it harder to get a GP appointment. Mr Miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election – which he said was directly contributing to the A&E crisis. Scroll down for video . Labour launched a poster declaring 'the Tories have made it harder to see a GP' but critics were quick to point out that the figures were out of date . His comments came after Labour launched a poster declaring 'the Tories have made it harder to see a GP'. But critics were quick to point out that his figures were out of date – and that the GP crisis is widely blamed on Labour's GP contracts, which allowed them to opt out of out-of-hours care. Meanwhile it emerged last night that a Labour-supporting GP had circulated a letter claiming that 'five years of flat-line funding' have 'crippled the NHS'. A version of the letter – organised by Dr Clare Gerada, the former chairman of the Royal College of GPs – appeared in the Guardian signed by more than 100 doctors last night. It claimed the 'direction of travel' under the Tories was towards privatisation, adding: 'Another five years of Tory austerity will sap staff morale and reduce the NHS to a poor service for poor people'. Labour were accused of orchestrating the letter as a 'stitch up'. Conservative MP Julian Smith said: 'This Labour stitch up is another desperate attempt to weaponise the NHS. 'Under this government, we've got more doctors, more nurses and more patients being seen than ever before.' In an email obtained by the Tories, Dr Gerada said signatures were being collected to 'counter' the 100 business leaders who wrote a Tory-supporting letter to a national paper last week. Mr Miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election – which he said was directly contributing to the A&E crisis . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised to give NHS chiefs 'whatever they need' after the election. Mr Hunt yesterday claimed a Conservative government would find whatever money the health service said was required to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries. The apparently open-ended commitment will raise eyebrows at a time when public spending is under increasing pressure. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has said the health service needs an extra £8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are. The Tories have pledged to find huge public spending cuts, and every pound spent on the NHS means less for other priorities such as education and defence. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We will back the NHS's own plan in full ... We will give whatever they need, it might be more than £8billion, it might be less.' Dr Gerada said she was a member of the Labour party but not an 'activist' and said the letter had been organised independently. She told the Telegraph: 'It has not been orchestrated by Labour, it has been put together by me and a few other medical leaders.' The Tories say that at least two of the signatories are Labour supporters, including one who tried to stand as a Labour candidate and another who has previously spoken at the Labour Party conference. The signatories, including Professor John Ashton, retired director of public health, and Simon Capewell, professor of public health in Liverpool, wrote that the NHS 'is withering away'. They said 'if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had under the NHS and have to pay more for health services.' Meanwhile, as figures yesterday revealed that A&E waiting times are the longest since records began in 2004/05, Mr Miliband said: 'One of the reasons for that is it's got a lot harder to see a GP. 'Across England there are some 600 fewer GP surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends than there were at the last general election.' But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Labour's 'shoddy figures are not only wrong but also expose Labour's rank hypocrisy over GP access'. Mr Hunt said the figures quoted only go up to 2013/14 and that since then, the Conservatives' extended hours scheme, announced last year, has covered 1,100 practices and helped 7.5million patients see GPs in the evenings and at weekends. He said by next year the scheme will cover 1,400 additional practices, serving 10 million more people. He added: 'The next Conservative Government will deliver a truly seven-day NHS, putting right a problem which began with Labour's disastrous 2004 GP contract.' Mr Hunt said the contract had allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for their patients out of hours. He added that far from cutting funding, the Tories would give the NHS 'whatever it needs' if the party wins the election. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of 'making cheap political points using outdated statistics'. 'It's pretty rich coming from a party that blew £12billion on an NHS super computer,' he said. Mr Clegg also described shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as 'a slightly sort of cardboard cut out, a rather sort of silly Labour politician.' Medical leaders also criticised Labour's claims yesterday. GP Mike Dixon, chairman of the NHS Alliance, said: 'Labour's poster is not fair. 'Patient access to extended hour services hasn't got worse, as these figures ignore the Prime Minister's new scheme.' Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said the figures were the latest available. Following the letter from 100 doctors claiming the NHS is not safe in Tory hands, Labour is today expected to launch a fresh attack over the health service. JAMES SLACK sifts the claims from the reality. CLAIM: There are 590 fewer GP surgeries open at evenings and weekends compared to Labour's last year in office . REALITY: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is using figures which compare July 2009 to the year ending April 2014 - which means they are a full year out of date. This year is crucial in comparing the record of the last two governments. In April 2014, David Cameron launched his £50million Challenge Fund to pay for GPs to open out-ofhours. It guaranteed at least one GP surgery locally would be available in the evening and weekends. The Tories say it has led to improved access for 7.5million people at 1,100 surgeries. By March next year, a further £100million will have been spent on a further 1,417 practices across the country. Overall, there are now 1,600 more GPs than in 2010. It is not the first time Labour has used old figures in what is already a dishonest election campaign. The party's claim that families are £1,600 worse off under the Tories was also 12 months past its sell-by date. CLAIM: The Tories have made it harder to see a GP . REALITY: Anybody with memory of the Blair Years will know it is Labour - and the disastrous 2004 decision to renegotiate the existing GP contract - which lies at the root of the current problems. Not only did Labour abolish the requirement for every patient to have a named GP who was responsible for them, instead attaching them only to a surgery, but, most crucially, GPs were given more money despite no longer being required to work at weekends or at night. The inevitable result? Nine out often GPs stopped providing out-ofhours care - hugely increasing the pressure on hospital A&E departments. Former health Minister Mike O'Brien said the deal Labour gave to the GPs was 'the best they ever had... they probably all voted Labour in 2005'. Tory health secretary Jeremy Hunt has since made modest changes to the contract, such as giving four million over-75s a named GP, but there is still no requirement to work out- of-hours. CLAIM: The Tories have left the NHS weaker than at any stage in its history . REALITY: In the latest attempt by Labour and the Left to 'weaponise' the NHS, 100 doctors last night released a letter which claimed the NHS was 'withering away' under the Coalition and 'if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had'. It went on: Privatisation not only threatens coordinated services but also jeopardises training of our future health care providers and medical research, particularly that of public health.' The problem is that much of the letter is at odds with the facts. Along with foreign aid, spending on the health service was ring-fenced from the cuts. Every year, it has received a real terms increase of at least 0.1 per cent. This equates to around £2.5billion extra a year. On privatisation, the NHS outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the Labour party - but less than 2 per cent under the Coalition. It was Labour - not the Tories - which presided over the shameful scandals at Basildon and Mid Staffs hospitals which cost hundreds of lives."}

I was at the SculptureCenter in the New York borough of Queens, a spot dedicated to all things modern and avant garde. Taking pride of place was a cluster of bottles, each of which contained dog fluff and a photo of the mutt it came from. ‘We’re running a competition to find new talent,’ explained the black-clad curator, brightly. ‘Maybe I’ll shave the cat next time I visit my parents,’ I thought to myself. ‘If I stick the fluff in a bottle, it might just win.’ Cultural revolution: New York is in the throes of a cultural revolution - but MOMA is still brilliant . Welcome, then, to Nu York, a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in Friends and Gossip Girl and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in Brooklyn and Queens - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme. Gone (mostly) are the rough tenements and in their place, a bustling network of shop-lined streets and some seriously classy bars and hotels. Among the latter was the Z Hotel, a stark block of a building decked out in the industrial-chic style so beloved of London hipsters. Stateside Shoreditch, as it were. It was all a far cry from Iceland where I had begun my trip, courtesy of an Icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of Reykjavik and the spectacular Golden Circle for up to seven days en route to Boston, Anchorage, Washington or, in my case, New York. Although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009, the Icelandic capital shows signs of recovery – not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the Apotek Hotel, a gloriously Scandinavian-looking place to stay, as I arrived at midnight following an evening flight from London. The next morning, I dragged myself out of bed for a Viking-style cooking class at Salt Eldhus where I learned to cook barley risotto and salt and pepper salmon – the perfect way, as it turned out, to fortify me for the dramatic scenery that came next. Stunning: The Gullfoss Waterfall in Pingvellir National Park is a short hop from Reykjavik . Awe-inspiring: Geysir is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air . Covered with a thick layer of snow, Pingvellir National Park sits atop the fault line that separates the American continent from the European one and provides Iceland with its volcanoes, geysers and geothermal springs. The site of Iceland’s first parliament, it’s a short hop from Geysir, where a series of geysers explode in a shower of boiling water and revolting sulphurous stench every five minutes or so. Slipping and sliding on the ice, the first explosion caught me unawares and forced me to jump back. At the next one, I held my nerve, looking smugly round at the tourists who had been caught on the hop like I had been. Then came a trip to Friðheimar, a series of greenhouses filled with tomato plants and set next to a stable crammed with hairy Icelandic ponies. The glowing buildings were an odd sight, although the produce was second to none, but even that paled in comparison to the Secret Spring – a bubbling pool flanked by a geyser and lit, on clear nights, by the shimmering green and purple glow of the Northern Lights. Sitting there, watching them ripple, was truly magical. The next morning, it was off to New York which, with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants, was a very different prospect indeed. While Iceland, like the rest of Scandinavia, boasts an effortless flair for design and a natural cool, the Big Apple has clearly worked on it. Beneath the too-cool-for-school surface, however, lies some old-fashioned Americana – not least in the all-American charm of the cheerful locals. Looking cool: Williamsburg, home to Jake Gyllenhaal among others, is awash with artisan bars . New look: Queens has had a makeover, with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars . Among them are the staff at the Roger Smith Hotel in Manhattan, who took a break from watching the Super Bowl to ply me with burgers and fries as I arrived, dishevelled, following a five-hour flight from Reykjavik. The next morning, after an all-American breakfast of bacon and waffles, I left the chintzy charms of the Roger Smith behind for a visit to MOMA, the epicentre of New York’s cultural cool. A fabulous place set in a glass and steel building over several floors, it is crammed with modern art dating from the mid-18th century onwards. Matisse, Monet and Picasso are there in numbers, as are Frieda Kahlo and Andy Warhol. Rothko, Malevich and Seurat dot its walls, as does some appalling stuff by the likes of Jean-Pierre Basquiat – avoid that and stick to the good bits on the third floor is my advice. Carrying bags of Warhol prints and a Sunday morning sized MOMA mug, we hopped into one of New York’s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low-rise Williamsburg, where another hipster favourite – craft beer – is taking hold. Beneath the pub where we ate lunch was a small collection of stills, where a variety of types, including one containing raw oysters, was being brewed. It was all delicious and a pleasant change from the Budweiser usually found in American bars. Artisan beer, artisan food and artisan art are all staples of New York’s burgeoning hipster culture, although to a cynical Brit like me, some of it felt a little try-hard. Brilliant: The Museum of Moving Image is set to become a New York must-visit - well worth going to . A case in point is the play Sleep No More, which made its début in London to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in New York. Set in a warehouse over several floors, the idea is that you walk in at an unspecified point in the play (I managed to work out that it was a version of Macbeth but not everyone does) and follow the actors around attempting to get a handle on the action. Beginning in a wonderfully old-fashioned red-velvet lined bar, the action was compered by a chap with a British accent taken from the Dick van Dyke school of acting, who showed us into a lift and provided us with Scream-style masks before throwing us into the thick of things. Moving around the huge set, I walked into scene after scene and never really got much sense of the plot, although I did find myself becoming increasingly irritated with the hammy miming. Indeed, so disjointed was Sleep No More,   $20 booklets explaining the plot were being flogged to theatregoers, who had already paid $80 to get in, on their way out. Being unable to work out what it was all about is clearly a recurrent problem. Luckily for those whose tastes don’t stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff, New York still has much to love. Along with MOMA, there’s the brilliant Museum of Moving Image in Queens which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the US’ lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces, among them the creepy doll which found fame in the Exorcist. Then there’s the bewildering selection of places to eat. In Queens alone, there’s everything from Brazilian to British and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious. And of course, there are all those iconic sights: the slow-moving Hudson River, the Rockerfeller Center, the Statue of Liberty and more. Nu York might not be to everyone’s taste but there’s no shortage of reasons to love the Big Apple – pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included. Just don't make me watch Sleep No More again. Icelandair (icelandair.co.uk) flies from five UK airports including Birmingham to 14 North American destinations.

The Reverend Lawrence Ford praised Mr Figueroa for his selfless work as an Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts, saying that his life had been 'cut too short,' according to the New York Daily News. One Boy Scout at the funeral told CBS the victim had shown 'devotion and leadership'. Meanwhile, Paul Culff of Asphalt Green, said Mr Figueroa had 'left an impression' with the facility's youngsters. Mr Figueroa's parents placed a white cloth over his brown casket as a symbol of his innocence. Inside the casket, their son was reportedly dressed in a blue shirt, a checkered tie and a navy vest. Following the service, a number of pallbearers - including Mr Figueroa's father and his brother Neal - were pictured carrying his casket to a hearse in front of  loved ones, who were holding red roses. It was then placed in a hearse and driven away. In addition to Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon's fatal injuries, 22 more people were wounded in the five-story building explosion at 121 Second Avenue.

Former model: Mr Figueroa (pictured left and right) was declared missing following the terrifying incident . Mr Figueroa's date, Teresa Galarce, 22, suffered a broken nose, a broken rib and a punctured lung. She is now recovering from her injuries. It is unknown whether she attended Tuesday's funeral. The explosion also caused fires at 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue. All buildings apart from 125 ultimately crumbled to the ground, prompting an enormous response from emergency crews. Following the recovery of his body, Mr Figueroa's family had started raising money to help cover his funeral costs and other expenses via a GoFundMe page, which amassed more than $27,000. On Monday, it was reported that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the building's landlord's son of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast on March 26. The unidentified plumber admitted that he illegally tapped a gas line before the explosion but said he only did so on the orders of the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr., the New York Post reported. Another victim: Last week, Mr Figueroa's body was tragically pulled from the building's rubble alongside that of 26-year-old busboy, Moises Locon (pictured), who had worked at the sushi restaurant six days a week . Aftermath: Firefighters continue to hose down the site of the fire that gutted three buildings on March 27 . The gas was apparently being siphoned from the restaurant to tenants in the building. Investigators suspect the illegal hookup was switched before Con Ed inspectors visited the building on March 26, and after they left, it was put back, the Post reported. It added that authorities have not yet decided whether to use the plumber's statement against him or if they will get him to testify in exchange for a deal. Neither the landlord, Maria Hrynenko, nor her 29-year-old son Michael, who also goes by the name 'Mischou', responded to the paper's requests for comment. On Monday, it was claimed that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr (pictured), of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast . Property records show he lives in Sparkhill in Rockland County, New York after moving from 7th Street in the East Village last year, where he lived in an apartment owned by his family. The investigation continues as authorities continue to pick through the rubble at the site. But charges including second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment could be brought against anyone believed to have been behind the blast, the Post reported. In August, utility workers found that the gas line had been illegally tapped, Con Ed said. The discovery led the company to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before the explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, according to Con Ed. But 15 minutes after the workers left, the smell of gas was reported. No one called 911 or Con Ed. Instead, Michael Hrynenko and a contractor, Dilber Kukic, opened the basement door to check on where the smell was coming from. When they did so, a massive explosion shot through the building, forcing rubble onto the street and sparking a fire that spread to neighboring buildings. Both Michael Hrynenko and the contractor escaped the scene, but officials later pulled the bodies of Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon, who worked at the restaurant six days a week, from the rubble. The contractor, Dilber Kukic - who is facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the explosion."}

The latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain – where their country of origin is known – were born overseas . When Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV it was guaranteed to provoke controversy. Instantly the Ukip leader was accused of ‘dangerous scaremongering’. But, while some of his claims were overstated, the latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain – where their country of origin is known – were born overseas. Mr Farage said on Thursday night’s televised debate: ‘Here’s a fact and I’m sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. ‘There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. It’s not a good place for any of them to be, I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. ‘You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 a year per patient. ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband branded the comments ‘disgusting’ and former England captain Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: ‘Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!’ Yesterday Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: ‘Farage’s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form.’ Mr Miliband also tweeted: ‘He should be ashamed. The fact he isn’t says so much.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) branded the comments ‘disgusting’ and former England captain Gary Lineker (right) wrote on Twitter: ‘Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!’ But last night Mr Farage stood by his claims, telling ITV news they were ‘cold, hard facts’. The figures on HIV and foreigners are notoriously hard to calculate because they could include British nationals who were born abroad. According to Public Health England, there were 6,000 diagnoses of HIV in the UK in 2013. Where the country of origin is known, 54 per cent of new diagnoses were foreign-born patients. However, the same body estimated that 76 per cent of all newly diagnosed HIV infections among gay or bisexual men and 57 per cent among heterosexual men and women in 2013 probably happened in the UK. The cost of antiretroviral drugs for HIV patients per year has been put between £10,000 and £16,000 by the National Aids Trust. Aids charity Avert has estimated that the cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is around £18,000 per year, although this varies depending on the type and number of drugs taken and the stage of HIV infection. Each HIV patient from overseas – even if here illegally, a failed asylum seeker or a student on a temporary visa – is entitled to free treatment on the health service. This ‘free to all’ policy was introduced in 2012 to try to stop the spread of the virus in the UK. Officials raised concerns about the risk of health tourism by HIV patients in a Department of Health report on their treatment, which was published in 2012 to explain the change in policy. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: ‘Farage’s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form’ It said: ‘Given the high cost of ARVs [antiretroviral drugs], for all overseas visitors we recommend that advance prescribing of ARVs is for a maximum of one month in the first instance. ‘Whilst it is unlikely that people with HIV, or at risk of HIV, will visit the UK solely for the purpose of receiving free HIV treatment, this guidance … makes clear the arrangements that will enable monitoring to ensure this is not the case.’ Mr Farage’s comments on HIV treatment were believed to be aimed at reviving Ukip’s core vote, as part of a strategy nicknamed ‘shock and awful’. He had originally intended to warn about the relatively high proportion of migrants with tuberculosis before realising that HIV drugs are more expensive, sources alleged. During the party leaders’ debate, Leanne Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night when she attacked Mr Farage’s comments on HIV treatment. The Conservatives would not go into coalition with Ukip after the election, Michael Gove said yesterday. A day after George Osborne refused to rule out a deal with Nigel Farage, the Tory chief whip told the BBC: ‘A coalition with Ukip? Nein, danke! Nein, danke is German for No, thank you.’ But Labour said the answer was still not definite enough for them. Andy Burnham has written to David Cameron asking for a cast-iron guarantee there would be no Tory-Ukip coalition. Mr Farage has said he is not interested in a formal coalition. But last night he described the Prime Minister as ‘somebody we can sit down and talk to’ in the event of a hung parliament. One Ukip condition would be an in/out EU referendum by the end of 2015. She said: ‘This kind of scaremongering is dangerous, it divides communities and it creates stigma to people who are ill, and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself.’ George Osborne, the Chancellor, asked about it afterwards, said that he would ‘not dignify that with an answer’ and Mr Miliband tweeted yesterday that the comment was ‘disgusting’. It comes after Ukip’s share of the vote in recent polls has eroded significantly from highs of 19 per cent late last year, to just 10 per cent in several polls over the past month. Mr Farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in Thanet South. Ukip’s first MP, Douglas Carswell, refused to specifically endorse Mr Farage’s remarks yesterday. The former Conservative, standing in Clacton, Essex, added: ‘It is sensible and reasonable to say we want a national health service, not an international health service, and that’s all I’m going to say.’ He insisted the party was not split and added: ‘I thought Nigel was superb in the debates. His answers were credible.’ A half-time poll from ComRes/ITV News showed 24 per cent of voters giving Mr Farage the lead in the debate, but almost as many (22 per cent) thought he was also the worst of the seven leaders. Mr Carswell’s father, Wilson, was a respected physician and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV in Uganda in the 1970s. He was the inspiration for the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan in the Oscar-winning movie The Last King of Scotland. Mr Farage appeared to embarrass Mr Carswell when he won his seat in a by-election in October by calling for a ban on people with HIV entering the UK. Mr Carswell said at the time: ‘No-one is seriously suggesting we should screen people for HIV coming in.’ Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive of HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘It was great to see so many people express outrage after Farage’s comments last night about the numbers of people in the UK with HIV who were not born here. ‘HIV is a public health issue in the UK and globally. If we do not take an inclusive approach and provide treatment for people who need it, we will never prevent onward transmission. ‘HIV doesn’t discriminate and politicians shouldn’t either. Such ill-informed and discriminatory comments generate stigma, and make it harder to encourage people to take a test and stay safe.’ Ed Miliband spoke of himself as a future prime minister ten times during the leaders’ debate on television. In his opening statement, the Labour leader said: ‘If I’m prime minister, I’ll raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour and ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so we’ll reward hard work again. ‘If I’m prime minister, I’ll rescue our NHS, hiring more doctors and nurses. ‘If I’m prime minister, I’ll build a future for all of our young people.’ On migration, he said: ‘If I’m elected as prime minister, we’ll put in place new rules which say that if you come to this country, you won’t get benefits for at least the first two years.’ On the failure of some employers to pay the minimum wage, he said: ‘We’ve got to deal with it, and if I’m prime minister, I will.’ Mr Miliband used the words ‘prime minister’ five more times, including in his summing-up."}

The Queen and senior members of the Royal Family will attend the Westminster Abbey service of thanksgiving - the culmination of three days of events marking the milestone. A chain of beacons will be lit across the country, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes will take to the skies and a star-studded concert will be held in London from May 8 to 10 as part of commemorations marking the 70th anniversary. The Queen will lead the nation at a religious service . On VE Day - May 8, 1945 - the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, famously joined the jubilant victory celebrations in London and danced the conga through the Ritz Hotel before joining crowds outside Buckingham Palace. Jean Woodroffe, one of the Queen's first ladies in waiting, when interviewed by the BBC to mark the monarch's 80th birthday in 2006 said: 'What was amusing is that we went into the Ritz hotel through one door and out of the other door, the other end, doing the conga.' She added: 'And then we stood outside Buckingham Palace with the crowd and we all shouted 'We want the King' with everybody else until the King and Queen came out onto the balcony.' On the first day of the festivities a national two-minute silence will be held at The Cenotaph at 3pm on Friday, May 8, marking the moment prime minister Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech to formally announce the end of the war. It will be followed by the lighting of more than 100 beacons, stretching from Newcastle to Cornwall. The next day cathedrals across the country will ring bells at 11am in celebration. In 1995, the Queen, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day . VE Day 50th Anniversary, 1995, showing enthusiastic crowds at Buckingham Palace . Many veterans were alive to celebrate for the anniversary in 1995, some will still be for the 70th this year . Stars will also perform at a 1940s-themed concert held on Horse Guards Parade in London in the evening, to be shown on the BBC. At the Sunday service the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will be joined by veterans and their families, politicians, members of the Armed Forces and representatives of Allied nations and Commonwealth countries that fought alongside Britain. A parade of bands, veterans and current servicemen and women will then make their way from the Abbey along Whitehall before a reception in St James's Park for 2,000 veterans hosted by the Royal British Legion. The parade will pass the balcony of the Treasury building, where Churchill made his historic speech before vast crowds on VE Day. That afternoon there will be a fly-past of current and historic aircraft from the RAF, including Hurricane, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Vehicles dating from the 1940s will also be on display in St James's Park. People are encouraged to enjoy their own celebrations by holding street parties. Announcing the three-day celebrations last month, William Hague, First Secretary of State, said they would pay 'fitting tribute' to those who did so much to defend the country and ensure victory in Europe. Winston Churchill waves at the crowd in Whitehall during VE Day celebrations on 8 May, 1945 . A Cheer Goes Up For George VI, his wife - later Queen Mother - and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 70 years ago on 8 May, 1945 . He said: 'It is right that we take time to reflect on the sacrifices made, not just by those in the Armed Forces, but by civilians such as Land Girls and those in Reserved Occupations and make sure that the whole country has the chance to take part in commemorating this momentous anniversary and remembering those who gave so much for our freedom. 'The celebrations in London will be echoed by other events across the country to mark VE Day 70, with local authorities and communities encouraged to participate. 'They will celebrate with members of their communities who contributed to the war effort throughout the Second World War.' The announcement of the VE Day celebrations came after the Queen attended the traditional Royal Maundy Service in Sheffield yesterday. Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty, dressed in a turquoise coat by Stewart Parvin and matching hat, was there to present 'alms' to 89 women and 89 men, among them D-Day veteran, Denis Gratton. 'It was just quick. I'm not very good at hearing,' said Mr Gratton, 91, after the ceremony. 'She did say something but I'm not sure what it were.' Handing out alms: The Queen presents a lady with the two Maundy Purses at Sheffield Cathedral . Custom: Monarchs have been presenting Maundy Money since 1210 and King John . The Queen, who had arrived on the Royal Train, was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag-waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers. Met at the church door by Peter Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, and the local Bishop, Steven Croft, Her Majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service. After the hour-long service, the Queen posed for pictures with the Yeoman of the Guard, who had lined the cathedral's aisles during the ceremony. The Royal party then left for a reception at Sheffield Town Hall as the recipients emerged into the sunshine, all pleased with their royal acknowledgement. Patricia Durkin, 72, said: 'It was brilliant, absolutely wonderful. When I got here the atmosphere was tremendous.' The Royal Maundy Service is one of the UK's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins. This year, the Red Purse contains a £5 coin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Commemorative: The red and white bags contain commemorative coins, this year featuring Winston Churchill . Tradition: The Queen and Prince Philip were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers . Historically, this sum of £5.50 in the Red Purse is made up of £3 for clothing, £1.50 in lieu of provisions and £1 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy Money, which, unlike coins in general circulation,   bear the portrait of the Queen produced by Mary Gillick at the start of her reign. Gillick, a sculptor, designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the UK and some Commonwealth countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968. The portrait of the Queen wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years. The Royal Maundy is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment Christ gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before Good Friday. Warm welcome: The Queen is greeted at Sheffield Cathedral ahead of the traditional Royal Maundy Service . Cheerful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on jolly form as he arrived for the service . In an echo of the Last Supper, mediaeval and Tudor monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service. Unlike the nosegay, which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell, that custom failed to survive the 18th century. The first monarch to take part in a Maundy Thursday service was King John, of Magna Carta and Robin Hood fame, who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in Knaresborough in 1210. John was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in Rochester in 1213. John's grandson Edward I, the king known to posterity as 'the Hammer of the Scots', was the first to confine the tradition to Maundy Thursday alone, which, until his reign, could be conducted on any day of the year. Long wait: Many of the well-wishers outside the Cathedral had waited there for hours . Modernising: The 800-year-old tradition used to involve washing beggars' feet - hence the nosegay . All smiles: The Queen, who has only missed the ceremony four times, was all smiles as she arrived . Smell: The scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people ."}

As a modest 34B I’ve experimented with every push-up, plunge and balcony bra there is, so I’m intrigued to learn of a new £150 bra that claims to take you from a B-cup to a DD in an instant. The Scandfit Try Size — dubbed ‘the boob-job bra’ — was developed to help women about to go under the knife decide what size implants to have. Not surprisingly, it has gained a following among women like me who would never have surgery but love the idea of trying out a dream decolletage for a day. Scroll down for video . At a size 34B, Annabel Cole (pictured without the bra)  has long dreamed of having a bigger bust but would never have surgery, so she decided to put 'the boob-job bra' through its paces . I decided to put the design through its paces in three variations — a C cup, D cup and whopping DD! Starting with the smallest first, this is what I found . . . FROM B-CUP TO C-CUP, BUT IT'S TOO SAGGY . Cleavage you can change like your clothes? Yes, please! I’m terribly excited by the idea of the Try Size — even more so when it arrives packaged in a white leather box. Soft, black and lace-trimmed, it comes with four pairs of inserts labelled one to four, according to their size. The inserts are measured in cubic centimetres, like surgical implants. The lightest, size one, weighs in at 50cc, followed by size two at 100cc, size three at 200cc and size four at 300cc. One added cup size is roughly equivalent to 200cc, and the idea is that the inserts can be layered in various combinations to create different sizes of cleavage. The Scandfit Try Size (pictured) has been dubbed ‘the boob-job bra’ and comes with four pairs of inserts which can be layered to create different sizes of cleavage . While the Try Size is pretty, it is also hefty. Out of curiosity I plonk it on my kitchen scales: the whole package weighs well over a kilo. I had assumed that the inserts would be silicone, but these are filled with rice and resemble silky bean bags. Apparently, rice is about the same weight by volume as surgical implants and can be moulded more realistically to your breast shape. Each bra cup has an internal pocket to hold the inserts. Annabel is seen here wearing the size three 200cc insert which takes her modest B cup to a C cup, she says she was sorely disappointed with the results of the rice filled insert on this occasion . I start cautiously with the size three 200cc insert, taking my modest B cup to a comelier C. The inserts prove easy to put in but the first hurdle comes with doing up the bra. Unlike those I usually wear, this has four rows of hooks — presumably to cope with the maximum potential weight — and it takes me a few extra minutes to get them fully done up. Once the bra is on, I feel let down. I’d been expecting some kind of ‘Hello Boys’ perky bosom but I’m sorely disappointed. What I get is more like a real-life middle-aged C cup — ever so slightly droopy and a little lopsided. But I persist and push around the rice, patting and smoothing until it creates a soft, rounded shape. I decide to try out my new look on my harshest critics — my children. I throw on a tight T-shirt and wander into the kitchen. As I load the dishwasher, 12-year-old Rosa peers at me and pipes up: ‘Your boobs look weird. What have you done?’ I come clean and explain. It doesn’t go well. Elsa, 15, snorts: ‘That’s pathetic!’ I try to explain that the bra simulates ‘real cleavage’ and that I am going to be trying out various looks. ‘Don’t bother,’ she snaps. ‘It makes you look fat.’ Ouch! CONFIDENT AND SEXY WITH  D-CUP . I decide to try my next look on a different audience. Reasoning that my closest friend Nancy is bound to be more supportive, I stuff my bra with the size three and size two inserts — 300cc in total — to give me a much-increased D cup. We’ve booked for lunch at a restaurant, but the problems start before I leave the house. What should I wear? I try on a succession of tunic tops and soft blouses. With a B-cup they look pretty and feminine, but now they are too short and the fabric hangs down from the shelf created by my new boobs. To my horror, I look decidedly fat. Annabel is seen here wearing the inserts that increase her bust size to 34D, although initially self-conscious of her significant cleavage, she was startled by how natural it made her boobs look . I resort to a clinging V-neck dress — a once-worn look-at-me frock bought for a wedding. It’s not what I’d normally wear, but I’m not dressing for myself now; I am dressing for my cleavage — and it’s certainly eye-catching. Nancy is terribly complimentary and I feel rather bouyed up, but as we sit down I feel the disapproving gaze of a couple of mums I recognise, who are lunching near by. Do I look desperate? At 43, am I too old to show off my cleavage? I feel self-conscious, but I press on. My husband and I have tickets to a West End show in the evening, so to ensure maximum impact I invest in an expensive low-cut dress on the basis that if I have ‘it’ (even temporarily) I might as well flaunt it. I am startled to see a new me in the mirror. The boobs look natural, not the typical half-moon shape that screams ‘boob job’, and I feel confident and sexier than usual. It works. My husband, not usually known for his ability to notice a new haircut, outfit or even one of his own children at a distance, cottons on instantly and compliments me in his own special way. ‘You have a figure at last! Does it go bigger?’ GETTING BACKACHE WITH DOUBLE Ds . Next, I try out the boob-job bra at the supermarket — and for this one, I decide to go all-in. With some trepidation I insert size four, size three and size two — 600cc in total. Instantly, I am three cup sizes bigger than I’ve ever been. My posture changes at once: I am pulled forward by the extra weight, leaving me hunched over and exposing a vast swathe of cleavage to my fellow shoppers. Pushing the trolley is even harder work than usual, and I now understand why women with large breasts complain of backache. My bust is enormous and looks wildly out of proportion with my 5ft 4in, size 8 frame. Even walking at a stately pace, my chest jiggles alarmingly. I bend down to pick a box of cereal off the bottom shelf and worry that I’m about to suffer a wardrobe malfunction. Finally, Annabel tested out the 600cc inserts that increased her bust size to a 34E cup. Annabel says she felt her bust became wildly out of proportion to her body as she is only 5ft 4in and a size 8 . I can’t ever imagine running for a bus with a bust like this. Things are no easier at home. I crouch down to sweep the floor and my chest hits my knees; I sit down for a snack and my bust slams on the table before the plate. And sleeping? As I lie down, my boobs separate and sag to the sides alarmingly. I toss and turn but can’t get comfortable. I usually sleep on my side, but then my chest feels squashed. It’s even worse on my front. I try to snuggle up to my husband but once again my DDs are in the way, though to judge by his reaction he doesn’t mind too much. Finally, I remove two of the inserts and drop off flat on my back. The next day, I slip back into my normal 34B bra with great relief. While I’ll be bringing out the D cup on a special occasion — my husband’s birthday, for example — the stop-the-traffic cleavage is far too much for me."}

Whatever your view, one thing’s for certain: when it comes to twins, particularly identical ones, they are an endless source of fascination. Yet, despite all this interest, the rest of us remain baffled, emotionally and scientifically, by the uncanny bonds identical twins share. Having spent a year researching twins for my new novel, I have come to realise that we are only beginning to grasp how strange they truly are and quite why they have compelled us for thousands of years. Ashley (left) and Mary-Kate Olsen (right) are two of the most famous twins in the world and despite their very similar appearances they are not actually identical twins . Take pre-colonial Brazilians, who thought twins were a product of adultery, resulting in the poor innocent mother often being executed for her supposed infidelity. Some primitive African societies abhorred twins because of the way multiple births resemble an animal’s litter. It wasn’t uncommon for the unlucky children to be slaughtered and their mother exiled. In Greek mythology, however, twins were believed to be the product of human intercourse with the gods, meaning they were sacred, while ancient Slavs maintained that twins shared one special soul. Not all monozygotic twins (i.e. twins born from a single fertilised egg) are truly identical. Some are ‘mirror image’ twins. This means that in one twin the hair might swirl clockwise, in the other twin it will swirl anticlockwise — but it will swirl in exactly the same way. For one twin, the left side of the mouth might curve upwards; in the other twin, the right side of the mouth has precisely the same curve. This peculiar ‘looking-glass effect’ extends to the positioning of internal organs. But many identicals are truly identical in ways we are still uncovering. Obviously, identical twins share facial characteristics and body shape. But they also share virtually identical DNA, meaning they are more closely related to each other than to anyone else, including their parents or their own children. Joel (left) and Benji Madden (right) are identical twins, it's likely that they will have grown more alike over time as their identical DNA asserts itself . A daring £5 million jewel heist was carried out at a Berlin department store in 2009. Closed-circuit TV showed one of three masked man removing a glove at the scene, which the police later recovered. The glove provided DNA evidence traced to identical twin brothers. But with no way of pinning it on one brother, both were acquitted. Identicals also share the same blood group, the same hormones, the same serum proteins; they are alike in heart rate, blood pressure, brain waves, respiratory rate and digestive process. Hospitals in America in the past have advised parents to discreetly tattoo one twin — with a tiny dot, or mark on a heel — so that in future the children can be differentiated. Parents often refuse, believing they will be able to distinguish their twins as they age (not least, by dressing them differently). This, however, can be a mistake because twins can grow more identical over time (as their identical DNA asserts itself, following different levels of nourishment in the womb). And twins often end up being dressed in exactly the same clothes anyway, lest one become jealous of the other getting ‘better’ treatment. Here, we enter the peculiar world of twin psychology. Over recent decades, scientists such as Thomas Bouchard, of the Minnesota Centre For Twin And Family Research, have analysed the personalities of twins and discovered seriously uncanny facts. Take the classic example of twins separated at birth. The extent to which they can echo each other in later life is breathtaking. One of my favourite cases is the separated twins who discovered, when reunited, that they both entered the sea on beach holidays by wading backwards up to their knees. Probably the most famous case of eerie identicality is that of Jim Lewis and Jim Springer. These identical American twins were separated when four weeks old, and adopted by different families in Ohio. When reunited at the age of 39, in 1979, they discovered that both of them suffered from tension headaches, both had worked as sheriff’s deputies and both smoked Salem cigarettes. Hunter (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) are fraternal twins and so do not share the same strong characteristics and traits as identical twins do . They also drove exactly the same kind of car and both enjoyed woodworking in the garage. Both had been named James by their respective adoptive parents, and both had married twice — first to women named Linda, then to women called Betty. Both had produced sons named James Allan. Both had at one time owned dogs named Toy. And they both took their holidays at the very same beach in Florida. Some parents of twins have reported their children having identical dreams. Others recount twins suffering pains, in the same part of the body, when only one of them is hurt. Doctors who observe twins in the womb have watched identicals do a strange kind of matching twin dance: the fetal twins come close to each other, face to face, then one of the twins makes a circle, and the other does the very same. It as if they are, in utero, telepathically aware of each other’s movements. Even in death, twins share an incredible bond. A prime, if rather dark, example is the 72‑year‑old brothers in Finland. In 2002, they were killed on their bicycles on the same road in Northern Finland in two accidents, two hours apart. When one twin survives the death of another, they likewise possess an oddness which startles. Author Joan Woodward, in her 2009 study of twin bereavement, reported several striking examples of twins’ reactions when one of them dies. Some young twins simply do not believe the death, and continue to act as if the lost twin is alive, talking to the dead sibling at breakfast, in a shared twin language, for instance. John and Edward Grimes, commonly known as 'Jedward', are identical twins. Some parents of identical twins have observed them having identical dreams or even suffering pain in the same parts of the body . Other infant twins seem painfully confused as to whether their twin is really gone, because they keep seeing the living image of their dead sibling in the mirror or in a reflecting window; when they see themselves, they see the sibling. By contrast, a few bereaved twin children deliberately seek out mirrors in order to reassure themselves their dead twin lives on. They want to see the living ghost. Other twins react differently still. Woodward records how some, following the death of a co-twin, take over their lost sibling’s characteristics and behaviour, as if trying to make up for the loss by actually becoming the dead sibling. One twin whose brother died at the age of 12 became so eerily like his dead sibling that his parents were convinced he had the ‘spirit of his brother within him’. Another female twin was so grief-stricken she took her dead sister’s name. These strange reactions surrounding the deaths of identicals can have effects beyond the twins themselves. During my research, I came across one wholly remarkable example of twin confusion, following a death. It happened in California in the Nineties (though the details and names have been protected by the authorities, for obvious reasons). One day, driving off on holiday, the Andersons — father, mother and their identical twin daughters Samantha and Katie — had a terrible crash. An ambulance was called and the victims were cut from the car. However, after reaching the hospital, Samantha soon died and Katie was left in a coma. It was a horrific loss, but life had to go on. The family concentrated on helping the hospitalised Samantha get over the death of her twin. A funeral for Katie was held. And yet, as her surviving daughter improved, mum Sally found it strange that Samantha behaved so much like her dead sister. Finally, Sally studied her child’s birthmark very closely (the twins had similar but not identical birthmarks) and realised a terrible mistake had been made — Katie had survived and Samantha had died. This realisation occurred two weeks after the accident. The Andersons had buried the ‘wrong’ daughter. It was reading that extraordinary true-life story — and all these other facts — that gave me the idea for a thriller. What would happen if the Andersons’ experience was repeated, but the family only discovered their error a year later? What ghostly consequences might ensue? Whatever the answer, one thing I know for sure is that twins will continue to fascinate us because they pose so many profound and unsettling questions. S. K.

Data bosses have been caught boasting to the Mail of the underhand tactics they use to trick homeowners into giving away their secrets. In meetings with our undercover reporters, they admitted ignoring an official no-call list meant to protect the vulnerable. And they said they could never be honest with people about the consequences of passing on personal information because then no one would answer their calls. ‘We’re a business at the end of the day,’ one told the Mail. ‘If we was [sic] to then turn round and say, “You’re now going to get 30 calls from this company, that company”, most of the people will probably say, “I don’t want it”. Because they know it’s going to be a sales call.’ Various firms offered to sell personal information to the Mail’s undercover team using data from lifestyle surveys completed by people who had been cold-called from overseas. They claimed that calling offshore meant they could disregard the official Telephone Preference Service (TPS) – even though the Information Commissioner’s Office said this was not true. Once they get people on the phone, the call centre workers ask them to complete a lifestyle survey. They start with ‘soft’ questions that seem harmless before going into ones about personal finances. While a brief disclaimer is read, bosses admitted victims do not realise answering the questions will lead to dozens of calls from different companies. Scroll down for video . The questions are sponsored by firms looking to target people with specific interests, and answers are sold on. So even if a caller has signed up to the TPS, saying yes to a survey question is seen to override this, giving the companies the green light to cold call them again. An undercover reporter from the Mail met David Light, account director at The Data Partnership (TDP), which has a 60-seater call centre in the Philippines and calls hundreds of thousands in Britain every month. Mr Light's company has a 60-seater call centre in the Philippines and calls hundreds of thousands in Britain every month. He explained that their tactics include starting with warm questions before going more financial . Asked if he thought people doing surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result he said 'generally I don't think some people realise that they're going to get calls' For 8p a record, Mr Light offered to sell the Mail information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago . He said: ‘So at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy, warm questions to open up – what is the age of your TV. ‘When you start going more financial – how much you’re earning, would you like a [pension] review – [they say] “no I’m not interested. I don’t want any sales calls. No, I’m going, bye”.’ Mr Light said any answers given before the call ended were taken as confirmation that the caller was happy to be on marketing lists in future. ‘I mean, we’re a business at the end of the day,’ he said. ‘When you try and dig into people’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information.’ So questions about finance were left to later in the call, he explained. Asked if he thought people doing the surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result, he said: ‘If I’m honest, and I’m always honest, generally I think some people don’t realise that they’re going to get calls.’ Mr Light said his firm try to get round the no-call list by ringing mobiles – which few realise can be on the TPS – and by calling from abroad. ‘The problem we’re having now, a lot of it might be on the TPS register. Hence why when we call out offshore,’ he said. ‘Certain companies will say to us, “Can you run it against the TPS file and tell us what you’ve got which is non-TPS?” OK, fine. But the volumes will drop drastically.’ Asked how the firm gets away with calling people registered with the TPS, he said: ‘Because it’s offshore.’ He claimed, wrongly, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regulations govern only calls within the UK. For 8p a record, Mr Light offered to sell the Mail information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago. The Data Partnership is run by John Pooley, 38, and his wife Victoria, 35, who claim they are the ‘good guys’ in ‘an industry rife with cowboys’. They started more than a decade ago from a garage in Chelmsford before turning it into a firm with a turnover of more than £2million. A spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any allegations which suggest TDP is in any way contravening the law or any recognised code of practice. Respondents to our telephone-based surveys are informed from the outset that our surveys are being carried out for marketing purposes. They are not for market research. If respondents “opt-in” they clearly expect to receive calls and be contacted again.’ Data firm Communication Avenue also admitted calling names on the TPS register from call centres in the Philippines, India and South Africa. Account manager Byron Highfield told us: ‘If you’re wanting to sponsor a question then no, we wouldn’t TPS it, because we have their name and they asked if they’re interested in receiving a call back.’ Communication Avenue is owned by Philip and Charlotte Lightfoot and is a rebranding of Phruit, which was suspended by the Direct Marketing Association in 2011 for calling people on the TPS and selling under the guise of research. The Data Partnership has strongly refuted allegations suggesting it is contravening the law or any recognised code of practice . The firm said it does not own offshore call centres but buys survey data from other firms, including The Data Partnership. Mr Lightfoot said: ‘Communication Avenue takes compliance very seriously.’ Steve Eckersley, the ICO’s head of enforcement, said: ‘Organisations cannot get around the law by pretending to conduct market or lifestyle research. Market research should be just that – market research without the intention of passing on people’s details. Using a foreign call centre does not get you out of your commitments to consumers.’ David Light said callers start with 'soft' questions like 'how old is your main TV in you property' Data Partnership’s David Light boasted to a Mail undercover reporter of the tactics used by his firm to coax information from people it cold calls. ‘When you try and dig into people’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information. ‘Like if you was to call me and say, “What’s your household income?”, I don’t wish to answer that. I don’t want to tell you what I’m earning. Because, I don’t know, you could be some lucrative crime gang, know where I live, know I earn over £50k a year, and you think right, well if he’s earning more than £50k a year, he’s probably going to have a nice car, he’s probably going to have some nice valuables in there. ‘So we find that when you get to them sort of questions, we leave them to the bottom of the survey. So at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy, warm questions to open up – How old is your main TV in your property? Is it less than one year, one to five years or five years plus? Which newspaper do you read? Do you have Sky through a satellite dish? Yes? OK, when’s your household insurance up for renewal? What month only. So soft questions. ‘When you start going more financial – how much you’re earning, would you like a [pension] review? – [they say] “No I’m not interested. I don’t want any sales calls. No, I’m going, bye”. They put the phone down. So we’ve only got the opt in for them answers what they’ve opted in. ‘If I’m honest, and I’m always honest, generally I think some people don’t realise that they’re going to get calls. I mean, we’re a business at the end of the day. If you go, “You’re going to get 30 calls on the back of this”, you’re going to get a consumer going, “I don’t want to tell you any information”. It’s natural, it’s human nature. ‘If we was to then turn round and say at the end of the survey call, “Right you’re now going to get 30 calls from this company, that company”, most of the people will probably say, “I don’t want it”. ‘Nine times out of ten they’ll probably say, “No I don’t want to be contacted by that company” because they know it’s going to be a sales call.’"}

Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video . Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Attack: Jamal al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died . Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran. Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department said 'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa."}

Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage of stroke patients who are affected by facial weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around £3,000 privately. The NHS does not automatically fund it ."}

Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor. Mr Dhillon's wife then appeared clutching her son's baseball bat and managed to subdue him further. Scroll down for video . Prolific thief Shaun Andrew McKerry was once dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' because he always returned home after his many crimes, and he has been unmasked as the axe wielding thief in an attempted post office robbery - where he was subdued by the owner who rugby tackled him and his wife with a baseball bat (left) McKerry was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s after he was arrested 80 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail. CCTV images show Mr Dhillon pouncing on 31-year-old McKerry, armed with an axe, from behind . Mr Dhillon and the terrified shop assistant (right) subdued McKerry and revealed his face for the cameras . Mr Dhillon tackled McKerry and both he and his wife said they did not realise his criminal history at the time . McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing £90 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing £90 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences."}

Abandoned: Charities have told MailOnline that state-appointed 'dog catchers' are rounding up dogs and taking them to holding pens where they are 'waiting to die' Attack: Pola from K-9 Angels (pictured) she says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs' Brutal: The Angels claim government funds for programmes which were designed to neuter dogs were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way' They say the state-appointed catchers round up dogs and take them to holding pens where they can be 'clubbed to death' and set on fire. Pola told MailOnline: 'Romania's stray dog situation is probably one of the worst in Europe and sad, neglected, hungry animals are a part of Romanian landscape. She says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs'. Adding: 'Tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers and killed in most horrific ways. 'It is common in Romania for them not to use a euthanasia injection, but instead dispose of dogs in cheaper ways such as injecting paint thinner into the heart, strangling, clubbing to death.' The founders of K-9 Angels describe the pounds as 'filthy, dirty, short on food'  and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public'. Here, the dogs suffer from mange - a skin disease caused by parasitic mites - and fights between them erupt regularly. Despite the harsh conditions they are subjected to, the animals who are lucky enough to be alive still vie for the Angels' affection when they are eventually rescued. Animal charity Four Paws - which has helped neuter around 150,000 stray dogs - says the situation for dogs became much worse when the killing law was introduced. Its spokesperson Adam Rahman told MailOnline: 'Dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment, and are essentially waiting to be killed. 'The organisation responsible for catching the dogs estimated that they had captured around 25,000 stray dogs in Bucharest alone since the legislation was passed, and overseen the killing of around 16,000.' The organisation successfully convinced the Bucharest Court of Appeal to suspend the legislation last summer, but they say the brutal situation on the streets remains the same.

Happy home: Tommy - who was found malnourished in the back of a rundown car - is now living comfortably in the UK . Desperate: They also found Mabel (pictured) at a train station in an appalling condition and a severe wound on her left paw . Happy ending: Mabel - whose leg was crushed - is one of the lucky ones to be rescued but 16,000 dogs have been culled since it was legalised at the end of 2013 . Inspired: The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook . Earlier this month, the charity found evidence of a massive and illegal cull of stray dogs in the small southern town of Clinceni. They discovered dozens of dead dogs with visible wounds on their heads and bodies left to rot in black bags in the forest. 'This is another serious violation of the law on stray animals and proof that, although the killing law has been repealed since June 20, 2014,' Four Paws said. The cull is supposed to reduce the overpopulation of stray dogs in the country but a World Health Organisation report claimed: 'In none of the study areas did the elimination of dogs by any method (catching, shooting or other) have any significant long-term effect on dog population size.' The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook. It was the plight of that dog - named Angel - that inspired the trio to officially form the organisation in November 2011. Their petition to calling on the European Union to investigate the 'disappearance' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures. Gruesome: Charity Four Paws discovered dozens of dogs with severe wounds to their head and bodies in the a southern Romanian town . Grotesque: While another charity Dog Rescue Romani claim to see piles of dead dogs left on village roads . A rescue worker with Dog Rescue Romani said they regularly see piles of dead dogs left in the middle of village roads when they patrol the south-west of Romania. Its spokesperson Marius Costache told MailOnline: 'The scenes are such that alive dogs and some puppies were eating from the other dead dogs within the pile. 'We asked someone who said they saw a large truck passing by at 3.30am that night who dumped the pile and left. 'We called our local police right at that moment and the answer was 'so what do you want us to do?' 'With the euthanasia law or without, it the slaughter in Romania public shelters or streets will continue.' Between March and May 2014, a team of investigators from Four Paws investigated 43 public shelters in Romania – from around 81 currently registered with the Romanian vet authorities. The results of the investigation were shocking  as they found that not one of these public shelters in Romania conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs."}

On average, we rest our weary heads on our pillows for more than 2,500 hours — or the equivalent of more than 100 days and nights — per year, so it’s certainly worth getting the right one. And while once our choice was limited to feather or fibre, the shops are now stuffed with everything from water pillows to scented pillows, and even one which is wired for sound. But which is a pain in the neck and which is a dream come true? SUPER COOL . Buckwheat Hull Pillow, £22.99, livingiseasy.co.uk . In Tudor times, buckwheat pillows were so prized that grandmothers handed them down to their grandchildren. My children aren’t quite as easily pleased. When I showed them this thick, heavy pillow with an industrial-looking cotton cover, they weren’t impressed. This feels like a giant, heavy beanbag and looks like a prop from Wolf Hall. Billed as the ultimate eco-pillow, it’s filled with the tiny husks which protect the kernel of the buckwheat grain. In summer, you can chill it in the fridge for a few hours to keep you cool throughout the night. It also soothes stiff muscles — as the chill will reduce inflammation and help numb any pain. It doesn’t look impressive, but it shapes beautifully around my shoulders and neck. It makes a slight rustling as the tiny hulls shift, but I had a great night’s sleep. All I needed was Mark Rylance beside me, and my dream would have been complete. 4/5 . MARRIAGE SAVERS . Reversible Foam Pillow, £35, marksandspencer.com . I’ve had some spectacular rows over pillows. My husband, Ray, likes a firmer pillow, while I like a lovely soft one, but I hate buying different types as we inevitably get them mixed up and we both have a bad night. Can M&S solve the dilemma with this unique two-sided pillow? One side — made from a very firm memory foam — suits Ray perfectly, but is far too rigid for me. The other side, made from synthetic microfibre filling, is perfectly soft and squishy. At 6in thick, it’s a little higher than some we tried, but this clever pillow still gave me a good night’s sleep. We both woke up happy, and that’s good enough for me! 4/5 . A SMELLY SNOOZE . Silent Night Febreze Pillow, £9.99, argos.co.uk . I was hoping for the soft scent of lavender gently lulling me to sleep, but instead I got a rather sickly synthetic pong wafting up from the filling. Definitely more lavatory than lavender. The lightweight pillow made of polyester didn’t improve my sleep any more than any other ones I tried. Synthetic fillings are the most popular type of pillows in the UK, because they are cheap. But let’s face it, if I wanted the scent of Febreze at bedtime, I’d be better off spraying Ray as he lay beside me snoring. At 3.5in thick, it is soft but offers little support, and I woke feeling uncomfortable and grumpy. 1/5 . SO SOFT. . . AND CHEAP! Lidl Microfibre Pillows, £3.49, Lidl . Budget pillows tend to be thin, bounce-free and crackling with static electricity. So I was delighted to find these bargain-basement microfibre-filled pillows are generously stuffed and incredibly silky to touch. Because they are filled with bundles of ultra-fine synthetic fibre, the pillows are wonderfully soft. My 16-year-old daughter, Ruby, the fussiest sleeper since the princess and the pea, declared it the best pillow she had ever tried. A similar synthetic pillow from John Lewis would set me back £35, which makes this — at under a fiver — a total winner. Synthetic pillows have the shortest lifespan of all — from six months to two years before they flatten or fall out of shape — but at this price, who cares. This pillow is just under 4in thick, but flattens due to the synthetic filling, so if you prefer height you’ll need two. 5/5 . WHEEZE-FREE SLEEP . Sleepangel Memory Foam Filter Pillow, £59, sleepangelworld.com . More dust mites live in the bedroom than anywhere else in the house — and they make a beeline for warm bedding. This anti-allergy pillow contains a four-layer filter designed to block germs, bacteria, mould and allergens. The waterproof, wipe-clean cover is heat-sealed, with no seams or needle marks to let in germs. It sounds impressive, but to test the effectiveness I used a pillow for three months before sending it to an independent laboratory. Scientists took samples of the foam filling and confirmed it was completely free of any nasties. With a 13-year-old son who suffers from asthma — a condition often triggered by mould and dust mites — this was reassuring. It is 3.5in thick, with little give thanks to the memory foam filling. The price tag is hefty, but totally worth it for a wheeze-free son. I’ve passed this on to Charlie for an unbroken night of sleep. 4/5 . MUSIC TO MY EARS . Sound Asleep Pillow, £17.99 firebox.com . Since my three children became teenagers, the task of persuading them to go to bed at night has become my worst nightmare. Could this high-tech pillow — wired for sound as they plug in their iPods to the external lead which connects to a speaker hidden inside — work miracles? Certainly, it’s the only time I’ve ever seen them excited about going to bed, and I was stunned to see my son Archie jump in before I’d issued a single threat. But the sort of music I hear thumping out of his pillow minutes later isn’t exactly restful! Luckily, the pillow muffles the sound for the rest of us. The pillow is not very thick (at 3in deep) or supportive. A winner for anyone aged 13-19 and for parents who are desperate for peace and quiet! 3/5 . THE GOLDEN GOOSE . Hungarian Goose Down Pillow, £88 For Two, soakandsleep.com . Down pillows are the softest and most luxurious type available and often come with a price tag to match. These ones are made by a small family firm in Hungary. The filling is washed in thermal spring water — so there are no nasty chemicals involved. Each pillow is double-stitched for strength and edged with gold piping for luxury you’ve never seen outside a five-star hotel. No wonder these pillows have amassed their own online following — as well as demand from top hotels around the world. Feels like sleeping on a giant marshmallow — it really is a luxury treat. Just one sumptuous pillow, measuring 5in thick — was enough for a perfect night’s sleep. 5/5 . LIKE SLEEPING ON A SPACE HOPPER . Mediflow Waterbase Pillow, £39.99, amazon.co.uk . Water pillows are fast becoming a trend — to keep cool or help sore necks and shoulders. They contain a pouch that you fill with water by opening the rubber seal, and pouring your water in. This means you can actually choose the height of your own pillow, depending on how you sleep best. My first attempt at filling it goes wrong. I pour so much water inside that it feels like I’m sleeping on a Space Hopper. A thermal insulator keeps the water cool, while an anti-allergy cushion of polyester fibres surround the inner water chamber, making it look and feel like any other pillow. The first night didn’t go well, as my neck felt too high. But I simply let water out the next day, taking the pillow from 5in thick to 3in, and I slept like a baby. 3/5 . WOOLLY WONDER . Fogarty Wool Pillow, £24.99, dunelm-mill.com . Wool is nature’s best temperature regulator — staying cool in summer and warm in winter. But can a pillow stuffed with wiry wool instead of lovely bouncy feathers offer as much comfort? The answer is yes. As I sink into the warm pillow I feel instantly comforted. Wool naturally absorbs moisture and scientists say the average sleeper gives off nearly a pint of water vapour. If you suffer from menopausal night sweats, this can rise to well over that. Once absorbed, the moisture quickly evaporates from the porous wool cells, so what looks like a normal pillow is actually a natural air conditioning unit. at 3in thick, this pillow is thinner and has less give, but it supported my sore neck — strained as I walked the dog — well. I slept well and woke feeling cool and refreshed. 3/5 ."}

A new book has now archived the changing face of Italian fashion, from the post-war years to the 21st century. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day, captures the evolution of Mediterranean style through 300 iconic dresses and archived images. Model Joan Olsen (left) shows off bold linear prints in an outfit by haute couture designer/artist Livio de Simone in 1954. Co-author Enrico says that Italian glamour is not 'sophisticated or artificial' The book was compiled by Enrico Quinto and Paolo Tinarelli - the two men who  were the first to introduce the concept of vintage style in Italy . The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers. A woman wears a structural suit by Fernandi, at a time when Italian fashion was beginning to break away from Parisian style . In the mid-fifties, Emilio Frederico Schuberth created an outfit which had a removable over-skirt so that the wearer could opt for a straight or flared silhouette . Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period.

Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones . Model Liliana Mongini wears Germana Marucelli in January 1950. Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer - her designs were on several occasions interpreted by Christian Dior . In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. Germana Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer, and her designs were, on several occasions, interpreted by Frenchman Christian Dior. The book also examines how trends developed over the years and iconic celebrity moments that would cement a designer's fame. One in particular came in 1956, when Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival. Schuberth became known as the 'tailor to the stars', and also catered for the likes of Rita Hayworth and Brigitte Bardot. His students included Valentino Garavani - who continues to be an Italian powerhouse today. Impossibly glamorous: In 1956, Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival . This dress by Emilio Schuberth cemented his position as 'tailor to the stars' Late sixties and early seventies creations from Fendi, including the bag with the signature interlocking Fs (right) Examples of humble beginnings are especially surprisingly when looking at labels such as Fendi - who originally came into existence as a leather and fur shop in Rome. From the mid-Sixties, Karl Lagerfeld was involved in the design of Fendi's logo with the interlocking F letters. Several designers in the book, such as Federico Forquet, are no longer operational, but were important in influencing and shaping the overall movement and progression of Italian fashion. The book also highlights how certain Italian designers, such as Roberto Carpucci, were propelled to fame when clothes were featured in advertorials - eventually appearing in publications such as Vogue. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . Renowned Italian designer, Roberto Carpucci's structural designs featured in Vogue Italia in 1982 . A defining moment for Italian fashion was circa 1994; Elizabeth Hurley stepped out in a Versace safety pin gown that was to become one of the most iconic dresses of all time. From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an accessible beauty - simple and natural.' Elizabeth Hurley in 1994 (left), pictured with then-beau, Hugh Grant (right) wearing the Versace dress that would go down in fashion history . Liz Hurley's dress (pictured) was a creation from Gianni Versace's spring/summer 1994 collection . In fact, Italian style has made a huge contribution to the fashion industry today, with Milan Fashion Week still a crucial part of the circuit, and with young models such as Kendall Jenner flocking to Milan every year. Popular culture figures such as Rihanna, are also active lovers of the Italian style. Rihanna recently customised a Fendi Baguette bag for a charity auction, along with Sarah Jessica Parker.

Successful models such as Kendall Jenner (pictured) flock to Milan Fashion Week every season to walk in shows such as Dolce & Gabbana (left - Autumn/Winter 2015, right - Spring/Summer 2015). Italian style is very much still crucial to the fashion landscape . In terms of the state of Italian glamour now, Enrico argues that it is a changing landscape, but something that maintains its simplicity. 'Italy has become more global and the melting pot of different nationalities has automatically brought new influences into Italy's lifestyle. 'I believe that  the essence of Italian glamour is based on a certain 'minimalism'. Clothing still has to be practical and adapted to an understated lifestyle. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day (Skira Editore) is out on 30 March 2015."}

While many of us have accepted what seemed like the inevitable every month and suffered through them armed with an arsenal of painkillers, hot water bottles and chocolate (while those nearest and dearest to us run for cover), one doctor claims that our PMS can be banished forever with just a few simple steps. 'Premenstrual symptoms such as irritability and cravings are common, but they're not normal,' Dr Lara Briden tells Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Common, but not inevitable: While Premenstrual symptoms such as irritability, cravings and fatigue have become accepted by most women as normal, one doctor claims it shouldn't be so . Dr Briden, a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women's health, recounts a patient who was suffering with PMS whom she helped by changing her eating habits. 'At 34, Julie was a bubbly, energetic person. She was happily married with two school aged children, and worked three days per week as a dental hygienist. \"I feel well most of the time,\" she told me. \"But then, five days before my period, everything changes. I suddenly feel headachy and fatigued. I get snappy with my husband and my kids, and I can't seem to stop myself.\" Happy days: The naturopathic doctor says that PMS can be banished for good by adapting an anti-inflammatory diet . 'I ordered some blood tests for Julie, and found that her hormones were normal, which is typical for PMS. Some doctors would offer the birth control pill at this point, but I know there's a better way. 'I asked Julie to stop eating desserts and deep-fried foods. Julie also took the nutritional supplements magnesium and vitamin B6, and within the very first month, she noticed a dramatic change. \"I was surprised when my period just arrived,\" she said. \"I didn't even feel it coming.\" That's why I love treating PMS. It responds so well to natural treatment.' Breakfast: . Option 1. Unsweetened muesli with mixed berries and unsweetened greek yoghurt . Option 2. Two scrambled eggs on whole grain or gluten-free toast with butter . Option 3. Spinach and goat cheese frittata . Beverages: Water, tea or coffee . Unsweetened muesli with berries (left) and scrambled eggs (right) are among Dr Briden's suggested breakfasts in her 'No-More-PMS' diet plan . Snacks: . Option 1. Handful of raw cashews . Option 2.

Dessert: . Option 1. Two squares of 85 per cent cocoa dark chocolate . Option 2. Cinnamon poached pears . Option 3. Gluten-free almond and orange torte made with half the sugar . Dr Briden explains that PMS has often been dismissed as a myth in the past, but that new research has indicated a link between inflammation and PMS. 'PMS has been a controversial diagnosis because researchers have not been able to detect any difference in the blood levels of hormones of PMS-sufferers compared to non-PMS-sufferers,' says Dr Briden. 'In both groups, oestrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall throughout the month just like they're supposed to. 'That has led some researchers to dismiss PMS as a myth, but I see it another way. Hormonal: PMS is caused by your response to the drop in hormones, which depends on the health of your hormone receptors... A primary cause of unhealthy receptors is chronic inflammation . 'Of course PMS-sufferers have normal hormone levels. That's because female hormones are not the actual cause of PMS. Why did we ever think they would be? Neither oestrogen nor progesterone are inherently bad for mood. Quite the opposite. They're both beneficial for mood because they boost neurotransmitters such as serotonin. 'I've worked with thousands of PMS patients, and I'm convinced: PMS is not caused by hormones, or even by the drop in hormones (which is inevitable at the end of the menstrual cycle). Instead, PMS is caused by your individual response to that drop in hormones. Dr Lara Briden has been a naturopathic doctor specialising in women's health for 20 years . 'This is where it gets interesting. Your response to hormones depends on the health and resilience of your hormone receptors, which are the tiny docking stations for your female hormones, and are found in every tissue, including your brain. 'Your hormone receptors translate hormonal messages into real physical effects such as mood or appetite. 'When your receptors are healthy, they're flexible, and they adapt to rising and falling hormone levels by simply dialling up and dialling down their response (depending on the level of hormone). That means no PMS. 'When your receptors are not healthy, on the other hand, they cannot adapt to changing hormones, and that leads to premenstrual symptoms. 'Fortunately, we know what impairs the health of hormone receptors: Chronic inflammation. According to a recent study, blood markers of inflammation are higher in PMS-sufferers. Chronic inflammation is a kind of long-term immune activation that is caused by different things including stress and smoking. It's also caused by certain inflammatory foods, and that's why diet is so effective as PMS treatment.' Off the table: Deep fried and sugary foods are the most inflammatory, and therefore should be avoided . EAT FEWER INFLAMMATORY FOODS . The most inflammatory foods are deep-fried foods and high-sugar foods such as desserts and sweet drinks, so you should avoid those. You should also avoid fruit juice because it is concentrated sugar. Whole fruit is permitted. Sugar and deep fried foods are inflammatory for everyone, but other foods, such as wheat and dairy products, can also be inflammatory if you have a sensitivity to them. Food sensitivities are well known to cause symptoms such as sinus or eczema, but they are also a common cause of PMS. Try avoiding wheat and dairy for three months, and see the difference. If in doubt, speak to your doctor or nutritionist. Tip: PMS is a common symptom of food sensitivities. Eat the rainbow: Brightly-coloured fruits and vegetables such as berries, spinach and kale provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium . EAT MORE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOODS . The foods that actively reduce inflammation are fruits and vegetables, especially the brightly coloured ones such as berries, spinach, and kale. Fruit and vegetables are anti-inflammatory because they provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium, and because they provide phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are beneficial plant compounds that stimulate your immune system and to reduce its inflammatory response. Supplements: Dr Briden recommends mineral magnesium and vitamin B6 to supplement diet . SUPPLEMENT WITH NATURAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY NUTRIENTS . My favourite anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement is the mineral magnesium. Together with vitamin B6, magnesium has done extremely well in clinical trials for premenstrual syndrome. Both supplements are safe and easy to obtain. Speak to your chemist. Tip: The No-More-PMS Diet works to prevent PMS. Please follow it during all the days of your cycle - not just when you're premenstrual. Lara Briden is a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women's health. She's just released her new book Period Repair Manual: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1942, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in Tom Brokaw's very large footsteps at NBC, according to a new report. The network handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003. But according to a report in Vanity Fair, Williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about Brokaw, whom he succeeded at Nightly News in 2004. 'I always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities,' one executive told the publication. Clash: Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams are pictured in New York in 2004 - the year Williams took over Brokaw's role on the Nightly News. A new report has claimed Williams always felt insecure following him . 'And he had to follow Tom, which brought its own set of insecurities. He likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales... I just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality.' But according to former correspondents who spoke to Vanity Fair, Brokaw wasn't so accepting of the 'quirks'. The stories left him 'incensed', the publication reported. On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day. On hearing the tale, Brokaw went into 'spasms of anger', one former exec told Vanity Fair. 'Tom treated that anchor chair as a public trust,' a former employee said. 'He really was our Walter Cronkite.' Others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after Williams took over the role because even though Brokaw pushed for him to get the job, Williams never 'embraced' him. 'I don't know why,' a source said. '[Williams] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did Tom, so he never tries. That's the reason there's not a lot of support for Brian over there.' Exaggerations: During a report in February, pictured, Williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a Chinook that came under fire while in Iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft . It also meant that when Williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed Chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - Brokaw didn't have his back. A friend told the publication that while Brokaw - who was 'livid' about the scandal - didn't call for Williams to be punished, he 'didn't try to save him either.' Following the suspension, Williams reportedly declared to a friend: 'Chalk one up for Brokaw.' Not impressed: Brokaw, pictured in February, came 'incensed' when he heard Williams' exaggerations . The article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident, Williams couldn't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead, he suggested he might have a brain tumor. '(He said,) 'Did something happen to (my) head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head',' a source said. 'He just didn't know. We just didn't know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best (apology) we could get.' When it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident, NBC quickly learned Williams himself would be of no help. 'He was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place, slash misrepresented it, slash lied,' one insider said. Others suggested that the problem with Williams' work was because the newscaster, who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at Nightly News, had no interest in reporting on war stories or 'heavy' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors. His appearance on late-night talk shows and comedy series, such as 30 Rock, suggested that instead of getting into gritty news, he actually wanted his own talk show, Vanity Fair suggested. While some NBC employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered, others say it did not go down well with the network. 'He didn't want to leave New York,' one source said. 'Getting him to war zones was real tough... but when he did go, he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things.' In February, Williams was forced to admit that he wasn't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003  - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years. 'Overwhelmed': Sources told Vanity Fair that Williams, pictured in Iraq, did not want to report on 'hard' news and didn't enjoy politics or war stories, and lacked the experience of his predecessors . Lies: During a report in 2003, he reported how a Chinook, pictured, had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down. In fact, he was on one about 30 minutes behind . It came after he claimed on the Nightly News in January that his aircraft had been hit, causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved. Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Even though Williams learned about the uproar over his false story on Facebook, he failed to bring it up with NBC execs when he met with them the next day, suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff, former employees told Vanity Fair. Days after the false report, he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter. 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' While Williams initially believed he'd be back to work within days, he was ultimately suspended for six months, and he accepted that he had to step back, sources said. NBC Nightly News is now being anchored by Lester Holt and it is unclear if Williams will return. Questions: A number of Williams' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. But in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams said he saved two puppies. In the same Esquire interview, Williams also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years, Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Earlier this year, he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' He was later suspended over the incident. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update."}

Many popular Easter eggs contain more sugar than is recommended in a day by the World Health Organisation . There is nothing as synonymous with Easter as chocolate eggs. A survey released this week found the average child will eat eight of the chocolate treats, totalling a massive 8,000 calories over the long weekend. But while the holiday might be a child's favourite, a nutritionist has warned too much sugar can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay. Dr Sam Christie, a nutrition scientist, also warned too much of the sweet stuff can exacerbate polycystic ovarian syndrome and behavioural problems like ADHD. The World Health Organisation recommends 50g of added sugar a day (roughly 12 and a half teaspoons), on top of natural sugars that occur in fruit and milk. Dr Christie has calculated that many popular eggs contain more than the recommended daily amount of sugar. Nestle Crunch Medium Easter Egg contains 182 per cent of the recommended daily amount, while a Thorntons Cupcake Medium Easter Egg has 161 per cent. Depending on how physically active the children are, eating too much sugar could trigger insulin resistance, Dr Christie said. This is where the body becomes de-sensitised to insulin, the hormone that controls how much sugar is in the bloodstream. Over time this slowly damages cells and organs in the body, and leads to type 2 diabetes. She said: 'Sugar causes pathological changes, their bodies become resistant to insulin  and have cellular damage to all parts of the body.' It also leads to weight gain. ‘Insulin resistance puts you at a metabolic disadvantage to lose weight. It actually becomes very hard to lose weight once the body can’t break down sugar,’ she explained. ‘Dermatologists used to say “chocolate and sugar doesn’t harm skin”. Now they are saying ‘yes they do’. She added children could also become deficient in other nutrients too. She said: 'If someone's overstraining their insulin system they lose more nutrients in urine, as do trace elements like zinc. They fall into deficit. 'You can upset metabolism by having too much sugar.' Eating too much sugar can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, tooth decay, nutrient deficiencies, acne and behavioural problems, a nutritionist warns . This can also lead to other deficiencies as children may fill up on sugar but not eat other, more nutritious food, so they miss out on vitamins and minerals, she added. Having a healthy diet the rest of the year can actually protect against the damaging effects of insulin resistance, which sugar might trigger. ‘Eat wholegrains, fruit and veg, portions of oil rich fish - the nutrients in foods will help make the body more sensitive to insulin. ‘If someone takes multi-vitamins, it helps sensitise the body to insulin, so you’re more likely to burn off sugar. ‘We fail to eat our micronutrients every day and it can actually help the nation become less obese.’ She added that if a person is going to overindulge,  solid chocolate eggs are better for health than ones with sugary fillings. She said: 'Any of the ones with pure chocolate rather than squidgy fillings are better. 'I'd avoid fondant or caramel, and go for solid chocolate. 'Then you'll be eating more polyphenols and less added sugar. 'The squidgy ones have added sugar on top of the sugar in cocoa.' Eating a small treat, rather than gorging on multiple eggs, allows children to enjoy easter without risking their health, she continued. She said: 'Eat a crème egg or a solid egg’s worth, something that can sit on your child's hand instead of covering their entire dinner plate.' Dr Christie recommends Nature’s Best Multi-Guard Balance vitamin supplement, which has added chromium, cinnamon bark and magnesium and claims  to stave off sugar cravings and boost energy levels."}

This week Hutton has released 'My Love Affair with Food' in collaboration with the Australian Women's Weekly, featuring over 40 recipes as well as some of her cherished food memories and personal photos. The 53-year-old media personality shared her favourite recipes from the book with Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for recipes . Cooking credit: Media personality Deborah Hutton has added 'cookbook author' to her accolades . Despite having a health and wellbeing website, Hutton has chosen not to buy into the 'diet/health cookbook' trend and is bringing back wholesome cooking and real food recipes that make her happy - salt and carbs inclusive. 'I've always had a love affair with food, I love cooking food, shopping for it and while it's always been a challenge since my  modelling days to both enjoy food but still fit into the clothes I like, I think if you set yourself up for a too strict routine you’ll fall off the wagon at some point,' says Hutton. 'There’s enough health books out there, I'm not about to do one,' she said. 'While it’s good to have your diet cookbooks and no sugar,  these recipes are about the things that make me happy.' And if Hutton's confession that 'a gin and tonic and salty chips' after a day on the golf course is one of the things that makes her happy, the cook book is sure to appeal. Confessed carb lover: Hutton bucks 'health trend' in favour of wholesome food - salt and carbs included . Crisp comfort: The 'Crispy Cheese Ravioli' as featured in 'My Love Affair with Food' Ingredients . Method . 1. Place the egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. 2. Half fill a deep-fryer or large saucepan with oil and heat to 190°C (the oil is hot enough when a cube of bread dropped in the oil turns golden in 30 seconds). Dip each ravioli in egg, then toss in the breadcrumbs, to coat. Working in batches of five, fry the ravioli for 1–2 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. 3. Meanwhile, heat the pasta sauce in a small saucepan over low heat until hot. Season to taste and stir in chopped basil; transfer to a heatproof serving bowl. 4. Arrange the ravioli on a platter, sprinkle with the extra parsley or basil and serve with the sauce for dipping. Note: If you prefer not to use a cheese filling, any ravioli works just as well. Time: 25 minutes . Serves: 4-6 . This dish makes you look like a star without really trying. I like to quickly cook these after everyone has arrived, so the cheese is still warm and gooey. Just ask your guests to pass the platter. While she is an advocate of juicing, Hutton also believes overall diet trends just don't work. 'I’ve tried just about everything but as a general rule of thumb I don't think fad diets are sustainable, you need a balance. So while I don’t like things  too deep fried or have a sweet tooth, I will take salt and carbohydrates any day, that’s my weakness.' Not to say Hutton isn't a advocate of good health  though. In 2011 she was diagnosed with skin cancer (only two years after her brother had lost the battle to liver cancer) and spent  weeks thereafter in hospital with a face full of stitches. This scare put her life in perspective and now other than a glass or two of wine in the evening, health is her number one priority. Hutton is now an ambassador for the Skin and Cancer Foundation, the founder of Balance by Deborah Hutton - a community website for women 40+ that focuses on sharing health and wellbeing information, and as mentioned, is an avid golfer who regularly spends time on the course. She also confesses that while known for  religiously slip, slop, slapping, in an ironic twist of fate, her doctor recently told her she's now lacking in vitamin D and calcium. Sexy soufflé: Hutton says her banana soufflé is the ultimate date night dessert and is sure to impress . And in Hutton's good humoured nature, she is taking it in her stride and using the news to her foodie advantage. 'When she told me I was highly deficient in both vitamin D and calcium I said - \"so basically I get to play out in the sun and eat cheese?\" and she said yes, and I laughed and told her I loved her!' In her new cook book, you can expect both 'naughty things' 'and 'really good things'. Ingredients . Method . 1. Cook penne in a large saucepan of boiling well-salted water until just tender; drain, cover to keep warm. 2. Heat oil in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, chilli, zucchini and rind. Cook gently for 1-2 minutes or until softened but not browned. 3. Return the hot pasta to the saucepan with the butter and fetta. Toss together and season to taste. Serve topped with parmesan. Note: Remove the seeds from the chillies for a milder flavour. Cooking time:  20 minutes . Serves: 4 . Trust me when I say, that once you’ve had this, you’ll be back for more. There’s something really refreshing about the crunch of the raw zucchini and the zesty lemon. 'You won’t find it heavy in the dessert section or deep fried, or too many ingredients or eight hours of preparation,' she said. 'There is an amazing chocolate panettone in there. I'd only have that maybe once a year, so not often but I had to include it!' Another favourite is the 'Mediterranean Chicken' which she says is not only delicious but a regular on her entertaining menu because it's easy and means 'you’re not strapped to the kitchen while everyone else is having fun.' Day on the green: An avid golfer, Hutton loves nothing more than a gin and hot chips after a day on the course . And at 53, life is only getting better for Hutton. She has a second cook book in the works focusing  on her love of entertaining and she's more invested than ever in inspiring and supporting women via her website Balance by Deborah Hutton. 'Turning 50 I wanted to be the best version of myself and it really is just getting better. Originally I was excited to turn 40 but I love what I’m doing now. I’m invested in this business - I want to help and connect with women and I also want to inspire people to get in the kitchen,' says Hutton . 'Afterall, there’s no time like the present and I’ve never felt more empowered.' Cheers to that: The 'Venice Dusk' cocktail as featured in 'My Love Affair with Food' Ingredients . Method . 1. Cut rind from watermelon; cut flesh into 2cm cubes, place in a ziptop bag; freeze for 1 hour or until ready to use. 2. Half fill a jug with ice cubes, frozen watermelon and mandarin rind. Stir vodka and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves; stir mixture into jug with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately. Note: Aperitifs are made by infusing herbs and/or fruit in alcohol and water; they have a bitter taste and are characterised by their dark red colour. Use an aperitif such as Aperol or Campari. Cooking time:15 minutes + freezing . Makes: 8 cups . Deborah's perfect menu for date night that is sure to impress any guest . Drink one: A Vodka Martini . Entrée:  A dozen freshly shucked oysters . Main: The sexy pea and mint risotto with additional seared scallops on top. Drink two: A Dry Riesling from the Clare Valley . Dessert: The banana soufflé - it's low fat, has no sugar and the presentation makes you look like a killer chef! Fresh off the press: The new book is on sale this week for $14.95 ."}

Sydney couple Epiphany Morgan and Carl Mason produced 365 documentaries in as many days, visiting 35 countries and 70 cities, as part of their project 365 Docobites, an idea which even the couple originally doubted would actually work. 'The idea only popped into my head about seven months before we hopped on the plane. When I first told one of my friends what we were thinking of doing, she asked whether I was sure it was a good idea,' Epiphany told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Epiphany Morgan and Carl Mason produced 365 documentaries in 365 days while travelling to 35 countries . With only seven months to organise everything, Epiphany, 23, left her job at a film production company to freelance and work towards their dream, while Carl, 27, continued to work as a senior editor at an advertising agency. 'When we told our friends and family what we were planning on doing, they didn't really believe us. They kept asking, 'are you sure you're going to be able to do that?',' Carl said. 'Honestly, I didn't even believe we were going until about month before we left when Epiphany told me that everything was in order for us to leave,' he said. With a strict budget of $40 a day, the couple set off to their first destination- the US- and landed in New York to begin their very long journey across the globe. 'I can remember the first day, we were in Times Square with all our camera gear and  we didn't get up the courage to ask a single person to be involved,' Carl said. 'It was a bit rainy, and when it stopped raining we told ourselves it was too dark, and then it was, 'oh, we haven't eaten', so we kept finding an out,' he said. The couple began their filming journey in New York and visited 70 cities in their year of filming . Both Epiphany and Carl have a background in film: Carl worked as a senior editor at an advertising agency and Epiphany worked at a production company before going freelance . The pair, from Sydney, set themselves a goal of releasing one mini documentary each day for a year . 'But we realised that we just have to get out there and do it, and then next day we went back out again and found a busker. As soon as we put ourselves out there we found that people were so willing to get involved.' Over the course of the year, Epiphany and Carl visited 70 cities in 35 countries to capture moments and people on camera- and on a strict production schedule and budget, found themselves stretched to the limits. 'We ended up starting out with three months of funding, and managed to stretch it out to six months by living very cheaply,' Epiphany said. 'There were a few times when we actually did run out of money, but we managed to build enough of a following that we were able to get sponsorship from tourism boards to stay in their city, as well as hotels and hostels,' she said. 'But even then $40 between the two of us wasn't much. Sometimes it came to dinner and we would have a can of pineapple, a packet of chips, and some chocolate left, and that would be what we ate.' Moniek travels the world playing her violin, and met Epiphany and Carl when she was playing at the New Orleans French Quarter Festival . Alisha and seven of her friends moved to California from Minnesota. She works for Pin Up Girl Clothing and is passionate about women being comfortable with their bodies . As well as their tight budget, the pair set themselves a goal of releasing one mini documentary each day, a plan they managed to stick to despite a few setbacks. 'We left three weeks before we planned on releasing our first one, so we thought we'd always be three weeks ahead of schedule, but things always go wrong when you're travelling,' Carl said. 'But we always managed to get them out. There were a couple of funny moments where we would be madly dashing around trying to upload a film,' he said. 'There was this one moment where we were in New Orleans and the film was in the middle of uploading on the free wifi of a cafe, and they kicked us out because they were closing. We had to run down the street as it was raining with the laptop open underneath a poncho trying to find another cafe with internet.' The couple said that the stress and pressure was worth it to experience so much of the world and to meet so many people who were willing to share their stories. 'We learnt millions of lessons, and every week there was at least one life lesson. Overall the biggest thing for me was that we are all human and we share the same basic needs and wants,' Epiphany said. Galen the dog is eight years old and has a talent for 'playing dead'. His owner Nolan uses his ability to busk in the streets . Titus  Mario are ambulance drivers, or 'EMT's', who work 13-hour days in New Orleans . Justin, Devon and Bailey (left to right) are homeless and have banded together as a 'family' of their own making, decided to live on the streets after being kicked out of the Scientologist church . The pair said they learnt to not just observe but also engage with people's lives, to be vulnerable themselves if they were asking the same of others. 'There was this one guy in Ireland we interviewed, he was with a group in a park who were doing this improvisational dance where they connected by touching each other,' Epiphany said. 'We did a documentary on one of the guys and I ended up giving the dancing a go because you can't just ask others to be vulnerable, you have to be willing to do it yourself,' she said. 'If they feel you're nervous they'll be nervous, but as soon as you let down your guard people open right up and are willing to give so much,' Carl said. In Botswana, Epiphany and Carl arrived to be told that the night beforehand a tourist had been eaten by a lion, and interviewed their local tour guide who spent the whole night sitting outside camp shooting his gun into the air to keep the predators away. 'The next morning we found fresh lion prints 100 metres away,' Epiphany said. The couple also met the woman who has the most piercings on her body in the world, and had the chance to stay with locals in Cambodia and Slovenia, which they describe as 'very tortured places'. This couple from Iceland were born four hours apart on the same day and went to school together before they started dating . Unur (above) is a tour guide for the Golden Circle of Iceland with Icelandic Excursions . Elaine has 9,800 piercings on her body and is a Guinness World Record holder. She told Epiphany and Carl that she moved to Scotland because she 'likes the men in the kilts' After a year away, Epiphany and Carl headed home from their last stop in Singapore, and touched down in Sydney in an emotional last leg to their journey. 'As we were flying in over Sydney it was cloudy and then all of a sudden you could see the Harbour Bridge. Epiphany burst into tears immediately,' Carl said. 'It was very surreal to come home and see all our family at the airport after so long, it was hard to take in,' he said. After one night celebrating their homecoming with family and friends, the couple got back to business, finishing off their last seven 'docobites' in their hometown. 'The second day home we got right back into it, and kept going until we reached our last one, which was a doco on us,' Carl said. The last docobite came out on Tuesday, giving the couple time to breathe for the first time in a year. 'The project isn't over though. We want other people to contribute their videos, and start watching the ones we already have up,' Epiphany said. Glyn (above) is an IT specialist who spends his weekends playing his bagpipes to the masses . 'This is not the end of the project, it's actually just the beginning of what we want to achieve. It's exciting that it's going beyond us and inviting people into the experience of storytelling,' she said. After a year on the road interviewing a cross section of the world, Epiphany and Carl said their experience taught them so much about how to relate to other people. 'Once we realised that we are all essentially the same in so many ways, the world became a much friendlier place. Looking at the ways we are the same rather than the ways that we are different means there are so many ways of problem solving and helping one another,' Epiphany said.

Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is ‘shameful’ to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. ‘People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.’ Ending screening at 73 ‘doesn’t take account of the fact that ageing is changing’, adds Nat Lievesley. ‘It’s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.’ Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

But seemingly unsatisfied with his gaggle of offspring, scorned former lovers and being engaged for the fourth time, the 56-year-old is showing no signs of settling down soon. For despite being set to marry, the alcoholic benefits claimant still has a live profile on the site where he met his bride-to-be. Despite being engaged for the fourth time and having already fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin still has an active online dating profile . Offering a half-grin to the camera with his signature pony-tail tucked away from view, Holpin tells prospective conquests: 'I love my kids,' in a brief biography on his Plenty of Fish account. Listed among his hobbies is watching TV and playing computer games - a luxury indulged by the taxpayer who footed the bill for his three 48in widescreen television sets, as revealed earlier this week. But while Holpin paints himself as a doting father, one of his many children has spoken out to confirm the feeling is not mutual. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, two of his sons have revealed they wish they'd never even come into contact with him. Fearful that any girl he meets during a night out may be his sister, care worker Mike Holpin Junior, 22, said dramatically: 'I wish I'd never met my dad. I'd rather be related to Hitler than to him.' Younger brother Luke, 21, said so bad was his father's womanising, his mother once tried to stab him with a butter knife after being duped out of money to buy new motorbikes. 'As soon as the money dried up he moved on. It devastated her. 'She caught him snogging another woman in the garden and tried to stab him with a butter knife.' 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, is said to have cost taxpayers £4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family . Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . The brothers also claimed their father spent the majority of his benefits payouts on alcohol and new bikes. Earlier this week it was revealed Holpin had cost the taxpayer an estimated £4million in benefits and care costs by fathering so many children. At least 16 have been taken off him and their mothers and placed into care. CARE COSTS: Mike Holpin says 16 of his children were taken into care. A placement in local authority care costs an average of £150,000 a year. If they each spent just a year in care, the bill would be £2.4million. CHILD BENEFIT: £1,000 per annum for the eldest child, plus £700 per year for each additional child, which would be claimed by the person looking after the child. Assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit, the bill would be at least £500,000. Child tax credits would have been worth an average of £2,000 per year, per child if the parents were not working. That’s £800,000. HIS BENEFITS: Mr Holpin claims he has received up to £27,000 a year in benefits, totalling £675,000. TOTAL BILL: £4,375,000 . Despite not being able to recognise all of his children in the street, Holpin is in no rush to stop reproducing. Leaping to his defence, fiancee Diane Morris, 46, told The Sun: 'He's a good guy. He's been unfaithful but that's all in the past'. One of his youngest children, a three-year-old girl, was born after he agreed to help a childless couple have a baby. He said: 'I helped them by having sex with her. For all my sins I have done one or two things right'. One of his children, Hayley, 25, who is also unemployed, said: 'He was a p***head but he's done well. I'm proud,' she told The Sun. But Mr Holpin’s brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker’s ‘shocking’ behaviour had brought ‘shame’ on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: ‘I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago – he didn’t have a phone so we couldn’t keep in touch. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. 'I’m not ashamed of Michael, but I’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished. ‘He has brought shame on us, and we are a good family.’ His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. Addicted: Holpin plays on his three £450 PS4 consoles for up to 20 hours a day - all paid for by benefits . Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: ‘I’ll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I’m doing what God wants. 'I’m as fertile as sin. I don’t believe in contraception and I love sex'. He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: ‘Feeling Asshamed’ (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. ‘Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they’ve suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I’m an alcoholic. I’m still an alcoholic – I just don’t practise it.’ TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.’ But former friends say Mr Holpin’s boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had ‘padded’ his numbers by including his ex-partner’s stepchildren. He added: ‘He’s no angel after a drink but he isn’t the big ladies’ man that he likes to think he is. 'He’s definitely had a football team’s worth of little ’uns – maybe 16 – just because he’s not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.’ Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin’s daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: ‘You can all hate but it doesn’t matter, there’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. ‘I feel like I can’t even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn’t ask my dad to do what he’s done with his life.’ Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Day out: Mike and Diane with some of the children at their local bowling alley . New life: The father-of-40 lives with his fiancée Diane Morris, ten years his junior, and they live in a two-bed council house in South Wales ."}

I was called ugly, vile, ‘someone who deserves to die’, and one wit even ‘hoped I would catch malaria’. In all, I’ve probably received more than 600 insults, and two days later they’re still coming. Luckily, I’ve got a thick skin, but whatever happened to free speech? In the knockabout atmosphere of an election campaign, everything is up for debate. Scroll down for video . Janet Street-Porter posted this picture on Twitter with the caption ‘Just met Nicola Sturgeon lookalike out canvassing!’ Both the Press and the public routinely talk about politicians in less-than-flattering terms, mocking their trendy (or spartan) kitchens, their silly casual clothes and their strange hairstyles, not to mention their attempts to eat a bacon sandwich, hug babies, cook a casual lunch or chuck a bowling ball — all in the name of a photo opportunity. The UK is home to a rich and raucous tradition of political satire, from 19th century caricaturists such as George Cruikshank and James Gillray, to more recent cartoonists Gerald Scarfe, Ralph Steadman and those in Private Eye magazine, as well as TV series such as Spitting Image, Mock The Week and Have I Got News For You. Most of our most successful comedians sneer at the party leaders. So you might imagine that the Scots could cope with a few harmless jibes about their own First Minister. Wrong, wrong, wrong. All the pollsters agree that the SNP is destined to win the vast majority of the seats (up to 50) North of the Border in the General Election, crushing the Tories and trouncing Labour. They already control the majority of votes in the Scottish Assembly. Could this surge of nationalism mean that Scotland is in danger of becoming another North Korea, a land where the ‘dear leader’ is sacrosanct, a figure on a pedestal, to be worshipped and admired — but never criticised? At the weekend, one commentator announced that ‘Scotland has fallen in love with Nicola — she is adored’. Indeed last night Ms Sturgeon was as feisty as ever in the leaders’ debate. My goodness, you certainly couldn’t say that about any party leader South of the Border, or in Wales. Despite all the photo calls at factories, in schools and cafes and villages halls, poll after poll shows that the public find most British politicians ‘out of touch’. Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have ‘minus’ personal ratings, while even Ukip’s Nigel Farage, once the poster boy for the disaffected, could be in danger of losing his bid to become an MP in South Thanet. Janet Street-Porter said she had no idea of the outrage her 'light-hearted comment' would provoke from Nicola Sturgeon's (pictured) supporters . So how has Nicola Sturgeon become Teflon Woman, a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means (according to her fans) I can no longer be considered a feminist? According to her followers, I am a traitor to my sex, a woman less attractive than Red Rum, a sub-human who should be neutered. It’s all beginning to sound like a repressive communist state. Sadly, some SNP supporters combine commendable patriotism with a deep-seated distrust of the English — not just the posh people from down here, but anyone born in the ‘wrong’ country. I first encountered this when I made an hour-long documentary for BBC Scotland last year, looking at voting intentions in the independence referendum. I love Scotland and have spent many happy weeks walking, working and fishing there, so making this film was a real pleasure. I talked to people of all persuasions in the Borders, the Central Belt between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in the North-East. We went to inordinate lengths to present a scrupulously balanced film — but when it was transmitted, because I was born in England (and am actually half-Welsh) I was attacked in the Scottish Press, on Twitter and other social media for having the audacity to host a programme about ‘their’ country. Utter madness. Some SNP members are so consumed with themselves that all they want is people to agree with them, and sod everyone else. They are blinkered zealots incapable of reasoned debate. During their aggressive campaign for independence — which got the knockback by a sizeable margin, with 55 pc in favour of remaining in the UK — the Nationalists earned a reputation for ruthlessly attacking anyone who didn’t agree with them. The author J.K. Rowling was denounced as unpatriotic for daring to speak out in favour of Scotland remaining part of the UK. Dubbed the Tartan Taliban and the Cyber Nats, fanatical SNP followers use social media to ‘troll’ opponents, and anyone daring to criticise their leader. When the BBC political editor Nick Robinson reported from Scotland on the referendum last year, the Nationalists took such offence to what they regarded as his biased broadcasts that hundreds of marchers took to the streets carrying a huge banner with the words ‘Sack Nick “The Liar” Robinson, a totally corrupt journalist'. But they don’t stop at professional attacks. When Robinson announced a few weeks ago that he had a cancerous tumour on his lung, the Cyber Nats went straight on Twitter with comments such as ‘a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased Beeb man good’. In similar vein, after a Daily Mail writer published a profile of Nicola Sturgeon in these pages recently, he was attacked relentlessly online, and called a Nazi, racist scum, a vile bigot, a misogynist, and told to f*** off back to England. Many of those abusing him had a blue Nationalist ‘45’ logo on their Twitter feed, to represent the percentage who voted for independence last year. So what of the woman these people idolise as some great political saviour unlike any other figure in Britain today? Janet Street-Porter (right) asks how Nicola Sturgeon (left) has become 'a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means (according to her fans) I can no longer be considered a feminist?' Consider the facts: Ms Sturgeon, just like Ed Miliband, has spent her whole life (apart from a brief period working as a solicitor) entirely engrossed in politics. Her husband and her former boyfriends and most of her friends all work for the SNP. Yet it is Ed Miliband, not Sturgeon, who gets derided for being ‘weird’ and having not experienced the real world. From 1992 onwards, she unsuccessfully stood for seat after seat in local and national elections, before eventually gaining a place in the Scottish Parliament via a quota system in 1999. She had a total image make-over in 2004 — hiring a stylist, changing her Krankies-style hairdo, losing weight and softening her approach. But make no mistake, she is as ruthless an operator as any other party leader. Her stated goal is Scottish independence, no matter what effect that might have on the rest of the UK, even though her party lost what was supposed to be a ‘once-in-a-generation’ vote on this issue last year. When questioned on television this week, she refused to rule out a second referendum in the very near future. When it comes to dealing with the deficit and setting out an economic strategy, Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have had their plans ruthlessly dissected. Sturgeon, however, based her sums on an oil boom that has failed to materialise, which has deprived the Scottish economy of billions of pounds of expected revenue. She wants Scotland to be responsible for raising its own taxes, but when an independent think-tank, the Institute For Fiscal Studies, looked at her plans for tax and spending and said they would result in a whopping £7.6 billion deficit, she described their findings as ‘irrelevant’. Yes, I admire Nicola Sturgeon’s tenacity, and I applaud any woman who rises to the top in her chosen profession. I know from experience just how tough that can be. Nevertheless, we find ourselves in the unenviable position of facing an election where a party that 60 million Britons cannot vote for — the SNP — could hold the balance of power at Westminster. It is a self-proclaimed ‘progressive’ party which hypocritically accepted £2.5 million of donations from Brian Souter, the Stagecoach boss who doesn’t believe in equal rights for gays. Does that make her any different to Ed Miliband, with his much-criticised relationships with the trade unions, or David Cameron with his cronies in Big Business? Voters in England can do nothing to stop the Sturgeon bandwagon gaining momentum — SNP membership has tripled in the past year, and it’s now the third-largest political party in the UK. But worrying questions remain about some of her followers. By trying to stifle debate and silence any jokes (no matter how feeble) about their leader, they are beginning to look more like fanatics than political supporters."}

Obama sat on one side, between the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook pioneer Mark Zuckerberg, but the place of honor was no accident. Google executives and employees donated more than $1.6 million to Obama's two White House campaigns, and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both. One result has been a coziness with the U.S. government's executive branch that few other companies can match – marked by access for lobbyists, mentions in nearly half of Obama's State of the Union addresses, and a personnel feeder trough serving the White House with new senior hires. BEGINNING: In 2007 Barack Obama had an on-stage cameo with Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt as part of a presidential candidate series . INFLUENCE: Schmidt (far left) shared the head of the table with the spouse of a venture capitalist whose firm owned 20 per cent of Google, as President Obama dined with tech leaders in 2011 . There have even been allegations that Google's up-close-and-personal relationship with the West Wing earned it a reprieve from what would have been an earth-shaking Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit. Google has insisted it never received special treatment in that case, punctuating its denials with an animated GIF of a laughing baby as a jab at the news outlet that leveled the charge. White House visitor logs suggest a different kind of story for the company whose motto is 'Don't be evil.' Employees of the Silicon Valley behemoth have been in the White House more than 230 times since Obama took office – approximately once per week. At least 190 of those meetings were with senior officials. More than 60 featured Google lobbyist Johanna Shelton. Overall, according to The Wall Street Journal, Google spent $16.8 million on lobbying last year. That's four times the amount spent by Apple, whose market capitalization is twice as big. It needed that muscle in 2011, after the FTC found Google allegedly manipulated search results in ways that favored its own for-profit products. Amazon and eBay were among the companies who complained that Google was engaging in practices that violated antitrust laws. The Journal reviewed emails showing that Google co-founder Larry Page met directly with FTC officials in late 2012 to discuss a settlement. About the same time, White House visitor logs show, Google chairman Eric Schmidt met with Obama senior adviser Pete Rouse. REVOLVING DOOR? Google vice president Megan Smith left her job to become Obama's chief technology officer . Lobbyist Joanna Shelton and General Counsel Kent Walker met with Jason Furman, then the newly minted chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Furman followed up with a meeting with FTC chairman Jon Leibowitz. The government closed its investigation two months after Obama won re-election. READY FOR HILLARY: Stephanie Hannon, director of product management, civic innovation and social impact at Google, has become the Hillary Clinton campaign's top technology guru . Google agreed to change its business practices but dodged a potential 10-figure fine – and saved the cost of litigating a years-long case that could have resulted in breaking up the company into smaller, more market-competitive units. Both Google and the FTC said at the time that there was no undue influence. Google pilloried the Journal, which first suggested a link between the company's access and the investigation's outcome, saying the meetings its executives held with administration officials involved discussions about 'everything but' the antitrust investigation. In a blog post, the company cited 'patent reform, STEM education, self-driving cars, mental health, advertising, Internet censorship, smart contact lenses, civic innovation, R&D, cloud computing, trade and investment, cyber security, energy efficiency and our workplace benefit policies.' The written defense Google published took specific aim at Journal publisher Rupert Murdoch, and included an animated GIF of a laughing baby in a high chair. But a Google spokesperson confirmed Thursday on background that company executives has talked with the FTC about unspecified antitrust concerns in the past. The spokesperson declined to be quoted or named. Schmidt is a one-man case study of the kinds of influence a multibillionare tech titan can wield in Washington when the stars align. LEFT-HAND MAN: Schmidt (right) got a prime seat at the table when newly minted President Obama met with a group of CEOs in February 2009 . 'EVANGELIST': Online pioneer Vint Cerf is Google's top 'Internet evangelist' and also a member of Obama's National Science Board . His ascent in Obama's world began in 2007 when the future president visited Google's California headquarters for a one-on-one interview, staged for the benefit of the company's employees, then 16,000 strong. Schmidt asked him about Iran, Pakistan, and Guantanamo Bay. 'Close down Guantanamo,' Obama replied, 'restore Habeas Corpus, say no to Renditions, no to warrantless wiretaps.' The exposure was vital: Obama ended up lapping the field in fundraising in the high-tech sector. Obama offered Schmidt his choice of cabinet slots after the 2012 election – either Treasury or Commerce – and was even prepared to create a new 'Secretary of Business' position for him. He declined all three but accepted a post on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. He continues to evangelize about both his company and the president's agenda, including 'net neutrality' regulations that have big Internet service providers up in arms. Schmidt's roots with Obama run deep. When the future president visited his campaign headquarters on Election Day in 2012, Schmidt was there overseeing final efforts to leverage 'Big Data' to nudge last-minute voters to the polls. He was by then already a donor to Obama's White House bids, contributing the maximum amount allowed by law both times. Schmidt's specialized software gave then-Senator Obama access to high-tech voter targeting algorithms that Republican John McCain couldn't match. HIGH LIFE: Google Ideas director Jared Cohen co-wrote a book with Princess Beatrice of York in 2013, three years after he left the Obama State Department to work for the search giant . ELECTION KINGS: Michael Slaby (left) and Justin Vincent (right) were key architects of Obama's data-mining and voter-targeting software efforts, and both were emigres from Google . And Michael Slaby, the chief integration and innovation officer af Obama For America, the president's campaign organization came over from a job as technology strategist for TomorrowVentures – Schmidt's venture capital fund. OFA also boasted former Google software engineer Justin Vincent as its senior codewriter, and former YouTube/Google lead Web developer Angus Durocher as its lead online software engineer. Google itself was accused publicly of favoring Obama's 2012 re-election campaign in a more visible way. Customized search results would appear when users typed 'Obama' into a search window, but entering 'Romney' yielded no such help. Google claimed at the time that it was the result of a computer algorithm, not human intervention. This week the president's new initiative linking global warming with public health includes a specific buy-in from Google. The company, the White House says, will 'donate ten million hours of high-performance computing' and help scientists to create 'early warning capabilities' for climate change-related disasters and related risks for diseases. Some of that work could conceivably be performed by former White House staff who have joined Google, just as the president counts several former Google executives among his advisers. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton this week hired away a top tech talent from Google for her presidential campaign-in-waiting. Stephanie Hannon, formerly Google's top dog on product management for 'civic engagement,' will help her navigate the digital waters in 2016. Poaching seasoned Google veterans is a maneuver the Obama White House has perfected. Megan Smith, a former vice president at the company, is now the administration's chief technology officer. Angus Durocher, a computer engineer who left Google to work for the Obama campaign, tweeted this photo of himself and Vice President Joe Biden when he was at work in the campaign's New Hampshire nerve center . The deputy CTO position was held for Obama's first two years by another Google emigre, Andrew McLaughlin. He left the administration in 2011 after a reprimand for sharing details of government policy matters with his former coworkers via a personal email address. Shortly after Obama moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, former Google project manager Katie Stanton became his director of citizen participation. Sonal Shah, a former Google global development chief, moved to Washington the same month to lead the White House Office of Social Innovation. And Vint Cerf, a widely acknowledged 'father of the Internet,' serves on Obama's National Science Board. Cerf has worked for Google since 2005 as a vice president and its 'chief Internet evangelist.'"}

Anthropologists studying the remains of a prehistoric woman nicknamed The Red Lady of El Mirón have found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth. Discovered in an elaborate grave in the El Mirón cave in Cantabria, Spain, the remains are thought to belong to a 35 to 40-year-old woman who was buried around 18,700 years ago. The images above show some of the microscopic fungal spores from grilled fungi (left) and bolete fungi (right) that the researchers found trapped inside the hardened dental plaque on the Red Lady of El Mirón's teeth . The study now provides the oldest evidence yet that mushrooms were eaten by early humans and helps to shed new light on the mysterious Red Lady. Her body was found in 2010 in the cave stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers with an engraved stone nearby. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. Her robust skeleton, which bore few signs of disease, and her elaborate funeral suggests she may have been of high status or even buried in a sacrificial ritual. Now the research looking at the dental calculus - hardened plaque - has helped to shed some light on her diet. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found her teeth bore the remains of plant pollen, fungi and animals. They found microscopic evidence that the woman had been eating sponge capped, bolete mushrooms and gilled mushrooms from the Agaric group. The researchers also found her teeth bore little signs of decay, suggesting she ate few carbohydrates. Robert Power, who led the research, said: 'These types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants from different environments, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'This finding at El Mirón Cave could be the earliest indication of human mushroom use or consumption, which until this point has been unidentified in the Palaeolithic.' Agaric muchrooms include the distinctive red and white spotted fly agaric, which is poisonous but also has halucinogenic qualities. However, the group includes many common forms of mushroom that are harmless. Bolete mushrooms include Boletus edulis, which is also called porchini. There is some evidence from neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Piedmont in the Italian Alps that suggest psychotropic mushrooms were used in rituals. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of El Mirón Cave, which lies between Santander and Bilbao. This plant fragment was discovered in the hardened plaque on the teeth of the Red Lady of El Mirón . The Red Lady was discovered in the El Mirón Cave in 2000 at a site that has been excavated since 1996 . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings but the Red Lady was found covered in the substance when her remains were discovered . After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal which as has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. The entrance to the El Mirón Cave (above) is located in the mountainous region of eastern Cantabria in Spain . The Red Lady was found in an elaborate grave (pictured) and is thought to have been buried 18,700 years ago . Anthropologists who have studied the Red Lady's remains believe she was buried in a tightly bundled fetal position on her left side with her chest facing the cave wall and her back towards a large stone block . The fact she was buried within in what appears to be living quarters has suggested she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. A primative tombstone found nearby also hints at this. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. There is some evidence that the people living in the cave at the time ate large amounts of meat from red deer and ibex but there are few signs of what role plants played in their diet. Mr Power and Dr Amanda Henry, whose work is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined samples of the plaque from the Red Lady's teeth in an attempt to learn more about her. They found chemical signitures that indicate she may have eaten seeds, roots and other plants with low levels of starch. The Fly agaric (above) is one of the most easily recognised  gill mushrooms which formed the Red Lady's diet . The researchers also found the remains of pollen from pine trees and spores from the fungi. It is possible the fungi had been used to help flavour food or as a medicine. The Tryolean Iceman 'Otzi' - who lived around 3,000 years ago - was found to be carrying several types of fungi. Writing in the journal, Mr Power and his colleagues said their findings had shed new light on prehistoric diet of the Red Lady. They said: 'The types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants, including seeds and underground storage organs, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'These findings suggest that plant and plant-like foods were parts of her diet, supplementing staples derived from animal foods.' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria."}

YES!’ in a pitch-black car park in London’s Docklands. It’s been raining and the ground is damp, but we are all in our bare feet, which are going numb on the cold, hard concrete. Undeterred, we keep going. There’s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat. Marianne Power attended Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminarwhich claims to ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want' The mood is tribal. I feel as if we’re on our way to a ritual killing. Maybe our own. We’ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in ‘physical or emotional injury, paralysis, death . . .’ and we’ve spent the past half-an-hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation. I feel sick with anticipation, but there’s no way out — the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward. Then, the chanting stops and a hush fills the air. We are faced with our fate. It glimmers grey and red in the darkness: lanes of burning hot coals, which we are to walk over. Yes, actually walk over — with our bare feet. We have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment — being whipped into something called ‘peak state’, a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything. The idea is that, once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 Fahrenheit, you can ‘conquer the other fires of your life with ease’. But I don’t conquer anything with ease. It’s not in my nature. ‘Am I really doing this?’ is all I can think. But yes, I am. For the past year, I’ve been on a self-improvement mission. Fed up with a life spent worrying, single and broke, I’ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month. Marianne (pictured) has set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month and this month she chose that of Anthony Robbins . And, when it comes to the self-improvement world, Anthony Robbins is the king. Everyone from world leaders — Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev — to athletes such as Serena Williams and actors including Hugh Jackman seek his counsel. He even helped Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. His IS a classic rags-to-riches story. Determined to transcend his poor childhood, he became obsessed with self-improvement. He’d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor, before going on to give motivational talks himself. Fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man, whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars. He charges $1 million to coach private clients — which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall. Anthony Robbins (pictured in the 1990s) charges $1 million to coach private clients and is the 'king' of the self-improvement world . According to his website, Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminar would help me ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want, break through any barriers that might be holding you back, increase your energy and mental clarity, and infuse passion into your life’. Big promises. But the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver. She has been three times before, she tells me. ‘When you walk over those coals, something changes,’ she says, her eyes wide. ‘I can’t explain it, but it’s just amazing.’ She has all the fervour of a fanatic. Two physiotherapists from Windsor join in our conversation — they’ve been sent here by their boss. ‘He went last year and got a lot out of it,’ they say. ‘He was on a high for weeks.’ And ‘high’ is the perfect word for the atmosphere. As we file into the arena, there’s chaos as people rush to get good seats — but no one sits in them. They’re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers. It’s like being at a One Direction concert. After half-an-hour, Tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale. People can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man. With his Hollywood tan, white teeth and lantern jaw, he looks like something that a Mills & Boon writer would dream up. And just to add to the effect, his chiselled face is blown up to God-like proportions on massive screens behind him. It takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak — but when he starts, he doesn’t stop. His basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state. He says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then ‘the impossible just gets done’. He is the King of the Catchphrase: ‘It’s impossible to love yourself when you’re not being yourself’; ‘Change your story, change your life . . .’ These nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm. He doesn’t take a tea break and neither do we. It’s extraordinary — I’ve never seen anything like it. Just the sheer energy of him. I find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential, then I realise I’m swooning. Even world leaders like Nelson Mandela (left) and Bill Clinton (right) have sought the advice and counsel of Anthony Robbins . I turn to the Norwegian man next to me and say: ‘I think I’m in love . . .’ He smiles and says: ‘Me, too.’ We are all under his spell and will do anything he says, including hugging and high-fiving strangers, and punching our fists in the air while yelling: ‘Yes, yes, yes!’ It’s just so un-English. There are moments when I look around at the collective madness and feel as if I’ve become part of a cult, but I have to make a decision: get embarrassed or go with it. I go with it. As the day goes on, we examine our ‘limiting beliefs’. I identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick. And then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs. I imagine being healthy, energetic and productive, someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong. I imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property. To build on this vision, we’re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives, the moment we felt strongest and most at peace. I think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that I’m proud of. Each time we do we are told to ‘make a move’, so every time we make that move in the future, these memories will come back. I pump my fist in the air, again and again and again. I can’t believe I’m doing it — it’s so not me. I feel as if I’m in the film Rocky. And then the time comes to walk on fire. We’re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park. Robbins is said to have also helped well-known face including Princess Diana (left) and former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (right) A part of me wants to run away, but a bigger part of me knows that I can do this. Then I’m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout: ‘YES!’ I do. They say ‘Make your move!’ and I pump my fist in the air. Then, I go for it. I put my foot on the coals and after that I remember nothing — until my last step, when I could feel heat. I have half-a-second of panic when I realise what I’m doing — but, by then, my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers. It’s done. I’ve walked across a bed of hot coals. Two weeks later, I still cannot answer those questions, but I find myself having the same thoughts as the woman I met in the queue at the start of that day. That strange moment of collective hysteria, when we walked over hot coals, has changed something within me. If I can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet, what else can I do? I’m very keen to find out. To follow Marianne’s self-help journey, go to helpmeblog.net ."}

After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

Cruz implied during a conversation with Daily Mail Online on Saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he wouldn't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the drug. The position stands in contrast to the views of at least three of his GOP competitors, who last week said that while they believe in states' rights to self-determination, they'd lay the hammer down on Colorado and Washington for flouting federal law. Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted CruzCruz implied during a conversation with Daily Mail Online on Saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he wouldn't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the sticky icky . Cruz, pictured here on Sunday in Litchfiled, New Hampshire, at the Londonderry Fish and Game Club, is personally against the legalization of marijuana but said this weekend he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law . Asked Saturday during a New Hampshire campaign stop if he would direct his attorney general to enforce federal pot laws, Cruz said ‘yes’ before providing a lengthy answer that indicated he would not. He first said that ‘if the attorney general and the president disagree with federal drug law they should come to Congress’ because Republicans and Democrats can come together on the issue of drug reforms. ‘But it is lawless for the attorney general simply with a stroke of a pen to say we will not enforce these federal laws we disagree with.' He was referring at that time to Eric Holder's Justice Department's decision to look the other way when it comes to minor drug offenses across the country. He then said: ‘There is a different circumstance when you have states that a democratically adopted law that legalizes marijuana.' 'When that happens that's a change in the legal standard, and then you have to apply conflict of law standards,' Cruz, the former solicitor general of the state of Texas, said. 'In my view the question of legalizing marijuana should be a question for the states. Now personally I don't support legalization. If it came up for a vote in the state of Texas, I'd vote no. But I respect the genius of the framers of our Constitution,' he added. Cruz's stance on the issue presents a problem the politician who has said the 'most dangerous' aspect of President Barack Obama's tenure ‘has been lawlessness, the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the Constitution.’ Article Six, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, better known as the Supremacy Clause, clearly states that laws established by Congress are 'the supreme law of the land' and the Supreme Court has consistently ruled in favor of the federal government. A strict Constitutionalist who has made a career for himself by bashing Obama for straying from its principles, Cruz's promise to respect the founding document has been at the center of his campaign for presidency. During his gaggle with reporters on Saturday after his speech at the First in the Nation conference in Nashua, New Hampshire, Cruz levied the attack on Obama's lawlessness, then, a minute or two later, in response to another question, said he would not vote in favor of the president's attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch when her name comes up for consideration in the U.S. Senate. The reason for his 'no' vote, he said, is the support for the president’s lawlessness that she demonstrated at her confirmation hearing. The role of the attorney general he said, is 'to remain faithful to the rule of law and the Constitution and the American people’. Cruz was then asked if he’d make his own attorney general follow the rule of law when it comes to federal marijuana policy. JUST SAY NO: Cruz's position stands in contrast to three of his GOP competitors - Marco Rubio, left, Chris Christie, center, and Lindsey Graham, right - who said last week that while they believe in states' rights to self-determination, they'd lay the hammer down on Colorado and Washington for flouting federal law . Cruz shakes hands with Adam Prendible, 8, of Bedford, New Hampshire, at his Sunday stop. Cruz was in town for the First in the Nation forum, held Saturday in Nashua . Daily Mail Online followed up on the statement in an email to Cruz's presidential campaign and pointed out that the constitutional scholar  seemed to arguing that states’ rights should supersede federal law in this specific ‘circumstance’ -  marijuana policy - and that he'd legally get around the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by claiming that ‘conflict of law standards’ should apply. It further pointed out that the Obama administration's alleged violation of Article II of the Constitution, the section that pertains to the executive branch, is not dissimilar from Cruz's own intentions. Lawyers for the Justice Department have argued in court that the president was within his legal right to act on immigration. Daily Mail Online also pointed out that Cruz's competitors for the GOP nomination - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a likely 2016 candidate, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, an announced contender - were asked a similar question about weed on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt's show last week and they were clear in their answers. 'Marijuana is a gateway drug,' Christie said after Hewitt asked him if he'd crackdown on weed sales in Colorado and Washington . Citing an 'enormous addiction problem in this country,' Christie said, 'we need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement. 'Marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law. And the states should not be permitted to sell it and profit from it.' Asked for the same thing by Hewitt, Rubio said 'Yes, I think we need to enforce our federal laws.' Rubio, who is also a lawyer by trade, said he's a believer in states' rights, 'but they don’t have a right to write federal policy as well.' Stating for the record his own sentiments on weed, Rubio then said, 'I don’t believe we should be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants in this country for the primary reason that when you legalize something, what you’re sending a message to young people is it can’t be that bad, because if it was that bad, it wouldn’t be legal.' A CANDIDATE'S BEST FRIEND: Cruz posed for pictures with potential supporters and their pets. A former solicitor general of Texas, Cruz's stance on pot resents a problem the politician who has said the 'most dangerous' aspect of President Barack Obama's tenure ‘has been lawlessness, the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the Constitution' Accompanying Cruz on the trip was his wife Heidi. She's pictured here on Sunday at the Londonderry Fish and Game club . In a separate interview with Daily Mail Online, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is expected to join the race at the end of May, said he 'would not embrace legalizing marijuana.' Asked if he would crack down on states deploying their own standards for weed sales as president, Graham said, 'The federal law preempts the state law. We just can't just take the law and do what we can't.' In response to Daily Mail Online's email, a spokesperson for Cruz said in a statement: 'Just because federal case law allows the federal government to assert the Supremacy Clause to try to displace state law, does not mean that in every instance the federal government should do so.' The response indicated that Cruz, if president, would not force his attorney general's office to go after states that legalize pot because he doesn't think the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution should be applied in areas where voters have said they want to get high without repercussions. 'The Framers of our Constitution understood cooperative federalism--the overlapping spheres of authority between the federal and state governments--and federal law enforcement can and often should respect and incorporate state law,' the statement from Cruz's campaign continued. 'The voters of the states of Colorado and Washington have made the decision to legalize marijuana, and that is a change in law that alters the appropriate enforcement of federal law.' She also made clear that Cruz is of the opinion that the Department of Justice 'lacks the authority to simply refuse to enforce current federal law' in states that have not passed their own marijuana laws.

Earlier today, the 25-year-old athlete was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2013 shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. A jury panel in Fall River, Massachusetts, spent 36 hours spread over seven days deliberating Hernandez’s fate before returning a guilty verdict. Scroll down for video . More victims: Aaron Hernandez is accused of killing Daniel Abreu (left), 29, and Safirdo Furtado (right), 28, immigrants from Cape Verde, in July 2012 after a nightclub altercation over a spilled drink . Former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, pictured at his sentencing at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, Wednesday, is facing a second trial in a 2012 deadly drive-by shooting . Following the sentencing phase, which took place immediately after the conviction, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail. A first-degree murder conviction in Massachusetts automatically triggers an appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court. A date for the Hernandez appeal wasn't immediately set. But the former Patriots tight-end will back in front of a judge later this year, this time in Boston, to face murder charges in the killings of Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safirdo Furtado, 28. The jury that rendered the Lloyd verdict was not told about that case. On July 16, 2012, the two immigrants from Cape Verde were found murdered in their car at a stop light in South Boston following a drive-by shooting. A third man was wounded in the incident but survived. They had reportedly gotten into a fight with Hernandez and his crew over a spilled drink at a night club prior to their murders. In May 2014, Hernandez was indicted for both killings. He pleaded not guilty. According to prosecutors, de Abreu accidentally bumped into him at Cure Lounge, spilling Hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was 'trying' him, and surveillance video outside the club showed Hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down at around 2.30am. Later, Hernandez drove around until he saw the men get in a BMW, followed them and shot at them from a silver SUV at a stop light, prosecutors said. A third man in their car also was shot but survived. About six weeks after that shooting, Hernandez signed a five-year, $40million contract with the Patriots, and he went on to play for another season before Lloyd was killed. He was cut from the team soon after being arrested in Lloyd's killing in June 2013. The Boston case against Hernandez is considered to be stronger than the one that had just wrapped up in Fall River because prosecutors have the suspected murder weapon in the drive-by shooting and eyewitness accounts to rely upon, according to Fox Sports. Justice for Odin: The 25-year-old athlete (left) was found guilty Wednesday of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2013 shooting death semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd (right) Back behind bars: Following the sentencing phase, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail . Under lock and key: The 25-year-old will spend the rest of his days at a maximum-security prison . The trial had been scheduled to get under way May 28, but now it will be pushed back into the fall or early next year to give Hernandez’s defense team ample time to prepare. 'We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track,' Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said in the wake of Wednesday's verdict, reported CNN. In the Boston case, Hernandez faces two counts of first-degree murder; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder; one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Hernandez also faces civil lawsuits from the families of the men he is accused of killing. And he was sued by Alexander Bradley, a former friend who says Hernandez shot him in the face and left him for dead in an industrial park in Florida after arguing with him in February 2013. Bradley lost his eye in the shooting and subsequently testified against Hernandez at his murder trial but never brought criminal charges of his own against his friend. The high-paid athlete had his $5million in assets frozen pending the outcome of the drive-by shooting trial. In court Wednesday, Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder in Lloyd's killing and several lesser charges - mostly related to the weapon he used in the murder - a .40-caliber Glock pistol which has never been found. Hernandez was found guilty of carrying a firearm without a license, two counts of carrying a large capacity firearm, possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card and possession of ammunition without an identification card. The prosecution said the player and two friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz drove Lloyd to an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough mansion and shot him to death, execution-style. Hernandez's attorneys countered that Hernandez was a witness to, not a participant in, the killing. Wallace and Ortiz are to be tried separately on murder charges. The Patriots cut Hernandez hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, nine days after a teenage jogger found Lloyd's body. Tears of joy, tears of sorrow: Ursula Ward, mother of the victim, and Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, burst into tears after hearing the guilty verdict . Lost love: Shaneah Jenkins, girlfriend of Odin Lloyd, broke down when the jury convicted her boyfriend's killer . During four months of testimony, the jury heard from more than 130 witnesses who testified that Hernandez, a native of Bristol, Connecticut, was a regular user of marijuana and sometimes of the stimulant PCP, that he owned guns and at times acted paranoid and that he said he felt his friends did not appreciate the things he did for them. Defense lawyers closed their case by saying Hernandez had been present at the time of Lloyd's slaying, but had been a witness not a participant. 'He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed ... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew,' said defense attorney James Sultan. 'He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other. Prosecutors countered that Hernandez had plotted and controlled every detail of the slaying. 'He believed he could kill Odin Lloyd and nobody would ever believe that he was involved,' said Assistant District Attorney William McCauley. Hernandez was led out of his mansion in handcuffs on June 26, 2013 - nine days after Odin Lloyd was found shot execution-style in an industrial park a mile away. Lloyd, 27, was a semi professional football player for the Boston Bandits. He had also been dating Shaneah Jenkins - the sister of Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his child, Shayanna Jenkins. Separate surveillance videos show Hernandez outside Lloyd's home about an hour before the murder, and then walking into his own $1.3million mansion after shots were heard. It also emerged that the NFL star destroyed surveillance video at his home. When he handed over his cell phone, it had been smashed to pieces. Ursula Ward had tears streaming down her face during a press conference following the conviction and sentencing of her son's killer . All eyes on jury: Jurors in the high-profile murder trial addressed the media after convicting Hernandez of first-degree murder . Hernandez glanced to the side and pursed his lips after the 12-person jury pronounced the first-degree murder conviction this afternoon. His mother and fiancee sobbed in the gallery. Dressed in a sharp suit and tie, he sat down as the jury convicted him on two separate gun and ammunition charges. Lloyd's tearful mother, Ursula Ward, told the court that she felt her heart 'stop beating for a moment' when she laid her son to rest, but that she had managed to forgive his murderers. 'I miss my baby boy Odin so much but I know I'm going to see him someday again and that is giving me the strength to go on,' she said, choking back tears. Not surprisingly, prosecutors welcomed the guilty verdict. 'The jury found that he was just a man who committed a brutal murder. The fact that he was a professional athlete meant nothing in the end,' District Attorney Thomas Quinn said. The murder weapon was never discovered, but analysts said the evidence against Hernandez was overwhelming. Hernandez has the right to appeal the conviction."}

Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used . Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the 18-year-old men, from Hallam and Hampton Park, were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider, the 18-year-old who was shot dead after stabbing two officers outside a Melbourne police station on September 23. He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) The second teenager is still being interviewed by police who plan to charge him with a number of offences related to preparing for and planning terrorist acts and possessing prohibited items. A number of 'edged weapons' - including knives and swords - were seized at some of the properties searched. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews dubbed the plans 'simply evil' on Saturday morning, while insisting the individuals 'do not represent any faith, culture or religion'. 'It is alleged both men were undertaking preparations for a terrorist attack at an Anzac Day activity in Melbourne which included targeting police officers,' Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Neil Gaughan said on Saturday morning. Commissioner Patton later added that: 'some evidence that was collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have, leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired.' A total of five teenagers were arrested as part of the Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team operation named Operation Rising, which saw 200 officers' raid seven properties on Saturday morning. Three of the men were released by Victoria Police on Saturday evening. However, according to Australian Federal Police Acting Commissioner Michael Phelan, all five had been on the radar of counter-terrorism investigators. 'Particularly since late last month the investigation ramped up and it became very obvious to us that their plans were specific,' he told reporters in Sydney. 'We received information earlier this week that led us to undertake the resolution today,' Mr Patton said, adding that investigations had begun last month.

However he insisted the 'the individuals were acting by themselves and are not representative of any religious, cultural or national group'. Three of the teenagers are believed to have suffered minor injuries during the arrests and were taken for medical examination, with one man reported to have suffered a head injury. Searches will continue at several addresses throughout Saturday. Police said the investigations are ongoing. Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights. 'It woke me up, I heard a whole heap of screaming outside. It kept going for at least 20 minutes. It scared the crap out of me,' one neighbour told the Herald Sun. 'I was woken up through hearing the car doors everywhere and the police telling them to get down,' another said. Most of the residents said they were shocked by the news of the arrests, describing the teenagers as 'lovely guys', 'nice people' and 'the perfect neighbours'.

But the growing slew of celebrity gaming apps, from the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan (and soon, Katy Perry), promise to immerse you in it all, temporarily. Femail investigates what it's like to 'live' the life of a celebrity for a day. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is the app from the reality star, which uses her likeness and voice. Users have to build a celebrity empire similar to Kim's . The 34-year-old launched the highly lucrative app last June, and has an estimated 28 million downloads . Kim Kardashian's highly lucrative app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, developed by Glu Mobile, has already been downloaded an estimated 28 million times since it was launched last June. The quest-based adventure game requires users to create a character (customising a 'cute' look is compulsory), become friends with Kim Kardashian and then embark on social-climbing, empire-building adventures. The character of Kim, voiced by the reality star herself, is your best friend in the game . YOU'RE NOBODY UNTIL YOU MEET KIM . At the beginning of the game, your character works in retail, takes public transport everywhere, her apartment is essentially bare and can't even afford to adopt stray cats. That is, until you meet Kim Kardashian by chance (voiced by the reality star herself), and she slowly introduces you into the industry. The game puts an emphasis in being charming and friendly to almost everyone, and also taking every opportunity . TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY . At the beginning, your boss trusts you to lock up the clothes shop, and Kim Kardashian turns up begging you to help her. You are given no choice but to break into the shop, choose her an outfit and give it to her for free. Luckily she rewards you by inviting you to a impromptu photo shoot. This type of sporadic activity is rife throughout the game and actively encouraged. MONEY AND CHARM IS KEY . Obediently completing mini-quests will win you cash and K-stars (which you can collect by paying real money), but as is expected, to actually complete many of the tasks and buy new clothes, money is also required. Kustomise yourself: It's necessary to constantly change your outfit and appearance in order to fit in at all the industry events . IMAGE IS EVERYTHING . Within ten minutes of living Kim Kardashian's life, users have changed their outfits three times and checked their reflections twice. Seemingly, no one makes it big in Hollywood without constantly considering how their image can be improved. Vogue's Andre Leon Talley (pictured left) makes an appearance in the game. No doubt as a career booster . PEOPLE FIT INTO 3 CATEGORIES . Strangely, it seems Kim is your only friend in the game, and you'd be wrong if you think you're allowed to make new ones. Characters fit into solely three categories: potential love-interests, career-boosters, or an arch-nemesis. Your very own 'momager': Early on in the game, Kim sites that a necessity of making it in the game involves having your own 'momager' (mother/manager), just like real-life parent Kris Jenner (pictured right - in the game) (Pictured left to right) the cartoon recreations of Kourtney, Khloé, Kim and Kris Kardashian. They are characters you eventually meet later in the game . YOU'LL NEED A 'MOMAGER' One of the first things Kim Kardashian mentions to you is that you need a 'momager'. Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian's very own, makes an appearance later in the game. You eventually also meet Kim Kardashian's real life family, who have all lent their likeness and voice to the app. This includes Kris, Kourtney, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie (but no Rob). Opportunities for fame come in all shapes of sizes, including dating (and marrying) people for exposure . YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO . Although the game allows you to fly to Milan with Kendall, and hang out with Vogue's Andre Talley Leon eventually, you have to do many things that aren't entirely favourable. This includes: dating (and marrying) people you don't want to for exposure, 'charming' people with K-Stars (which is a currency in the game) and partaking in sketchy photo shoots. Fame Game: Lindsay Lohan also launched her own game, The Price of Fame . Uncanny: Lohan's game is a lot sillier and almost works to poke fun at celebrity culture . Lindsay Lohan's game is comparatively sillier, and works more as a tongue-in-cheek critique of celebrity culture. If living a day in the life of Lindsay Lohan can be derived purely from playing her game, it's a lot sillier and crass than Kim Kardashian's. Although in both games you're similarly working towards meteoric fame, in Lindsay Lohan's you play for fans. You begin the game with no identity and no fans. Fans are earned  by spending coins on items that will boost your star status. Players must try and collect as many fans as possible, by engaging in ridiculous or unfavourable activities . All the fans: Success in Lindsay's game is judged by how many fans you can generate and also how quickly you can . ANKLE BRACELETS WILL WIN YOU FANS . Oddly enough, ankle bracelets are one of the purchases that can be used to win fans at a faster rate. Here's where the silly element of Lindsay Lohan's app really rears its head. Lindsay Lohan's game offers less trend-led outfits as Kim Kardashian's and seems to criticise the vacuity of showbiz . LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING . Unlike Kim Kardashian's app, Lindsay Lohan's game instantly tells you at the beginning, while you're choosing your outfit: 'Don’t worry, nothing is permanent in show business.' Your character starts off completely naked, with just stars covering her private areas. The game almost seems to critique the humiliating, vacuous process of turning into a Hollywood star. Rather than placing an emphasis on outfits and make-up, it's more about the ridiculous things you can choose to do. To generate fans quicker, you can choose to invest in publicity stunts, which include releasing nude selfies, having an elevator fights and even faking your death . SKETCHY ACTIVITIES ARE THE NORM . Publicity investments can bring you an endless barrage of fame and increase your notoriety. Options include: leaking a nude selfie, releasing a ghostwritten rap album, having an elevator fight, buying bum implants (one cheek at a time no less), faking your death, and sleeping with a poet laureate. Other investments also include phony rap beefs and nip slips. Among the ridiculous activities that can bring you press and publicity, you can also choose to engage in embarrassing photo shoots (pictured) IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT . Again, the idea of using money to directly buy your fame and influence is a key idea. Coconut water and paparazzi repellent are amongst the ridiculous things you can purchase that will earn you fans. KATY PERRY: Unnamed app . To be released at the end of 2015, the pop star has teamed up with none other than the app developers of Kim Kardashian's lucrative app: Glu Mobile. The app is likely to work on the same premise as Kim's, whereby users attempt to become Hollywood celebrities. But specifics have not yet been announced. TOM HANKS: Hanx Writer, Free . Inspired by the actor's real-life fascination with type-writers, the app recreates the nostalgic experience of an actual type-writer (noise and imagery included), but with the easy functionality of an iPad. In September of last year, the app topped the iTunes charts. DAVID HASSELHOFF: Ask The Hoff, Free . In the style of a Magic 8 Ball, the actor's app allows befuddled users to ask him for advice. It generates hilarious Hoff-appropriate answers that will see you through any problem. SAMUEL L JACKSON: iSamJackson, £0.79 . The first thing to consider before downloading the actor's app, is the warning: 'Explicit'. It works as a soundboard, whereby the user can select famous lines and Jackson will deliver them with recordings of his world-famous sass(and profanity). MARIAH CAREY: Mariah Carey-oke, £2.99 . Exactly what is says on the tin, users can test their knowledge of the diva's lyrics and vocal abilities. It uses voice recognition software to tell how well you can hit Carey's high notes. SNOOP DOGG: Snoopify, Free . Wildly popular, the app transforms users into virtual 'gangsters' with the help of digital stickers.

A father allegedly abused by Lord Janner has called for the top legal official who decided against prosecuting him to step down. Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, concluded dementia made the 86-year-old unfit to plead. Last night, one of the nine victims who had been lined up to give evidence against the former Leicester West MP waived his right to anonymity to say the decision ‘beggars belief’ – and claimed it points to an establishment cover-up. Hamish Baillie, 47, said he was unable to trust adults after being molested by Lord Janner during a game of hide-and-seek in a park, when he was a 15-year-old resident of a children’s home. But he added that the failure to prosecute the peer for a fourth time – three inquiries were curtailed by police or the Crown Prosecution Service – was a ‘complete travesty’. The father-of-three said he turned to drugs as a result of the abuse, which left him ‘questioning myself and everyone around me’. He believes Lord Janner was ‘steered’ in his direction by the care home’s manager, Frank Beck – a friend who would later be convicted of a string of child sex offences. He added: ‘I don’t think anybody other than the victims and the police involved in the Operation Enamel inquiry understand how perverted a man Lord Janner is. 'He has blighted my life … How can they [the CPS] publicise the fact that there was enough evidence to charge, yet then say it is not in the public interest to pursue it?’ Mr Baillie, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, added: ‘No disrespect to the public, but what about the interest of the victims? ‘As far as I’m concerned, her [Mrs Saunders’s] actions are barely any less perverse than the abuse inflicted upon me as a teenager. She should initiate an inquiry into her own conduct and then step down because Alison Saunders certainly hasn’t been doing her job properly.’ Mr Baillie said the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner (left),  who he claims abused him when he was aged 15,  for the fourth time was a 'complete travesty'. Alison Saunders (right) said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones . He said the police involved in the inquiry were ‘blameless’ but added that ‘when one considers this is the fourth time Janner has been investigated, I honestly think there could be a cover-up at play’. Operation Enamel was set up two years ago and 25 victims accused the Labour peer. Most lived in Leicestershire children’s homes between 1969 and 1988. The CPS last week said the ‘core allegation’ was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children ‘to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences’ on them. The politician was first implicated during the 1991 trial of Beck, who ran The Beeches children’s home in Leicester. A victim told the court Janner regularly abused him. Beck was convicted of child abuse and rape charges. He died in jail in 1994. Following Beck’s conviction, Lord Janner, then an MP, stood up in the House of Commons to vehemently deny any abuse, and the CPS decided not to take further action. But Mr Baillie, who spent ten months at The Beeches – where he was twice groped by Beck – said he firmly believes the men were acting together to abuse children. He was placed in care aged 15 for ‘rebellious behaviour’ and said he met Lord Janner in 1983 while playing arcade games at Leicester Forest East service station. The peer called him by name, he said, even though ‘I didn’t know him’ and gave him some coins. Mr Baillie said over the next seven months Lord Janner came to the service station seven times, sometimes discussing a hotel where they could go for ‘steak and whisky’. It was amid a game of hide-and-seek in Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, organised by Beck later that year, that he claims he was abused by the peer. ‘I was just moving behind a gorse bush to hide when I saw Greville Janner walking towards me,’ he said. ‘He sat down beside me … Then he abused me. It was indecent touching but he wanted it to go further … It lasted no more than 30 minutes, but it felt like an eternity.’ Mr Baillie believes Beck ‘tipped Janner off about where to find me’. He did not report the abuse to police and only realised who Lord Janner was when he saw the MP’s picture in a newspaper five years later. He added: ‘The fact that Greville Janner has been able to stand up in Parliament and deny abusing children, then carry on with his gilded life is beyond comprehension.’ Legal chief facing growing calls to quit: Backlash against top prosecutor grows as she is accused of ignoring victims and claims of a establishment cover-up . The furious backlash against the UK’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare Lord Janner from the dock. The position of Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders looked increasingly fragile as she faced growing calls to stand down. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs accused her of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers over the case. And even her one of her predecessors said the horrific allegations should have been resolved in the ‘full public glare of a courtroom’ rather than her London office. Mrs Saunders fought back saying it is her job as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service to make ‘very difficult decisions’ which are not necessarily popular. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers overhead . But the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86-year-old Labour life Peer were made public. The decision not to charge Lord Janner last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because Mrs Saunders said experts agreed that the former Leicester West MP was in such poor health due to advanced Alzheimer’s Disease. But she also ruled that he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. The top QC blamed police and prosecutors and launched in independent review, but her comments stoked fears that Lord Janner is the beneficiary of a wholesale cover-up. Yesterday, calls were growing for a judicial review of her decision, something which Leicestershire Police has said it is already considering. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Cyril Smith, said the weight of criticism against Mrs Saunders suggested something has ‘clearly gone very badly wrong’. He said: ‘Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.’ Criticism of Mrs Saunders began with comments from the Home Secretary, who has already been lobbied by senior police chiefs, when she said is ‘very concerned’. Theresa May said: ‘I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sex abuse issue – I expect to see justice done.’ She was joined by former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald who said a ‘trial of the facts’ should have been considered. This would have enabled a jury to decide the facts without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed – offering a chance for victims to be heard. Lord Macdonald said: ‘It might have been wiser for the CPS to say ‘we’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’ Further questions also emerged about the true state of Lord Janner’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the House of Lords just a fortnight ago to extend his role. The politician, who has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years, took a formal leave of absence last October. When asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called, he responded in a personally signed letter received on April 9 asking to continue in office. Experts said victims may now be denied the opportunity to sue Lord Janner because none of the claims have been proven. Richard Kovalevsky QC said: ‘A finding that the acts took place may have consequences for the defendant, particularly one who has the benefit of an honour from the Queen.’ Mrs Saunders has also come under fire over other high-profile cases, including the first disastrous attempt for a conviction for female genital mutilation and the pursuit of journalists."}

The Clinton partisan spoke to Daily Mail Online on background, saying the former secretary of state will first put her name forward for the White House on Twitter, and then barnstorm the Hawkeye State in what the Associated Press calls a series of 'small' meetings with voters. Separately, an Iowa Republcian Party official said on-the-ground forces loyal to Hillary are rounding up Democrats via phone trees and emails in preparation of campaign appearances early in the coming week. A New Hampshire GOP political operative who works for a likely candidate who hasn't yet launched a campaign added that Clinton's efforts in the state are 'surprisingly slow, given her primary victory here in 2008.' Clinton will fly to New Hampshire after her Iowa swing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . READY FOR HILLARY? Clinton will announce her bid to become America's first female president this weekend . STARTING GUN: The former first lady faces no substantial competition – yet – for the Democratic nomination in 2016 . In a timely release just days before the start of her presidential campaign, Clinton reveals in a new epilogue to her book 'Hard Choices' why she decided to take the presidential leap. 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on. Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up. 'As Margaret Mead said, children keep our imaginations fresh and our hearts young, and they drive us to work for a better future. I've also returned again and again to this question of universality – how much we all have in common even if the circumstances of our lives may be different. 'As you've seen throughout this book, one of the defining themes of my time as Secretary of State was our increasing global interdependence. Despite all the division and discord in the world, which sometimes can seem overwhelming, the basic fact of the 21st century is that we're more connected than ever. 'If the United States continues to lead the world in the years ahead, as I believe it can and must, it will be because we have learned how to define the terms of our interdependence to promote more cooperation and shared prosperity and less conflict and inequality. 'As we've seen since the first edition of this book was published in June 2014, the negative side of interdependence remains potent – whether it was the spread of virulent new strands of extremism in the Middle East or old-style nationalism in Europe or a deadly epidemic in Africa. Our job is to build up the positive side. 'The United States and the other great democracies have to redouble our efforts to empower moderates and marginalize extremists everywhere, and to stand firmly and united in pursuit of a more just, free, and peaceful world. 'That's the world I want for Charlotte and for all our kids.' In the excerpt, released Friday to the Huffington Post, she describes how becoming a grandmother inspired her 'to see the world in new ways' and made her realize that 'there was so much more to do.' 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on,' she writes. 'Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.' The maneuver of re-upping public attention on her poorly selling memoir, though, highlights one of Clinton's key liabilities: likeability. Her campaign has a steep hill to climb if she is to escape the 1990s-era image of a controlling and often temperamental politician, or the 2000s sequel – a scheming conniver bent on winning power. The Republican National Committee had been mum about Hillary's impending announcement, but the party took its gloves off Friday morning with a scathing video ad highlighting her scandals. 'From the East Wing to the State Department, Hillary Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday in a statement. 'Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary's record proves that she cannot be trusted.' The Clinton campaign-in-waiting held a secret off-the-record dinner with a hand-picked group of journalists Thursday night in Washington, D.C., also according to the Huffington Post. The former first lady once faced no substantial competition for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but a few challengers have emerged lately – most notably former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who has also conducting private fundraisers meetings in New York City. Clinton also faces intense scrutiny over an email scandal involving a private home-brew server she maintained at her Chappaqua, New York home, a problem that will taint her claim to her party's top perch. Announcing a presidential campaign on social media has become ordinary this year, with Republicans Rand Paul and Ted Cruz preempting their own televised launches with Tweets and Facebook posts meant to appeal to young and low-attention-span voters. Clinton, too, will need to leverage the online space and will follow her tweets with email and video announcements. The Reuters news service predicted that the videos will go 'viral.' In her previous presidential run in 2008, Clinton lost to Barack Obama, in part because of the Obama campaign's intense use of digital and online strategies to draw attention to his candidacy and raise huge sums through small donations. By 2012 his team, led by veterans from Facebook and Google, were deploying sophisticated social media strategies. Clinton's 2016 campaign is expected to concentrate on making the 67-year-old former first lady relatable to ordinary Americans despite her age and longstanding connection to the Democratic Party's political machinery. After serving eight years as first lady, she won a U.S. Senate seat in New York and then spent four years jetting to foreign capitals as Obama's first-term secretary of state. Day-to-day contact with everyday Americans has been elusive and rare. SKELETONS: Clinton will face a new round of scrutiny over her time in the White House as first lady . TWEET TWEET: The 67-year-old Democrat will have to find ways to connect with the younger voters as she distances herself from past and present scandals . Kristina Schake (pictured) has been brought in to help transform Hillary Clinton's public image . But in a year when Republicans have a deep bench, Democrats have sat back and waited for Hillary to claim their brass ring. She remains the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination but has seen her poll numbers slip in recent days. On Thursday a Quinnipiac University poll revealed she has slipped against the leading 2016 Republican candidates in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. Pollsters cited damage from what has become known as 'email-gate.' In a bid to recast her image she has brought in Kristina Schake, the former White House aide responsible for transforming  Michelle Obama's public image into that of an all-American 'everywoman' who shops at retail outlets, does 'mom dancing' on TV and even has a Twitter account. Schake, 45, will attempt to turn the 67-year-old politician from an aggressive and secretive figure into a softer, more accessible one. Thursday's swing state poll also showed Clinton in a close race with U.S. Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who declared his candidacy on Tuesday. Clinton is in tight hypothetical races in Colorado and Iowa, where she previously led by commanding margins. STAND WITH RAND: The Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll showed Hillary Clinton in a close race with U.S. Senator Rand Paul (pictured), the Kentucky Republican who declared his candidacy on Tuesday . 'It isn't just one or two Republicans who are stepping up;it's virtually the entire GOP field that is running better against her' since the last swing state survey on February 18, pollster Peter Brown said in a statement. Brown attributed the drop to the controversy that erupted in March over Clinton's use of personal email for work when she was America's top diplomat. Republicans have raised the prospect of congressional hearings on the issue. Paul led Clinton by 44 per cent to 41 per cent in Colorado and 43 per cent to 42 per cent in Iowa, the Quinnipiac poll showed. In Virginia, Clinton led 47 per cent to 43 per cent. 'These numbers are a boost for U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky as he formally launches his campaign,' Brown said. Most earlier polls had shown Clinton with a substantial lead over the Republican field."}

Despite making 30 arrests overnight, police are struggling to subdue the machete-wielding gangs who ransacked immigrant-owned shops in the slums of Johannesburg. Many families in the city who now fear for their lives have abandoned their homes and fled to a makeshift refugee camp which lies just east of Johannesburg.

Justification: But South African President Zuma has said 'no amount of frustration and anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals' There was a heavy police presence in the Alexandra township as armed rioters looted shops, burned tires and built street barricades overnight. And armed policeman fired rubber bullets at the groups who have torched shops and cars in the poor areas of Johannesburg in recent days. Police claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other African countries - have largely subsided in the country's east where the violence began. With unemployment and poverty levels high in the country, some South Africans have accused the immigrants of taking jobs and opportunities away from them. A police spokesman said the 30 people arrested in Johannesburg overnight will be charged for 'public violence, malicious damage to property, house breaking and theft'. Thousands of foreigners in the country have fled their homes and the country amid the violence, escaping to makeshift camps as well as neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique. The surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by King Goodwill Zwelithini, a traditional Zulu leader who blamed the foreigners living South Africa for its high crime rate and said they must 'take their bags and go'. He has been accused of 'igniting' the Zulus who comprise one of South Africa's largest ethnic groups by saying 'we must deal with our own lice' in a speech broadcast by a local radio station. The King has since said his words were misinterpreted but for some, Zwelithini simply articulated what many were feeling.

Battle: A South African police officer trains his sights on Zulu protesters who were demonstrated in front of their hostel in the Jeppestown district of Johannesburg (pictured) Retaliation: But police also claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other African countries - have largely subsided . The violence has also been blamed on high unemployment and while recent figures put it at 25 per cent, economists believe it is much higher and crippling the country with widespread poverty and a glaring class divide. Meanwhile foreign nationals have condemned South Africa's police for failing to protect them and even stirring hostility. The government says it is addressing complaints about undocumented migrants but many foreign nationals are living legally in South Africa and contributing to economic development. But the situation has become so severe that the government of Malawi has hired buses to repatriate 500 of its nationals, according to the country's Information Minister. Kenya has also offered to evacuate any of their citizens who feel threatened and on just today, Mozambique has temporarily blocked a road leading to South Africa. 60 people died during similar unrest in the country in 2008 and in January this year, four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted in Soweto, Johannesburg. Furious: A terrifying woman covered in black soot (pictured) began screaming at a group of foreign nationals in Johannesburg . Savage: Rioters have armed themselves with sticks, knives and baseball bats as they attack immigrants in Johannesburg (pictured) Rioters: The violence in South Africa has also been blamed on high unemployment and a glaring class divide .

One resident of the city said: 'This must become a lesson for them to return home... Otherwise, they will be eliminated one by one.\" It is also a major destination for asylum seekers and currently houses more than 300,000 of them according to projections by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

But while the scene looks idyllic, it is tinged with sadness, as Joel Wilkinson has a muscle wasting disease meaning he will eventually be left in a wheelchair and his life will be cut short. The three-year-old, from Hull, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just six months ago after his parents, Emma, 33, and Chris, 36, noticed he was struggling to develop and learn to walk. They were left devastated when tests confirmed their son had the incurable condition and that is likely only to live to the age of 20. Now, they have decided to make his short life as full of joy as possible. Joel Wilkinson, five, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy six months ago, meaning his muscles will slowly waste away. His sister Phoebe, five, adores him and cares for him as much as possible . Joel will eventually need a wheelchair and has a life expectancy of just 20.  Phoebe  plays only 'muscle friendly' games that won't tire her brother out - and refuses to play games at school unless Joel can join in . Phoebe makes sure her brother is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat (left), fetches his cereal in the morning and plays with him in the garden (right) Thankfully Joel's big sister, Phoebe, five, adores her brother and makes sure he is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat and even helps fetch him his cereals in the morning. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'We were heart broken when we discovered that Joel had such an awful terminal disease. 'We told Phoebe as soon as Joel was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that they're weaker than normal. 'It was important she understood so they could play games that wouldn't tire him such as playing with toys and painting. 'We've told them both that the doctors are trying to find a medicine to help. 'She now only plays \"muscle friendly\" games that don't involve Joel running around and getting extremely tired. 'Phoebe loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. It usually only affects boys (around one in 3,500), although girls can carry the defective gene. Although not apparent at birth symptoms appear in early childhood. Boys with Duchenne's will have difficulty with walking, jumping and climbing stairs. The disorder is diagnosed via a blood test and muscle tissue sample. Sufferers are likely to need increasing help and treatments from the age of nine. Walking becomes difficult and a wheelchair is usually needed by the age of 12. As patients go through their teenage years they are more likely to suffer from complications such as chest infections. Most most people with Duchennes survive well into their 20s and sometimes longer. The eventual cause of death is usually a severe chest infection at the stage when lung function is already poor. 'She openly tells their friends that she won't join in with any games unless Joel can keep up too. 'It's such a relief knowing that she's keeping an eye on him when I'm not around.' Mr and Mrs Wilkinson found out their son Joel had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just before his third birthday last year. The condition affects around one in 3,500 and causes difficulties with movement, meaning a wheelchair is normally needed by the age of 12. Mrs Wilkinson said she hopes there will be a scientific breakthrough before that point. She said: 'His only hope is that researchers have a breakthrough in time to save him and the hundreds of other boys who have this terrible disease. 'Joel will lose the use of his legs first, leaving him wheelchair-bound, and then other muscles thereafter. Eventually, his heart and lungs will fail. At first Joel's parents thought he was a late developer but when at six months he couldn't sit and by two he couldn't walk they knew something was seriously wrong. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Results from the blood test in July said he had muscle dystrophy, but it wasn't until the end of September, after more tests, that we found out it was Duchenne.' The disease, which results in muscle degeneration, has already left Joel unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances. Mrs Wilkinson added: 'Joel struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up. 'It's an awful illness but we are going to ensure that Joel has the best life and with Phoebe's help we know he'll enjoy every second. 'Phoebe will often clear away both of their toys so that her little brother doesn't get too tired. 'She will help him put on his shoes, fasten his coat and even helps him with his cereals in the morning. 'When I tell them both to tidy up their toys Phoebe will instantly stick up for him and say \"what about his weak muscles\". Emma Wilkinson, 33, and her husband Chris, 36, realised there was something wrong with their son when Joel wasn't developing properly. The family have now decided to make Joel's short life full of joy . As well as playing with her brother at home, Phoebe looks after Joel at school, spending break times with him . 'It's adorable but he's so spoilt.' Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy occurs mainly in boys and although it can be inherited it often occurs with no known family history of the condition. Mrs Wilkinson said this was the case for her and her husband, so they were shocked when Joel was diagnosed. She said: 'We have no family history of the condition so it has been such a shock for us to come to terms with but that's why we've set up the Joy for Joel appeal.' The family have set up at online fundraising website to ensure Joel he gets the specialist treatment he needs to make his life as comfortable as possible. 'We need funds to help Joel be as independent as possible when he grows up and so we can adapt our home,' Mrs Wilkinson explained. 'When he's older we will need a special hoist and a bedroom and wet room downstairs.' Until then, the family are focusing on creating as many memories as possible with Joel while he has some muscle function. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Thanks to Phoebe, Joel has a constant play mate and she helps him ensure he gets the most out of the time he has being able to move his muscles. 'There isn't any medication Joel can take that will slow down his muscle deterioration so we have to watch helplessly as he slowly becomes weaker. 'But we're trying to keep positive and with the help of Phoebe we are getting through it as a family.' There is no cure for Duchenne's, nor any medication that can slow  his muscle deterioration. But thanks to Phoebe, Joel  has a constant playmate . Often Phoebe will clear up Joel's toys after they have played together so he doesn't become to fatigued. 'It's adorable but he's so spoilt,' Mrs Wilkinson said . Mr Wilkinson, who works in IT development support at a logistics company, said: 'We cannot put into words the heartache and devastation Joel's diagnosis is causing us. 'Being unable to help, mend and protect your child is soul-destroying. 'The only thing we can do is bring joy to the time he has.' Families in a similar position can find support by contacting Muscular Dystrophy UK. Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the charity, said: 'Hearing that your child has a rare muscle-wasting condition can be a huge shock for parents. 'Families time and time again tell us about the importance of having a strong network in place. 'For many parents, family members and charities like Muscular Dystrophy UK, can play a major role in providing that much needed emotional support and practical help, throughout this journey. 'Many families have told us how they are struck by the sense of acceptance and resilience that a sibling can display as their brother or sister gradually gets weaker. 'Siblings can be very protective and supportive of each other, and will often find imaginative ways to play and have fun together despite mobility issues. 'This can be a huge source of comfort and reassurance for parents.' To donate visit: http://www.joyforjoel.co.uk ."}

An onlooker to Saturday’s drama said: ‘I heard a splash and a cheer went up, which is what normally happens when someone falls in. A woman was flapping about and two people in the punt jumped in and grabbed her. ‘It took them about 15 to 30 seconds to get to her and the whole thing only lasted a minute but she did go under a few times. It wasn’t nice to watch. For someone who can’t swim to be standing on a slippery punt is just bonkers. ‘The Cam is at least six to seven feet deep in places. Everyone involved was in shock and shaking afterwards.’ Meanwhile, Britons were  given their first taste of spring with temperatures reaching nearly 21C - marking the hottest day of the year so far. With forecasters predicting temperatures higher than in Rome and Athens, families flocked to parks, beaches and promenades across the UK to make the most of the balmy Easter weather.

Northumberland was one of the warmest areas today, although the high temperatures are likely to move south as the week goes on . The glimpse of sunshine brought families, swimmers, surfers and dog-walkers out in droves along the stretch of sand . Yesterday, highs of 20.5C were recorded in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire - some 4C higher than the previously recorded hottest day of the year. And according to experts, today's unseasonably warm weather is just the beginning of a week-long spell of sunshine, which could stick around until the end of the week. By Friday, temperatures could again reach highs of 21C in the south of England, prompting a glorious weekend of sunshine. That will come after a largely dry and bright week, which will see above average temperatures across most of the British Isles. Met Office Forecaster Craig Snell said: 'By Friday, it could be 19C or 20C down towards the south of England. Although it will be more unsettled across parts of Scotland, it will be a fine week for the second part of the Easter holidays.' Today, parts of Scotland and Northumberland basked in temperatures of 18C, while the mercury also hovered around 17C in parts of Devon and Cornwall, Somerset and the Midlands. But sea fog lingered over the north west keeping Blackpool and Cumbria murky. Parts of the south coast, including Brighton, Norfolk and East Anglia, also stayed cloudy, but saw some sunny spells. Mr Snell said this morning: 'North east England and the east coast of Scotland could experience the warmest day of the year so far where temperatures are expected to be between 17C and 18C. This three-day forecast shows sunny spells today across Scotland and south west of England, while the next few days will be warm, despite lingering cloud in some parts .

Sarah Anderson, 38, from Bournemouth, said: 'It definitely feels like winter is behind us and the temperatures are going to get hotter from now on. 'So often Bank Holidays in this country are a bit of a washout so when the sun comes out you have to make the most of it.' Meanwhile, a distressed pregnant woman was rescued from the sea after her yacht capsized. The woman was sailing with her partner when they were thrown from the boat and had to cling to the wreckage of the sinking trimaran near Dungeness, Kent. Dover Coastguard crews reached the couple after spotting a lit red flare and the pair were flown to William Harvey Hospital. Bob Giles, Dover Coastguard watch manager, said: 'The couple were thrown into the water after their vessel capsized. 'Both were wearing lifejackets and the man, ensured that his partner was safe, then tied a rope around himself and dived under the vessel to retrieve a flare so that he could alert rescuers to their position. 'Because they had AIS (automatic identification system) on board they were easy to locate and so were rescued quickly. The warmest Easter on record was in on April 23, 2011, when the mercury hit 27.8C. The coldest was on March 31, 2013, when it plunged to -12.5C.

Above, he accepts his trophy and crown of laurels this year . 'I'm happy for No. 1,' Desisa said. 'I am happy to win and for a strong Boston 2013.'

Rotich finished in an unofficial time of 2 hours, 24 minutes, 55 seconds, edging out Mare Dibaba of Ethiopia in a sprint finish on Boylston Street. 'I got to the last corner and I saw the finish line tape and I thought this is it, I'm not going to let it go,' said Rotich, who gave Kenya its fifth straight women's victory in Boston.

Carlos Arredondo, a first-responder that year, handed out American flags at the finish line on Monday, . The race comes less than three weeks after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the then-19-year-old Chechen Cambridge resident who brought bombs to the race, was found guilty of all the terrorism charges against him in a trial that saw moving testimony from victims who had lost loved ones and limbs. Tsarnaev, now 21, could face the death penalty after sentencing in federal court. Some victims of the attack have spoken out saying they are against capital punishment for the young man. Newlyweds Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the bombing, said that they support life without parole so that Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible,' according to the Boston Globe. 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance,' they said. Police presence at the Boston Marathon was high two years after the terrorist attack that claimed three lives and injured hundreds . Spectators at the event were made to pass through security checkpoints.

The fastest man in the Boston Marathon field, Kenya's Patrick Makau,  dropped out after the 5-kilometer checkpoint. It wasn't clear why he dropped out. The Kenyan's personal best of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 38 seconds made him one of the biggest threats to defending champion Meb Keflezighi's hopes of repeating Monday.

More than 700 Asiatic black bears, over a third of those held in captivity in Vietnam, have allegedly been butchered in the past year alone – with up to four bears inexplicably killed in one day on some farms. Farmers claim the extinction-threatened bears are dying from disease and old age – but sources say owners are killing them to 'extract the last ounce of blood' and selling their body parts to make Chinese medicine. Barbaric: A desperate moon bear with a left paw chopped off reaches out for help from its tiny rusty metal cage at the Cau Trang bear farm in Halong Bay, Vietnam . Metal coffins: The inhumane cages where tortured bears are forced to live in as they await death. The Vietnamese government faces a race against time to get them to a sanctuary in Tam Dao national park 120 miles away run by British charity Animals Asia . Confronted: The owner's son hides his face from MailOnline man at the Cau Trang bear farm in Halong Bay. He angrily told our man: 'You have no right to interfere in our business … If you take my picture I will sue you' The paws, meat and gall bladders of the 'moon bears' – named after the yellow moon-shaped crescents on their chests – are sold for the equivalent of £625 a bear and smuggled to China for use in traditional medicine, sources familiar with farm operations told MailOnline. Insiders say the bears are being massacred as the Vietnamese government attempts to crackdown on illegal bear bile farms. Today, only 1,245 of the animals remain in captivity in bear farms across the country compared to nearly 2,000 in 2014 and more than 4,000 in 2005. Officials want all the remaining animals held in captivity in Vietnam to be sent to sanctuaries where they can see out their days free from torment. But the owners won't see a penny in compensation if the bears are taken away and are killing them to sell their body parts before they can be removed, it is claimed. In Halong Bay, an idyllic seaside resort in northern Vietnam popular with Brit holidaymakers, a staggering 30 out of 49 captive bears held there have died in the last three months. The government has ordered the remaining 19 bears at Halong Bay to be taken to Tam Dao national park 120 miles away, a sanctuary run by British charity Animals Asia by September. Officials are under growing international pressure to rescue the animals. A raft of celebrities such as Judi Dench, Stephen Fry and Ricky Gervais have signed a petition calling on Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to save the remaining bears in Halong Bay. Skyfall star Dame Judi, 80, blasted: 'These moon bears have been used and abused by the cruel bile industry and are now being left to die. 'We are asking the Vietnam government to step in and enable Animals Asia to rescue these beautiful animals. They deserve their sanctuary.' In one  farm in Halong Bay, Cau Trang, 22 bears from just 27 in total have died since November. Four bears were reported to have died there in one day – raising suspicions the animals were killed to order. MailOnline dodged security guards to get into Cau Trang and witness the disgusting conditions the remaining five bears are forced to live. Packed into rusty metal cages, one of the bears lay motionless on the ground, seemingly giving up hope of ever being rescued. Another rocked manically from side to side and a third had a gushing head wound. A patch of dry ground 20 metres away from the cages was coated with clumps of bear fur. Two teenage guards with a dog confronted our man before phoning owner Nguyen Trong Bo's son, Hung. When he arrived at the farm, Hung was asked where the other 22 bears had gone. He replied with a sarcastic smirk – claiming: 'They have been released into the forest.' He refused to answer further questions and ordered us to leave, shouting angrily: 'You have no right to interfere in our business … If you take my picture I will sue you.' Butchered: Vietnam's moon bears are killed are sold for £625 each and smuggled to China for use in traditional medicine. Their paws, meat and gall bladders are used by men to increase sexual potency and cure hangovers . Death sentence: bears are being slaughtered and sold for their body parts to the lucrative trade in Chinese medicine . Cruel: 30 bears have died at illegal bile farms in the tourist resort of Halong Bay in the past three months. When contacted, one farm owner claimed his had all died from disease and old age. Bear bile farming was banned in Vietnam in 1992 . Bear owners are killing the animals to 'extract the last ounce of blood' out of them before officials force farmers to hand over the animals to wildlife sanctuaries. Greedy owners are demanding compensation from the government . Earlier his father Nguyen responded to a Vietnamese journalist, and claimed the four bears which died in one day at his farm were all aged over 20 and had been 'eating less' in recent months. Because of their endangered status – less than 100 moon bears remain in the wild in Vietnam – the death of any bear should be reported to local officials who are meant to oversee its post mortem and burial. But the sources told MailOnline official procedures are routinely bypassed and dead bears disposed of quickly by farmers on the pretext that the animals might have died from infectious diseases. Requests by animal welfare groups to inspect the bears are rebuffed and inquiries about burial sites brushed aside with explanations that bears might have been dug up by thieves, the sources said. The Prime Minister's office has instructed local officials and government departments to arrange the transfer of Halong Bay's surviving bears to the Animals Asia sanctuary. However, aid workers from Animals Asia say the process is being held up by greedy farmers' demands for compensation, and warns the remaining bears could be dead soon unless action is taken quickly. The charity's Vietnam director Tuan Bendixsen told MailOnline: 'We have received unconfirmed reports that bears are being deliberately killed and their body parts sold on the black market as bear farmers look for ways to recoup as much money as they can from the bears. 'Farmers are supposed to be caretakers of these animals. Selling a bear dead or alive is a criminal offence, as is failing to provide a proper level of care.' The charity founder, British nurse Jill Robinson MBE, who has saved countless bears from the cramped cages where they are kept, added: 'We are sickened to think that bears at death's door are possibly being slaughtered and exploited in such a mercenary way. As for the bears who have already died, who conducted post mortems? Who has disposed of the bodies and where are they? 'We, and thousands of supporters across the world, are heartbroken and frustrated that these slowly dying bears are not given the dignity of rescue and where necessary peaceful euthanasia after all they've suffered on the farms. 'For pity's sake, we implore the Prime Minister to release them from their pain, confiscate them in to our sanctuary, and allow our team to give them the love and care they deserve.' MailOnline man Simon Parry at the gates of Cau Trang bear farm in Halong Bay where 22 bears have died since November. Four died at the farm in a single day. Only five bears are left at Cau Trang . Bear bile farming involves crude catheters jabbed repeatedly into the caged bear's abdomen and gall bladder to drain out the fluid. This painful process takes place twice a day. The digestive juice contains Urso Deoxycholicacid (UCDA), a prized ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, an industry which is worth £1.5 billion. It can aid the treatment of liver and heart disease and reduce swelling when mixed with alcohol and rubbed on bruises. Men in China have also used bear bile as an aphrodisiac or to help cure hangovers. More recently it has been added to non-medicinal products such as wine and shampoo in China, the WSPA claims. Bile farming has been banned in Vietnam since 1992. In 2005 4,239 captive bears were micro chipped and farmers were told they could keep them but could not extract bile from them. But the cruel and illegal practice remains widespread. Until recently Korean, Japanese and Taiwanese tourists regularly visited bear farms in Halong Bay where they would buy bile and insist on watching it being extracted from bears to ensure it was genuine and fresh.

My husband and I see the TV star lazing with his little boy by one of the five swimming pools in the Martinhal Beach Resort in Portugal, soaking up the sun. The high-end resort, which opened in 2010, is renowned as being one of the best in the Algarve for a luxury family holiday. The beautiful Martinhal is a hit with families - and TV stars such as Ben Fogle . But despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes, the water is cold . Martinhal, which boasts a fine-dining restaurant, is the only five-star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach, and is set within 25 hectares in the protected Costa Vicentina Natural Park. So we’ve come to check it out – after all, why should the kids have all the fun? From the balcony in our chic Beach Room, we are afforded an incredible view over the glistening waters of the North Atlantic Ocean from the most south-westerly point in the Algarve. But despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes, don’t be fooled – the sea is sharp-intake-of-breath cold. Adventurer, author, broadcaster and writer Ben Fogle is a regular at Martinhal . Couples can overlook the ocean, read the papers, feast on fresh orange juice, and enjoy a classy breakfast . The resort boasts a stunning swimming pool surrounded by decking - and close to a restaurant . The boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort's hotel. There are also 152 hours and villas in the vicinity, so with 190 accommodation options, there is plenty of choice. We’re just a short walk from the main reception building, as well as the beach. Inside, the décor is minimalist and comfortable, soft pastel hues, blend well with the wooden floor, mixing stone, cork and other locally sourced materials for this British-designed interior. For larger families, there is the villa option – 23 award-winning, independently owned properties, with three or four large bedrooms, a parking space, a BBQ area as well as easy access to the facilities and swimming pools.

Martinhal, which boasts a fine-dining restaurant, is the only five-star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach, and is set within 25 hectares in the protected Costa Vicentina Natural Park . Holidaymakers can also choose to stay in villas at the high-end resort . There’s also a baby concierge service providing equipment to guests – including door protectors, potties, bottle sterilisers, cots, baths and pushchairs. It’s June and the place is busy – I’m told it’s almost at capacity, but the only time you can really tell how many people are staying here is at breakfast. It’s an all-you-can-eat buffet style option in the first-floor O Terraço restaurant – which offers a la carte dining in the evening. In the morning, there’s a hum of excitement; parents doing their best to feed their offspring who know exactly what they do and don’t want to eat. My husband and I eat on the terrace, overlooking the ocean, reading the papers, feasting on fresh orange juice, eggs cooked the way we like them, fresh fruit, cereal, pastries and croissants. After breakfast, there are seemingly endless options for children – from face painting, treasure hunts, arts and crafts, to windsurfing, dolphin watching, swimming tennis and football. M Bar, with its quirky decoration and VW camper van hiding in the corner,  is the place for a light lunch . The balcony offers a scenic view across the glistening waters of the North Atlantic Ocean . The view is breathtaking – sea-carved cliffs jut out around a long, wide beach which is warm beneath your toes . So while all that’s going on, the golden-sanded beach looks relatively deserted. We wander down, and the view is breathtaking – sea-carved cliffs jut out around a long, wide beach. There’s plenty of space, so even if everyone at the resort decided to spend the day at the beach, there’s room for them all. So I spend the morning soaking up the rays while Rich attempts paddleboarding for the first time. I’m not sure whether it was the fear of falling into the chilly water or that he is a natural, but he makes it all the way out to a small island without falling off – 15 minutes there and 15 back. For a day trip, Martinhal is located next to the historic fishing port of Sagres, one of Europe’s surfing capitals, which boasts rugged cliff faces, as well as a 15th-century port on the southern-most tip of the peninsular; giving it an end-of-the-world quality. For lunch, there a small shop where guests can buy their own food (although it is more expensive than other local shops due to being in-resort). Or there are three restaurants to choose from; As Dunas Beach Restaurant & Bar, overlooking the beach, offers fresh seafood dishes and a children’s menu; Gambozinos dishes up pizza and pasta; and M Bar is the place for a light lunch. There are also four bars across the resort. The boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort's hotel. There are also 152 hours and villas in the vicinity, so with 190 accommodation options, there is plenty of choice . unlike other posh restaurants, guests are welcome to bring their children. Couples seated near to us have babies by their sides, and our meal isn't disturbed in the slightest . and after treatments, there’s a garden relaxation area in which to chill out even further . My husband whiles away the afternoon with a swim followed by a game of tennis – there are two courts and Martinhal is home to the Algarve’s Padel Tennis Championships - while I book in for some serious pampering in the spa. Finisterra Spa lies apart from the rest of the resort and is an oasis of calm. There are six treatment rooms as well as a wet area with a sauna and steam bath – and after treatments, there’s a garden relaxation area in which to chill out even further. I can see this would be the perfect place for frazzled mums to recharge while their little ones are being looked after. I book for a 50-minute massage and leave feeling as though all my worries have been massaged away. We are booked into the fine dining O Terraço for our evening meal. With white tablecloths, a delicious-sounding menu and an extensive wine list, it really is the ultimate luxury. However, unlike other posh restaurants, guests are welcome to bring their children. Couples seated near to us have babies by their sides, and our meal isn't disturbed in the slightest. Our villa overlooks the stunning ocean - which is deceptively cold! For larger families, there is the villa option – 23 award-winning, independently owned properties, with three or four large bedrooms . With top quality regional restaurants from both the 'surf' and the 'turf', the restaurant offers a 'culinary journey through Portuguese gastronomy' presented with a modern twist. Dishes include braised scallops, beetroot puree, smoked ham and watercress as well as beef carpaccio, feta cheese, rocket and basil sauce for starters. Then there is octopus, sea bass, mussels, duck breast, sirloin and lamb for mains, with tofu curry or vegetable Wellington for vegetarians. There's an impressive cheeseboard to finish, as well as a selection of dessert wines. It’s a very grown-up finish to a luxury holiday in a resort which caters for families but is uncompromising in delivering high standards for all its guests.

'Should you after further consideration desire the remains of your Brother to be returned will you kindly telegraph us in the morning at the same time sending us a deposit of £20 for any expenses and land charges on the other Side and we will at once cable New York asking then to arrange this if practicable. James Moody was born in Scarborough in 1887, the son of John Henry Moody, a twon councillor, and Evelyn Louise Lammin. Privately schooled, he was sent away to King Edward VII Nautical School in London where he graduated with a masters in 1911. He went straight into service as an officer, first working on the Titanic's sister ship the Oceanic, before transferring to her ill-fated relative in 1912, then aged 24. Serving as the vessel's sixth junior officer, he set sail on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on April 14, 1912, along with 2,224 passengers and crew. Two days later, as the boat was passing through the northern Atlantic, Moody was on night watch when he received a call from one of the lookouts at 11.40pm. 'What do you see?' Moody asked. The man replied: 'Iceberg, right ahead!' After the collision, Moody was seen on deck all night, helping passengers into the lifeboats, and declining to go himself, despite all his junior officer colleagues escaping. He was last seen shortly before 2.20am, when the boat finally slipped under, still trying to launch more lifeboats. Today there is a memorial to him in Scarborough, with the inscription: 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' 'We also think it right to point out that the arrangements and expenses for taking charge of the remains after arrival of the steamer at Liverpool or Southampton would be on your account.' Instead, the company suggests that Mr Moody's remains be buried in Halifax with the other survivors, but they offer to send his family 'a photograph of the tombstone', if they want one. Even more shocking is the fact that Mr Moody's body had not been recovered by the time the letter was sent, and bosses would have known that, as all remains were cataloged. The remains of Mr Moody, who was on watch when the ship struck the iceberg and later helped passengers into the lifeboats while declining a space for himself, have never been found. Mr Moody was among the 1,500 passengers and crew to die aboard the Titanic when it sank in the north Atlantic on April 14 1912, two days into her maiden voyage. He had been serving as the Titanic's sixth officer, and was the only junior officer to perish after staying behind to help evacuate the passengers after the other officers left. Born in Scarborough in 1887 to John Henry Moody, a town councillor, and Evelyn Louise Lammin, James was privately educated before being sent to King Edward VII Nautical School in London. He passed his masters exams there in 1911 before becoming an officer. He was originally stationed on the Oceanic, the Titanic's sister ship, but transferred just months before the disaster in 1912. The letter has come to light after being listed for auction by a collector who acquired it directly from Moody's family. Experts at Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, have described the two-page letter as 'beyond comprehension' and say it could make £25,000 when it goes under the hammer. Mr Moody (front left), 24, was the Titanic's sixth officer, and the only junior officer to die on board while helping passengers into the lifeboats, long after his colleagues had abandoned ship . The Titanic (pictured), sank on April 14, 1912, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, after colliding with an iceberg in the northern Atlantic . Andrew Aldridge, from the auctioneers, said: 'White Star Line is asking for £20, which was a colossal amount of money in 1912, for the return of the body of one of their own officers. 'The mere concept of requiring payment for the return of the body of anyone who died on Titanic - let alone one of the ship's officers - is just beyond comprehension. 'It is an horrific act on the part of White Star. You can't imagine how Christopher Moody must have felt to have been greeted with a letter like this when he was grieving for the loss of his brother. 'What's more, the £20 White Star were asking for did not cover getting the body home or to the undertakers once it arrived in England. 'But where this letter is most shocking is the fact that Moody's body had not been - and never was - recovered in the aftermath. 'When this letter was sent the recovery ships had already arrived in New York and the bodies they had found had been identified and catalogued. 'You would like to think the sending of this letter was an administrative error but it's open to a lot of interpretation. 'The implications are huge - how many families of the deceased did White Star ask for payment from? 'James Moody was an incredibly brave man, helping to get passengers into liferafts and choosing to stay with the ship until the bitter end. 'It appears that White Star treated his body as a commodity, which callous in the extreme.' RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. More than 1,500 people died when the ship sank carrying 2,224 passengers and crew under the command of Edward Smith. Some of the wealthiest people in the world were onboard the ship, including property tycoon John Jacob Astor IV, great grandson of John Jacob Astor, founder of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim, heir to his family’s mining business, also perished, along with Isidor Straus, the German-born co-owner of Mancy's department store. The ship was the largest afloat at the time and was designed in such a way that it was meant to be 'unsinkable'. It had an on-board gym, libraries, pool as well as several restaurants and luxury first class cabins. There were not enough lifeboats on board for all the passengers due to out-of-date maritime safety regulations. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown in Ireland before heading to New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing she hit an iceberg at 11:40pm ship's time. James Moody was on night watch when the collision happened, and took the call from the watchman, asking him 'what do you see?', the man responded: 'Iceberg, dead ahead.' By 2.20am, with hundreds of people still on board, the ship plunged beneath the waves, taking many, including Moody, with it. Despite repeated distress calls being sent out, and flares launched from the decks, the first ship arrived nearly two hours later, pulling 710 people from the water. It was not until 73 years later that the wreck of the ship was discovered on the ocean floor."}

Google introduced the app in February as a 'safer' place for kids to explore videos because it was restricted to 'family-focused content.' But the consumer activists say the app is so stuffed with advertisements and product placements that it's hard to tell the difference between entertainment and commercials. Scroll down for video . The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons (pictured): a TV set for popular TV shows such as Yo Gabba Gabba, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos . Along with favorites from DreamWorksTV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends and more, your kids can watch new series from YouTube channels they already like. National Geographic Kids; Reading Rainbow; and Thomas the Tank Engine leave the world of Sodor for the first time in 70 years to travel the globe. One example is a 7-minute video of Disney's 'Frozen' characters who appear as dolls inside a toy McDonald's, eating ice cream and drinking Sprite. The activists say digital media should be subject to the same rules as television, which limits commercial content on kids' programming. 'As a consumer, you should have the right to know who is trying to persuade you,' said Angela Campbell with the Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown Law, who provided legal counsel to the coalition. In young children especially, 'it takes unfair advantage of their trusting nature and lack of experience,' she added. In a statement early Tuesday, YouTube said:  'We worked with numerous partners and child advocacy groups when developing YouTube Kids. 'While we are always open to feedback on ways to improve the app, we were not contacted directly by the signers of this letter and strongly disagree with their contentions, including the suggestion that no free, ad-supported experience for kids will ever be acceptable. ' We disagree and think that great content shouldn't be reserved for only those families who can afford it.' Since its inception in 2005, YouTube has become the world's most popular online video site, with more than 1 billion users. For parents, it's become an easy way to find Elmo song clips or full episodes of 'Barney & Friends.' But when searching for Elmo or Barney, it's easy to pull up other user-generated content aimed at adults, such as the two puppets cursing or waving guns. 'Now, parents can rest a little easier knowing that videos in the YouTube Kids app are narrowed down to content appropriate for kids,' wrote Shimrit Ben-Yair, the app's product manager, in a February blog post. According to the consumer groups' letter, the videos mingle commercial and entertainment content in ways that wouldn't be allowed on television. Search for 'My Little Pony,' for example, and the first several options are lengthy advertisements for My Little Pony Play-Doh and toy kitchen sets, including one Play-Doh segment stretching 19 minutes. 'The fact that children are viewing the videos on a tablet or smartphone screen instead of on a television screen does not make it any less unfair and deceptive,' the letter states. Groups that signed the letter were the Center for Digital Democracy, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Children Now, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Watchdog, Consumers Union, Corporate Accountability International and Public Citizen. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. A stock image of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street is shown . 'Like most parents, I love helping my kids learn more about something they're interested in,' said Shimrit Ben-Yair, mother of two and YouTube Kids Group Product Manager. 'For example, right now, I spend a lot of time on YouTube with my 3-year-old son, who loves watching videos of car washes, Super Simple Songs, and about the universe. 'Today, we're introducing the YouTube Kids app, the first Google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind. 'The app makes it safer and easier for children to find videos on topics they want to explore, and is available for free on Google Play and the App Store in the U.S.' The app includes a timer to limit kids' screen time, sound settings to turn off background music and sound effects, and search settings to limit your children to just the pre-selected videos available on the home screen. Ben-Yair, the project's group product manager, told USA Today that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year-on-year, but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels. 'Parents were constantly asking us, can you make YouTube a better place for our kids,' she said. In answer, the company has come up with an app that is simple to use and eliminates features such as viewer comments from the design. Research show that children are just three clicks away from adult content on YouTube . The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons: a TV set for popular TV shows such as Sesame Street, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos. The categories are called: Shows, Music, Learning and Explore. 'The images are big as are the tap targets for small fingers, and since most younger children can't type they can search with voice,' Ms Ben-Yair said. If children try and search for a raunchy video, for example, the app simply blocks the request and a box that reads 'Try something else' pops up. They will be able to search for topics they are curious about though, such as spaceships and find how-to-make a volcano and maths tutorials, for example. The app will also give parents more power over their children's viewing habits. It will give them features to control the time children spend on the app so that it shuts down after a number of minutes or hours. It can be re-started again once a password is entered. There will also be an option to mute videos - a feature tested by families and NGOs. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. 'The news that YouTube plans to launch a kid-friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents,' said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab. 'Our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform. 'Examining YouTube's 'suggested' videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children's television programmes such as Peppa Pig, Rastamouse and Dora the Explorer, our researchers have found that, on average, users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience.' The child-focused app will in part compete with Netflix's Kids service and Vine's child-friendly app showing age-appropriate video clips. The move would appear to be part of Google's strategy to appeal to younger users. YouTube is owned by the search giant. Google recently acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic, and has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome and Search, as well as YouTube. Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to develop a new version of the View-Master, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. The virtual reality device makes use of Google's Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called '360 degree photospheres'. To release the phone's virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel's app is needed. View-Master gets a make-over! Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. An illustration of the new device is shown . The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play. The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive. Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take 'engaging field trips' so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in 'photospheres'. By pairing an 'experience reel' with a smartphone, children 'will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,' the company says. The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10). Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year."}

However, you might be more surprised to see shot glasses emblazoned with David Cameron's face, UKIP pendents and even party leader underwear appearing on shelves. This year's election has bought with it a bizarre batch of merchandise in a bid to sway the nation. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is said to have watched Bake Off in the past which could explain these cake cases . Many of the unusual trinkets can be purchased on the official party websites which often include a 'gift' category, should you want to bring politics into their special day. Perhaps dad might like an SNP decanter for his wine, or mum could bake in her new set of Conservative cupcake cases, while Ukip have focused on a more wearable range of accessories. We're not entirely sure that any of these will fly off the shelves but here we round up the weirdest official - and unofficial -  collectibles as we prepare to go to the polls. CONSERVATIVE CUPCAKE CASES . David Cameron has previously revealed that he has watched The Great British Bake Off, which might explain these rather pricey cupcake cases. The pack of 36 patriotic cases, in Tory blue with a Union Jack design, comes in at £5 a pop. UKIP PENDANT . We know it isn't advisable to wear your heart on your sleeve but what about your political opinion around your neck? This Cornish Pewter pendant is available from the party's store for £12 and is described as an 'ideal gift for Ukip enthusiasts'. Political party underwear insures that politicians remain the butt of the joke . LEADER UNDERWEAR . Political leaders are used to being the butt of the jokes, and one retailer has taken this a step further. Twisted Tee, has created a range of 'political man pants' - capacious white garments printed with the faces of the party leaders. The pair of Nick Clegg undies are described in ironic terms: 'Hand printed gingerly in London on to 100 per cent white cotton Y front. 'For men who don't quite know whether they dress to the right or left.' DAVID CAMERON SHOT GLASS . The David Cameron shot glass is one way of getting you through the lengthy process . A set of David Cameron shot glasses could be the perfect excuse for a general election drinking game. Now CafePress is offering the custom ceramic vessels emblazoned with the Prime Minister's picture for £11 each. Knock back a shot for every time he says 'hard working people' however, and you may find yourself needing to make cuts of your own. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 18TH BIRTHDAY CARDS . Keen to snap up new voters the minute they become of age, the Lib Dems have created their own 18th birthday cards. The plain cards simply say, 'Wishing You a Happy Birthday' above the figure '18' written out in blue and filled with the party's yellow bird logo. If anyone knows a large number of 17-year-olds with birthdays looming, the party's official store offers the cards in packs of 100 for £34. SNP PICNIC BLANKET . The SNP picnic blanket is the ideal way to showcase your political opinion in the great outdoors . The SNP, with a revitalised Nicola Sturgeon at the helm, are dedicated to getting their message out there. So dedicated in fact that they are not prepared to miss a single opportunity to spread the word.

With this handy high viz vest you can showcase your political orientation with pride in all hazardous situations and for the meagre price of £8. The e-cigarette liquid comes in five flavours one for each of these leaders . ELECTION E-CIGARETTE FLAVOURS . In a bizarre addition to the already unusual election memorabilia being sold, Totally Wicked's Red Label has produced five e-cigarette liquids pairing with five of the party leaders. Varieties include Cameron's Eton Mess, a strawberry and meringue flavour inspired by the PM's old school. Miliband's Rocky Red is based on the seaside treat of teeth-cracking rock as 'being leader of the opposition is often described as the worst job in British politics, so where better to escape to for a break than the great British seaside, famous not just for being a great holiday destination but also for hosting many party political conferences.' For an e-cigarette inspired by Nigel Farage, the site says: 'We all know Nigel Farage likes his ciggies and a pint, now it turns out he is also a vaper! So we've made this e-liquid especially for him. A full tobacco flavour with a dash of beer, topped with a note of espresso.' The official Conservative shop is selling baby clothes meaning they can start their opinions early . MINI THATCHER BABY CLOTHES . Many parents are known to push their views on to their offspring and in this case they're starting early. The official Conservative website stocks baby clothes including Babygros and bibs with Little Iron Lady (Margaret Thatcher's famous nickname printed on the front.) Baby's first election might be more appropriate. You can now own Nick Clegg's apology on MP3 with proceeds going towards a children's charity . NICK CLEGG, I'M SORRY- THE SINGLE . Re-live Nick Clegg's apology over the Liberal Democrats' climbdown on tuition fees in full auto-tune glory with this MP3 edition with an album cover mocked up to resemble The Clash's seminal album, London Calling. Available to buy for £0.99, the proceeds go towards The Children's Hospital Charity. SNP DECANTER . It appears that the SNP area about ready to brand just about anything. This crystal decanter engraved with 'Scottish N Proud' would make an excellent novelty gift during the election. With a £75 price tag, however, it may make an awkward heirloom if the SNP aren't elected. But on election night itself, what better way to pass the time as the votes are counted. UKIP LADIES SILK SCARF . Want an elegant way to showcase your support for Nigel Farage and his party? Look no further than Ukip's silk 'pound' logo printed on a pale, sheer scarf. The party's website assures that it is a 'delicate chiffon' in a 'gentle lilac' so as to avoid being too ostentatious. And although it may feature a pound sign pattern, it is a thrifty purchase coming in at £3. The UKIP silk scarf is supposed to be the sophisticated way of showing your support for the party . These life sized cardboard cutouts make a great addition to the office...apparently . PARTY LEADER CARDBOARD CUT-OUT . Some might say there's not much difference between our biggest political figures and these cardboard cut-outs. Fortunately we can find out for ourselves as the  free-standing Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg figures are available at Amazon for £29.99. For those of you unsure of what you would do with a life size political leader, the website provides the following suggestions: 'Suitable for gifts, bedroom decoration, home theatre decoration, wall decoration, kid's bedrooms, office desks and parties.'

The SNP tea-light holder literally allows you to hold a candle to Nicola Sturgeon . What better way to hold a candle to your favourite party than with an actual candle. It's less ostentatious than some other SNP souvenirs but it still has a certain glow... for £15 a holder. UKIP DOG T-SHIRT . We're assuming this is for a canine who is not a Farage fan judging by the gesture on the reverse, but last time we checked dogs can't vote anyway. But if you wish to cause a stir in the park opt for this £17.95 tee from Zazzle."}
{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1908, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "Isabelle Obert, a nutrition consultant, believes a good diet can affect the health of the sperm and the egg before they even meet . One in seven couples have trouble conceiving - and it's often not clear why. But one nutritionist argues that a good diet can affect the health of the sperm and the egg before they even meet. Isabelle Obert, who runs Nurture Me Fertility, believes a diet rich in minerals, vitamins, essential fats and proteins can prepare both a man and a woman's body for conception. Writing for Healthista.com, Ms Obert said: 'I believe passionately that good nutrition is important for 'good' fertility. 'Many of us are leaving it until much later to start trying for a family, by which time our fertility may not be what it was. 'We will have been exposed to more hormone disrupting chemicals, more free radicals to damage egg and sperm quality and of course much more stress - which can have wide-ranging negative effects on our bodies.' She goes on to explain how the health of both the sperm and the egg - even before they meet -  can affect the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the baby, child and even through to adulthood. Ms Obert adds: 'I also think food should be fun, delicious, moreish, colourful, fantastic. We should live to eat, not eat to live.' Here, she reveals her list of ten top foods to boost fertility, plus some tips on how to prepare them... AVOCADOS . Avocados are nutritional powerhouses packed with minerals, vitamins, essential fats, protein, carbohydrate and fibre. They are a fantastic source of vitamin E, which studies have shown can be beneficial in improving endometrial lining (the lining of the uterus). They can also help with embryo implantation, which is how a fertilised egg becomes a pregnancy. Avocados are also an excellent source of folate. It is known that consuming foods high in folate - as well as taking a folic acid supplement - can help prevent spina bifida. 'Avocados are nutritional powerhouses packed with minerals, vitamins, essential fats, protein, carbohydrate and fibre,' Ms Obert said . Top Tip: Choose carefully as a ripe avocado is nectar — sliced onto wholemeal or rye toast, topped with cherry tomatoes, basil and a drizzle of peppery extra virgin olive oil makes a nutritious and delicious breakfast. BUTTERNUT SQUASH . This is one of the most nutritious and healthy vegetables you can eat, with a rich array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants - as well as significant amounts of digestible fibre. It's rich in beta-carotene, which is known to help boost production of the hormone progesterone. It can also help increase both sperm quality and count, the latter according to a study published in the medical journal Fertility and Sterility. Ms Obert recommends beetroot juice for women undergoing IVF treatment as a way to improve blood flow to the uterus to help with embryo implantation . Top Tip: Butternut squash is hugely versatile -it’s delicious roasted with garlic, thyme and black pepper, or spice it up in a warming curry or soup. BEETROOT . A fantastic source of the antioxidant resveratrol, which is thought to help combat against age- related infertility, beetroots are also rich in nitrates. These are well known to improve blood flow and are often used by athletes for this purpose. I particularly recommend beetroot juice for women undergoing IVF treatment as a way to improve  blood flow to the uterus to help with embryo implantation. Top Tip: Forget pickled beetroots from school lunch days — try quartering small fresh beetroot, tossing with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and whole garlic cloves. Add some fresh oregano, thyme or marjoram, place in a tinfoil pouch to avoid burning and roast in a hot oven. SALMON . Salmon is a great protein source, rich in many nutrients but particularly anti-inflammatory omega 3. Research has shown that optimal levels of omega 3 are important in the management of female infertility. For general health, salmon is excellent for the cardiovascular system, boosting brain function and eye health. Ideally it should be wild or organic in order to avoid unnecessary pesticides, fungicides and excessive omega 6 consumption found in conventionally farmed fish. Top Tip: Salmon works beautifully with oriental flavours - try it grilled with a teriyaki glaze and a crunchy vegetable stir-fry. Butternut squash is rich in beta-carotene, which is known to help boost production of the hormone progesterone and increase sperm quality and count . POMEGRANATES . In ancient Persia, pomegranates were seen as a symbol of fertility and this still exists today in some countries. In fact, research shows that drinking pomegranate juice during pregnancy may prevent brain damage in babies. Pomegranates are also rich in many nutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin K, folic acid and several other vitamins and minerals. And they are known to have anti-ageing properties, anti-cancer properties, can be helpful for cardiovascular health and bone health and have anti-inflammatory properties as well as helping boost blood flow. Top Tip: Incorporate pomegranate seeds with quinoa, walnuts and fresh mint for a Middle Eastern experience. Pomegranats are rich in vitamin C, vitamin K and folic acid. They also boost blood flow, which is important for people trying to conceive . EGGS . Eggs are among the most nutritious foods you can eat — after all, they contain the nutrients to turn a single cell into a baby chicken. They are rich in choline, which studies have shown can have significant positive effects on foetal development that may have a lasting influence into adult life, according to a study at Cornell University. Eggs are also rich in many different vitamins and minerals, as well as essential fats, and of course are an excellent source of protein. Not only this, they are good value and have a multitude of uses. Walnuts are beneficial for sperm quality as they are good sources of omega 3 and vitamin E . Top Tip: When time and inclination are in short supply, why not top a wholemeal English muffin with wilted spinach, a poached egg and some black pepper for highly nutritious simple supper. WALNUTS . Walnuts are packed with health-giving nutrients which include cancer fighting properties (they’re known to reduce prostate and breast cancer risk). They can be beneficial for sperm quality, are excellent sources of omega 3 fats and vitamin E, which is great for endometrial health, as well as B vitamins and protein. In fact, walnuts could be called ‘king’ among nuts and, according to a study by the Society for the Study of Reproduction at UCLA, a handful of walnuts daily was linked with increased sperm vitality, motility and morphology. This means how healthy and fast sperm are, and whether they are normal-shaped. Top Tip: Eat raw as a simple snack or add flavour and crunch to boost a superfood salad. QUINOA . This little seed is highly nutritious, a complete protein. It’s gluten-free and rich in many minerals and vitamins as well fatty acids and fibre – a great alternative to starchy grains such as couscous and bulgar wheat. A real superfood. The Mediterranean diet is widely recommended for optimal fertility, as it is rich in vegetable proteins, and quinoa makes the perfect addition as it goes without saying protein requirements are raised when trying to conceive and during pregnancy. Top Tip: Quinoa cooks like rice, top with vegetables roasted with plenty of garlic and herbs, drizzle with fruity olive oil and sprinkle with toasted pine nuts for a Mediterranean treat. Protein requirements are raised during pregnancy, and quinoa is a great source of protein, Ms Obert said . WATERCRESS . Watercress is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family and rich in many nutrients including vitamin C, vitamin K, calcium, beta-carotene, iron and iodine — which is often lacking in the Western diets of today. Asparagus is high in folic acid, which is well-known to be important for male and female fertility . Watercress is well known to be a superfood, rich in age-defying antioxidants that may help to prevent or slow the oxidative stress induced by free radical damage. Several studies have found watercress has significant anti-cancer properties and can help repair DNA damage. Top Tip: What a crime to use just as a garnish — make it the main attraction in soups and salads. ASPARAGUS . Asparagus is high in the potent antioxidant vitamin C and folate (folic acid) amongst other health giving nutrients and a valuable addition to your diet. The importance of folate is well documented in research for both male and female fertility. Top Tip: Lightly steam asparagus and dip into boiled eggs, or grill and sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and shavings of parmesan."}

The First Minister, who has previously said merely that 'something substantial' would have to change before the SNP held a second independence referendum, said a Tory government seeking to take Scotland out of the EU against its will would be a trigger. The Scottish Nationalists lost last year's independence referendum by 55 per cent to 45 per cent, having previously suggested it was a 'once in a generation' event. David Cameron speaks to supporters during a Conservative Party rally  in Sandymoor, Cheshire . Miss Sturgeon told the Mail that an EU exit would be 'something substantive... change in circumstances' that would mean a second Scottish independence referendum was necessary. 'It's if there was a vote that ended up taking Scotland out against our will. That's the only concrete example,' she said. 'I'm quite clear: a vote for the SNP at this election, I'm not taking that as a mandate for another referendum. So it would have to be something like the EU situation. 'It's if there was an out vote across the UK and Scotland wants to stay in. I suspect if we were in those circumstances there would be a clamour of people across Scotland to look again at the independence question, whether I'm proposing it or not. 'But what I'm talking about with a change of circumstances, it's not me trying to pluck out the conditions out of thin air. I do mean it - there will have to be a change in circumstances and we haven't even started the process of the 2016 manifesto [for Scottish Parliament elections] yet. 'If I put a commitment to a referendum in any future SNP manifesto, people have to vote for that manifesto so I can't do that lightly. I have to be sure that there is a change of circumstances that has led to people by majority opinion wanting another referendum.' Miss Sturgeon, who received a rock star welcome from party faithful as she launched her blueprint for power near Edinburgh yesterday, was scathing about Labour's economic plans. 'Labour like to talk the langauge of anti austerity but the substance of the proposals is not anti austerity,' she said. 'This is not all about conversations between me and Ed Miliband. I know for a fact there are plenty of folk in the Labour ranks that agree with me on austerity more than they agree with Ed Miliband. 'There will be support. One of Ed Miliband's shadow ministers has said he would never vote for the renwal of Trident. Yes, people focus on talks between the leaders but what I'm saying is that we'll try to forge alliances across the Commons. The Prime Minister today warned that Miss Sturgeon would hold the UK to 'ransom' if the SNP holds the balance of power in May . The SNP have vowed never to strike a deal to keep David Cameron in Number 10 - whatever the result of the election . 'We will prevail on some things, we won't prevail on others. We would like to build those alliances with people of like mind across different parties.' The First Minister said she had been 'surprised' by messages of support from people in England and Wales who said they wished they could vote SNP. 'After the first leaders' debate it pleasantly surprised me. As a proportion of everyone in England it was a tiny proportion but it was a lot - I still get a lot of emails saying \"we wish we could vote SNP\". There are people in England saying \"I wish Labour was saying these things. I wish we had a progressive alternative.\" 'That's why I do think David Cameron is making a mistake trying to base so much of his campaign on the assumption that people are afraid of the SNP. People are very frustrated. This is borne out in the polls. There is not a clear enough big enough decision and divide between the two main parties.' Ed Miliband insisted he would not be held to ransom by the SNP . Asked about voters' fears in the rest of the UK at the prospect of a separatist party wielding power, which led to the Mail dubbing her 'The Most Dangerous Woman in Britain', she joked: 'I thought it was possibly one of the nicest things the Daily Mail had ever said about me.' Brandishing a picture in her manifesto of her hugging a small child on the campaign trail, she asked: 'Do I look like one of the most dangerous women in Britain? Come on! I don't think that's how people in England see the SNP. 'That's not to say they agree with us on independence - many do, but many don't - but I don't think many people in England see the SNP as this big bogeyman threat. 'If there are some people that do, I take my responsibility seriously to persuade them that they are wrong and I do accept that I have a big responsibility in how I conduct the campaign and how I speak to people both in and outside Scotland to persuade people that there's not anything to be scared of from having the SNP in big numbers both inside and outside Scotland.' She insisted that she - not Mr Salmond or the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson - would lead hung Parliament negotiations if, as polls predict, the party takes as many as 50 seats and holds the balance of power at Westminster. 'I'll be there,' she said. 'I'm the leader of the SNP, I'll be in charge of any decisions and negoaitions and anything that happens after May 7.' Miss Sturgeon denied that a hung parliament, led by a minority Labour government propped up vote-by-vote by the SNP, would be a recipe for chaos which would further undermine voters' trust in Parliament. 'My experience of being in a minority government - and it's a very direct experience of being deputy leader in a minority government for four years... it can, contrary to what you are saying about reducing trust in politics, can have the opposite effect because the public see politicians having to win arguments rather than votes by sheer force of numbers. The experience of minority government in Scotland was stable - clearly, because it lasted for four years. 'So based on that experience I have a different view of what a minority government situation and I don't think it has to be unstable or ineffective. On the contrary.' Miss Sturgeon said the coalition's fixed term parliaments legislation would strengthen the SNP's hand. It means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years, and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times. Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election. 'The Fixed Term Parliaments Act does make it possible to change a government's position without threatening the existence of that government... including a budget, though I must say I'm not going into this trying to block a budget. That's not the mindset we are taking into this. 'But the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, in a House of Commons context, has made the prospect of a minority government a much more viable one.' Miss Sturgeon said she had been surprised to be told that the Prime Minister was not prepared to sit alongside her at the end of their separate interviews on Sunday's Andrew Marr Show, as guests traditionally do. 'I would have been quite happy to sit next to him,' she said."}

Police have not disclosed his identity and family do not know who he is, but a police report confirmed the man was detained with Scott and put in the back of a police car, according to CNN. The man, who is not a relative, could be able to shed light on what happened between Officer Michael Slager pulling the pair over - and the beginning of the bystander video which shows Scott being shot dead. The 33-year-old patrolman has been charged with murder after 50-year-old Walter Scott was gunned down last Saturday in North Charleston, South Carolina. It has also been revealed that the officer was allowed to stay with the force, despite being the subject of a complaint that alleged he used excessive force on an unarmed man. Police are now reviewing the earlier case in light of the shooting of Mr Scott. Patrolman Michael Slager calling colleagues on his radio after shooting dead the unarmed father-of-four Walter Scott . Officer Michael Slager, pictured left in his police mugshot, has been charged with the murder of 50-year-old Walter Scott, right . Eyewitness accounts said Scott was involved in a brief scuffle on the ground with the officer who pulled his car over for having a broken tail light. Mr Scott can be seen being shot five times in the back as he ran away from the armed officer in video footage that was captured on a mobile phone at the scene. The incident started at 9.53am when officer Slager radioed into his control saying that he was pulling over a grey coloured Mercedes. Minutes later he appears out of breath as he describes chasing a suspect on foot, who he says is black and wearing a green t-shirt. This is followed by a period of no contact from the patrolmen, despite colleagues en-route to assist asking for his location. Slager then makes a further frantic call to dispatchers at 9.38am after firing eight shots at Mr Scott. 'Shots fired. Subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,' After shooting Mr Scott, Slager can be heard telling his control: 'I need to secure my vehicle.' A second officer, named as Clarence Habersham, then uses his radio to report that the victim has gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. Slager, 33, who is white, initially defended his actions, saying he feared for his life after he alleged Mr Scott had wrestled his Taser from him during a scuffle. But four days later, anonymous cellphone footage emerged that contradicted his account of events. The video showed the officer firing eight shots at Mr Scott from around 20 feet away while he had his back turned and was fleeing. The officer draws his weapon as Mr Scott, 50, breaks free and starts to flee from the scene . The officer fires off eight shots hitting the fleeing father in the back five times . Mr Scott collapses to his knees after being struck after shots were fired . Slager then handcuff's Mr Scott's lifeless body before he allegedly appears to tamper with the scene . Slager, 33,  initially claimed that he feared for his life after Mr Scott wrestled his Taser from him in a scuffle . Sagler then cuffed Mr Scott's lifeless body and was seen dropping an object - possibly his service-issue Taser - by his side. In the video filmed by Feidin Santana there appears to be no evidence of Mr Scott getting hold of the officer's Taser or using it against him. 'I remember the police [officer] had control of the situation,' said Mr Santana. 'He had control of Scott. And Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser. But like I said, he never used the Taser against the cop.' Officer Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday and now could face the death penalty. Today Mario Givens revealed how he made a complaint about Slager in September 2013 and claimed the shooting of Mr Scott could have been prevented. He told how he was awoken before dawn in September 2013 by the patrolman, who was banging on the front door of his family home in North Charleston. Givens, who is also black, said he cracked open his door and asked the officer what he wanted. 'He said he wanted to come in, but didn't say why,' said Givens, now 33. 'He never said who he was looking for.' Officer Slager, 33, can be seen on video holding an object - possibly his Taser - after he shot dead Walter Scott . Officer Michael Slager was caught on video tape on Saturday picking up an object - possibly his Taser - from where the confrontation started with Walter Scott and appearing to move it over to the father-of-four's dead body . Then, without warning, Slager pushed in the door, he said. '`Come outside or I'll tase you,'' he recalled the officer saying as he burst in. 'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway.' He said the pain from the stun gun was so intense that he dropped to the floor and began calling for his mother, who was also in the home. At that point, he said another police officer came into the house and they dragged him outside and threw him to the ground. He was handcuffed and put in the back of a squad car. Though initially accused of resisting the officers, Givens was later released without charge. Angered by what happened, Givens went downtown to police headquarters the following day and filed a formal complaint. He and his mother say several neighbors who witnessed what happened on the family's front lawn also contacted the police, though they say officers refused to take their statements. Asked about the 2013 incident, North Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said the department now plans to review the case to see if its decision to exonerate Slager was correct. 'It could have been prevented,' Givens said of Scott's death. 'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today.' Authorities refused to say on Wednesday whether other police officers will be charged in the cover-up of an unarmed black father's fatal shooting by a white cop. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey would not answer questions on the involvement of other members of the force in the killing of Walter Scott, 50. The 33-year-old patrolman, who is white, initially defended his actions, saying he feared for his life after Scott wrestled his Taser gun from him during a scuffle when he pulled him over for a broken brake light on Saturday morning. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey (pictured left) refused to say whether other officers were involved in the fatal shooting of unarmed black father, Walter Scott, on Saturday. Police chief Eddie Driggers avoided some questions but did say he had been sickened by video of his officer shooting the man dead . Four days later, anonymous cellphone footage emerged and blew Slager's story wide open. The video showed the officer firing eight shots at Scott, a father-of-four, from around 20 feet away while the man had his back turned and was fleeing. Sagler then cuffed Scott's lifeless body and was seen dropping an object - possibly his service-issue Taser - by his side. The cop was charged with murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. During a chaotic press conference on Wednesday, demonstrators grew angry after the mayor took over questions directed at Police Chief Eddie Driggers who stepped back from the podium. Mayor Summey refused to answer questions on other cops' involvement, citing an independent investigation underway by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Slager was fired one day after his murder charge but his wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will still receive insurance from the city until after her baby was born because it was the 'humane thing to do', the mayor said. This as the FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights prosecutors announced on Wednesday there would be a federal probe . Chief Driggers told the press conference that he was 'sickened' by the video and had watched it only once. No other officers had seen what happened at the shooting scene, according to Driggers. When asked why no one had performed CPR on Scott, Driggers then said he believed one cop had taken off Scott's shirt and tried to perform life-saving measures. Driggers said that he had spoken to Walter Scott Sr 'father to father' during a visit to the grieving family's home."}

Los Angeles judge Richard Fruin Jr. awarded Shelly Sterling most of the nearly $3million she had sought. Lawyers for Sterling had claimed that money used to buy V. Stiviano a house, luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage. Stiviano's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when Donald and Shelly were separated and that Shelly Sterling couldn't seek them from a third party. Scroll down for video . Shelly Sterling has been awarded nearly all of the $3 million she had sought to be returned from V. Stiviano, who had argued that the gifts were made when Donald Sterling was separated from his wife . Tuesday's ruling comes nearly a year after Stiviano's recording of Donald Sterling making racially offensive remarks bounced him from the NBA and cost him team ownership. Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings to show he bought Stiviano a house, a Ferrari and other things. In the recordings on Stiviano's iPhone, she and the 80-year-old billionaire are heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the entire house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Donald Sterling had given Stiviano a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex . Donald Sterling said Stiviano hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the house and, noting that Stiviano is part black and Hispanic, said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending Hispanic bank and escrow employees. Shelly Sterling filed the suit against Stiviano about a month before the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. In closing arguments, late last month, Shelly Sterling's lawyer had relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy. Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8 million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills. While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6 million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1 million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings. V. Stiviano, 32, pictured arriving at Los Angeles Superior court last month, painted two conflicting portraits of Donald Sterling, saying he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but also a 'bigot' who was mean to others . Judge Richard Fruin Jr had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband. 'Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,' Nehoray said. 'Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.' In her testimony, Stiviano testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. 'We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,' she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified, painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and was now out to hurt him. Wife speaks: Shelly Sterling, estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald Sterling, and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell arrive at Los Angeles Superior Court last month. Mrs Sterling painted Stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts . Stiviano, seen here outside the court during last month's trial, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature . Stiviano never not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she quibbled with the sums at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her. The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: 'Who is the real Donald Sterling?' 'The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,' Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was 'kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.' She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. In her testimony, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand. Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano. The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress. Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel. Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection. The 32-year-old witness said she had worked for Sterling's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years, driving him to view real estate or attending Clippers meetings and games together. She said he provided money, but it was not regular income — and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her. But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement. She said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork. 'I know how he works his trickery,' she said. 'I knew something wasn't right.'"}

The BBC co-host appears to have already launched a new career - as a documentary maker of incredibly dull things. The 45-year-old, whose Top Gear future has been in doubt since Jeremy Clarkson's unceremonious sacking, has released his first home video on a new channel on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Bored: Richard Hammond has released a video documenting his 'bored' unemployed lifestyle - which has already been watched by 230,000 people . The film begins with a scene showing the 45-year-old lying on a wall shouting 'bored' to himself and his dog . It comes after James May, also in the Top Gear presenting trio, released a series of videos showcasing his jobless life. One included a cookery demonstration on how to make a shepherd's pie. But, if the title is anything to go by, it seems Hammond is still in need of a little bit of inspiration. Using the username 'Richard Hammond is bored', the presenter entitled the video 'Bored', before publishing an edited version  under the equally-inspired name of 'Bored 2'. Predictably, the description reads: 'This video is about bored'. The amusing but mind-numbing film - which lasts for ten minutes - begins with Hammond lying on top of a wall on his farm in Ross-on-Wye. He is seen shouting at the top of his voice - to no one except his dog - that he is 'Bored!' The slickly-edited video then follows Hammond as he drives along the M6 and country roads to Buttermere in the Lake District, Cumbria. The film follows Hammond as he takes his dog to Buttermere in the Lake District to learn how to herd sheep . Amid scenes of the National Park in all its springtime glory, the footage follows Hammond as he learns from local farmers about how to look after sheep. There are also scenes of Hammond feeding cows before having a pint with the farmers in the local pub, the Bridge Hotel. Hammond also takes time out of his farming duties to sit by a lake with his dog, pensively looking out across the water. But, unlike his Top Gear presenting style, Hammond rarely speaks during the film, sharing only a few key insights such as: 'It's raining' and 'What are we doing?' The film then ends with a cliff hanger which shows Hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm in Wales - but realising that he has left his beloved dog behind. It follows the former Top Gear co-host as he drives along the M6 listening to radio, with his dog in the car . It also shows him having a few drinks in the pub. Unlike his Top Gear presenting style, Hammond rarely speaks during the film, sharing only a few key insights such as: 'It's raining' and 'What are we doing?' Two hours after promoting his film via Twitter, Hammond thanked his fans for their comments - but said it had not abated his boredom. 'Many comments on my little Bored film. Was briefly interested. Then bored again. Shall make a cutdown version next. When I can be bothered,' he wrote. He later added: 'Have made cutdown version of Bored. Called it Bored 2 and put it on YouTube on 'Richard Hammond is bored'. Not so bored now.' Yesterday, Jeremy Clarkson - who was sacked from Top Gear last month - revealed that Hammond was spending his days trying to train his dog. He wrote: 'One of my friends, who shall remain nameless - save to say that his name begins with R and ends in ichard Hammond - decided to fill his enforced leave by training his dog. The film ends with a cliff hanger which shows Hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm - but realising his dog is missing . In an amusing end scene, the dog is scene sitting next to the lake, worryingly looking around for her owner . 'And now, after just a couple of weeks, he reports that the dog in question hates him and hides whenever he comes into the room.' Clarkson also reflected on the perils of being unemployed, saying he has to make everything 'last for hours' to fill the gaping chasm left by Top Gear. In his Sunday Times column, he wrote: 'We read often about people who live on benefits, and it fills us with rage that they are sitting about with a plasma television we bought, eating chocolate biscuits that aren't bloody well theirs. 'Yet after a couple of weeks in the same boat (well, all right, mine's more of a liner), I'm beginning to develop a bit of sympathy. Because what the hell do they do all day to stay sane?' Earlier this month, James May also took to YouTube to share his jobless life with friends. Richard Hammond shared his video with his followers on Twitter. It has already been watched more than 230,000 times . In a badly-lit video, the former BBC presenter gave a 'masterclass' in making a shepherd's pie. The cooking activity was originally selected by his Twitter followers, after he gave them a list of mundane scenarios which he should be filmed doing around the house. The cooking clip talked viewers through 'ingredients, prep and kit', 'cooking onions and chilli', 'browning meat, adding Indian spice' and 'not sure'. He had previously posted a video showing him tackling 'Greensleeves' on his recorder while struggling with a hangover – a popular piece that has thus far notched up over half-a-million views. Since Jeremy Clarkson was sacked over the infamous 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer, there has been mounting speculation over Hammond and May's positions at the BBC. Bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade the pair to continue with the show, in a bid to cling on to long-term fans. Since the unceremonious sacking of Jeremy Clarkson, there has been mounting speculation over Hammond and May's positions at the BBC . Although both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, they have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans . The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding."}

'It tortures because it's something that's always like – why me? Why our house? Why our Zayden?' a heartbroken Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. The culprit was 19-year-old Harley Hicks who bashed baby Zayden more than 30 times with a homemade baton during a senseless and unprovoked robbery, fuelled by ice and marijuana. Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar who broke into their Bendigo home at random in the middle of the night as the family slept . The culprit was 19-year-old Harley Hicks (pictured) who bashed baby Zayden more than 30 times with a homemade baton during a senseless and unprovoked robbery, fuelled by ice and marijuana . Heartbroken mother Casey Veal (pictured) has spoken out about her relentless grief after her baby son was brutally murdered in a random attack when a stranger broke into their home . 'My son was murdered so he could get a hit of ice. That's it,' Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. Hicks left the home with nothing more than a wallet and a pair of sunglasses. He unplugged the baby monitor before unleashing the vicious attack on the defenceless baby while Ms Veal and Zayden's brother Xavier, then aged three, slept. When Ms Veal woke she realised they'd been robbed. She was then faced with the horror of discovering the brutal attack on her son, leaving him almost beyond recognition. 'When I walked over to the cot, I pulled the blankets back and that's when I saw his face and there was blood everywhere underneath him,' she said tearfully. Zayden had been repeatedly bashed before he was stabbed 32 times with a homemade copper baton. The happy baby with a beautiful smile suffered a crushed skull, broken collar bone and a broken rib. He was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved.

'He was gone so I asked if I could have him, I just wanted to hold him,' she told 60 Minutes. 'I just sat and I cried. I just said 'I am so sorry.' 'I'm so sorry that I failed. My only job as your mum was to look after you and I didn't.' The new interview coincides with the federal government's announcement of the introduction of a task force to combat the 'national ice epidemic'. Assistant Health Minister Fiona Nash says the best way to reduce demand for ice is to educate the community, not just police its use. 'We can't arrest our way out of this problem,' she told ABC TV. The health and education campaign will warn Australians about the dangers of the drug. Its key message would be that a momentary high would lead to a lifetime of pain and suffering, Mr Abbott said. He declared the drug worse than heroin, LSD, cocaine or ecstasy. Justice Kaye said the murderer Hicks had at no point shown remorse.'Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby... or for his family' The baby was a victim of a random attack yet his mother Casey Veal (pictured) remains wracked with guilt . 'It's much more addictive, much more dangerous, much more damaging,' he told reporters in Sydney. Asked if the campaign would be as confronting as the infamous Grim Reaper AIDs ads of the 1980s, Senator . Nash said: 'We're going to do what's most effective.' The campaign will get underway 'well before' June 30, Mr Abbott later added. Ice is known for its intense comedowns and can make a person feel paranoid, hallucinate, aggressive and extremely violent. As for his motivation, Hicks has offered no explanation for why he committed the horrific act. The murder weapon, a homemade baton, was later discovered at Hick's home with his DNA on one end and Zayden's on the other.

Harley Hicks has been sentenced to life in prison with 32 years non parole for the brutal murder of baby Zayden Veal-Whitting. 'It is almost unthinkable that any human being could have carried out such a sickening crime that you have committed,' Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said in sentencing Hicks. 'What you did was totally and utterly evil.' Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery. 'If that constituted your motive for killing Zayden, then you murdered an innocent child so that you could escape the premises with the valuable items that you had stolen from it,' he said. 'On the other hand, if that was not your motive, then your murder of Zayden was simply an act of unmitigated evil committed by you for the sheer sake of it.'

'Any human being with even a shred of decency and humanity could only feel compassion, tenderness and protectiveness towards an infant in those circumstances.

Justice Kaye said Hicks, of North Bendigo, had shown no remorse. 'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse.

He felt besieged and intimidated. There was little evidence his hardline ‘austerity Britain’ policies were working. His nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy. In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure – and it was getting to him. ‘It’s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,’ George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. ‘I was saying, look, if people don’t like the plan or whatever, well, you know… so be it.’ The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn’t take any more? ‘I never personally felt, erm, low,’ he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. ‘But I’m not going to pretend it was easy. ‘The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children – it’s not an easy conversation to have.’ Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. ‘I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job – you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.’ He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas – quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. ‘It’s definitely moving in the right direction!’ he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat – a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances’s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a ‘normal’ family life. It did the opposite. ‘I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,’ Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. ‘I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I’m going out in the evening,’ he says cheerily. ‘I feel very lucky.’ Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne’s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government’s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne’s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his ‘hunkered down’ phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn’t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was ‘put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary’. ‘Well, he didn’t last long in that position!’ hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs’ expenses scandal which led to him being painfully ‘outed’ as gay. Osborne’s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne’s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed ‘very senior Tory’ told him: ‘You take care of the workers, we’ll take care of the bosses.’ Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? ‘No,’ the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren’t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? ‘The campaign is going as we wanted it to,’ he insists. Really? ‘Yes. We always thought it would be close.’ Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. ‘Only because he’s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,’ he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party’s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron’s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: ‘David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.’ It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. ‘I’m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, “Go and wreck all the good work we’ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.” Absolutely not!’ The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. ‘France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, “My God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.” Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. ‘All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for the many not the few… the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.’ A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors – and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? ‘I’m not a politician who spends my life thinking, “What if…?” and “What when…?” ’ Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour’s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. ‘I’m not rising to that!’ he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. ‘We’re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,’ he chuckles. ‘Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.’ With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne’s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don’t win Election gold on May 7."}

Now mentor Ricky Wilson, his fellow celebrity judges Rita Ora, Tom Jones and Will.i.am, and most of all bosses at the BBC will all have their fingers crossed for his success. Because it's not just a hit single Stevie needs, he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts. Scroll down for video . Can this year's The Voice UK champion Stevie McCrorie break the winners' curse? His mentor Ricky Wilson is confident Stevie could be just what the BBC needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . Leanne Mitchell, the first ever winner of The Voice UK, has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer. The very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show . Series one winner Leanne Mitchell, mentored to success in 2012 by Sir Tom Jones, blew everyone away with her version of Whitney Houston's I Would Run To You in the live final. But despite much excitement surrounding her first single, she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts. Then a year later came her album, a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions, which failed to chart in the top 100. Some, including The Script frontman and former Voice coach Danny O'Donoghue, believe Leanne didn't have the right work ethic. When asked last year about Leanne's flop, he said, 'I was told by Tom Jones, and by the label as well, that Leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star.' Leanne won the public vote in the final of The Voice UK's first ever series, but her debut single, a cover of Whitney Houston's I Would Run To You only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . Leanne Mitchell has now returned to her previous employment, singing for holiday campers at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk, after failing to make her mark on the music industry . After being dropped by her label Decca, Leanne is now working in the job she thought she'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk. The singer has defended her efforts, suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she'd finished writing her album. But can the same be said for series two winner, Andrea Begley? Former The Voice UK coach Danny O'Donoghue criticised Leanne Mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the BBC talent show, but has failed to make his own winning act, Andrea Begley, who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013,  into a household name either . Partially sighted Irish singer Andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor Leanne, but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal, she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other TV talent shows like Simon Cowell's The X Factor . The partially sighted singer from Pomeroy, Northern Ireland, now 29, won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow Irishman, Danny. She even commented on the failings of her predecessor Leanne, and said that she was determined to do things differently. 'Everybody is obviously aware that last year things didn't go maybe as well as they could've done, and I think lessons have been learned,' she told the Mirror, shortly after being crowned champ. Andrea's album, The Message, released in October 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts, but compare that to the success of most X Factor winners, and you soon understand the singer's disappointment . But while Andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal, her success hasn't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like The X Factor might bring. Her debut single, a cover of Evanescence's My Immortal, charted at number 30, while her follow up, Dancing In The Dark, originally by Bruce Springsteen, didn't make it any further than 113. Andrea's album, The Message, released in October 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts, but compare that to the success of most X Factor winners, and you soon understand the deflation in the Begley camp. Will.i.am won the third series of The Voice UK with Jermain Jackman, a young singer from Hackney, London . 2014 The Voice winner Jermain saw his debut single And I Am Telling You, a cover of the Broadway number made famous by Jennifer Hudson in musical Dreamgirls, chart at just number 75 . Hot on the heels of Andrea was Jermain Jackman, who won last year's series with coach Will.i.am. If a slow start killed Leanne Mitchell's chances, Jermain and Will had better kick this career into gear. The singer from Hackney in London, still just 20-years-old, saw his debut single And I Am Telling You, a cover of the Broadway number made famous by Jennifer Hudson in musical Dreamgirls, chart at number 75. Despite various public appearances, once with Mitch Winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter Amy Winehouse, Jermain's debut album this month has landed at number 42. Compared with X Factor's 2014 winner Ben Haenow, whose debut single landed the Christmas number one spot, Jermain's success has so far been what you could call limited.

Despite various public appearances, once with Mitch Winehouse (pictured centre) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter Amy Winehouse, Jermain's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . The glitter falls from the ceiling...but the real hard work is just beginning for Stevie McCrorie . So can Stevie McCrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of The Voice UK? His debut single will be Lost Stars, a cover of Adam Levine's hit from the film Begin Again, which was nominated for an Oscar this year. The Scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival T in The Park already. Stevie's coach Ricky Wilson, frontman of rock band Kaiser Chiefs, has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism. When asked if he's worried about the growing number of The Voice UK flops, he simply replied, 'Stevie hasn't won it before.' So now it's all eyes on you Stevie! No pressure... Though it's not always the winners who reap all the success (Steve Brookstein, case in point), the X Factor has produced far more chart successes than The Voice UK. Here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from Simon Cowell's ITV show: . One Direction They didn't win, in fact they came third, runners up next to Matt Cardle and Rebecca Ferguson in 2010, but Simon Cowell's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally, taken over the world with their legion of fans. Leona Lewis Despite having left Simon Cowell's label Sycon last year, Leona remains one of the show's biggest successes, having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win. JLS The runners-up of the 2009 series, JLS went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums, before splitting up in 2013. Olly Murs He came second to Joe McElderry in 2009, then went on to sell almost as many albums as JLS and co-present the X Factor's sister show Xtra Factor in ITV2 with Caroline Flack. Alexandra Burke After winning the 2009 series following her duet with Beyonce, Alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single Hallelujah. James Arthur Before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile Twitter rants, he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single Impossible after winning the 2012 series. Little Mix The first ever group to win the show in 2011, Little Mix have now beaten The Spice Girls' chart success in America and raked up an impressive 132million VEVO views. Rebecca Ferguson Though she came second to Matt Cardle in the 2010 series, Rebecca has just released her third album Lady Sings The Blues and has enjoyed steady chart success."}

New research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food. Scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old Neanderthal teeth found in El Sidron, Spain. Neanderthals (represented in the drawing above) may have been the world's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet, according to a new scientific paper . At first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self-medication, but now new findings have presented a different theory. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable. Neanderthals may have cooked stews in the skins of animals, according to some anthropologists. Animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks. This suggests that fat and meat had instead been cooked off the bones. A study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised Neanderthal remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley. However, there is no evidence that Neanderthals had any pots or pans to cook with. Instead Professor John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, believes that they used animal paunches and folded bark to make bags that they could boil their good in. A study of plaque found on Neanderthal teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley . They have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They say Neanderthals could also used herbs to improve their culinary creations in the same way. There is already evidence that they cooked their food and may even have created stews in the skins of animals. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Krief and her colleagues said: 'Data on Neanderthal behaviour suggest that their subsistence and technological strategies were complex.' Neanderthals have long been portrayed as a rather primitive form of human that died out as they were unable to compete with the more sophisticated modern humans that arrived in Europe and Asia from Africa. However, recent discoveries have shown that they may actually have had a complex culture - capable of making stone tools and even jewellery. Three years ago researchers at the University of Barcelona examined ten teeth from the remains of five Neanderthals found in El Sidron, northern Spain. In the dental plaque of one young adult they discovered three compounds that occur naturally in yarrow and camomile. Dr Karen Hardy and her team, who conducted that work, suggested that these plants had been used to help ward off illness or treat a diease. Yarrow for example has been used in the past to treat fever and to stem bleeding. However it was also a popular vegetable in the 17th century, while the leaves can also be dried and used as a herb. It is said to produce a pungent odour while having a slightly sweet and peppery taste that has been described as similar to spinach. Camomile was also a popular treatment for inflammation, hayfever and stomach problems, but is still used to today to flavour foods in top restaurants. Neither of the plants have much nutritional value but both convey strong flavours. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. New archaeological discoveries are expanding our knowledge of how Neanderthals lived in ways that could not have been imagined when their fossilised remains, like the skeleton above, were first found by archaeologists . Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has become well known for his subtle use of flavours that contrasts with his rather brutish approach in the kitchen, but it seems he could also have learned some tips from Neanderthals . Neanderthals, like the one shown above, may well have been the world's first gourmet chefs, findings suggest . They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief said that previous work has dismissed the idea that Neanderthals were eating herbs to flavour food based on the assumption that their tastes were very basic. However, she says that if chimpanzees use plants to flavour their food, then it is entirely possible that Neanderthals also used herbs and spices. Writing in Antiquity, the researchers said: 'The strong, bitter taste of the leaves may modify the flavour of the viscera, muscles, organs or water. 'In a French cookbook, a recipe proposes cooking a blanquette of veal with camomile. 'The bitter taste of the cooked plant does not necessarily disappear completely; camomile, for example, remains bitter when infused. 'The presence of cooked carbohydrates, esters, phenols, pyrene and florathene in calculus samples from El Sidron supports the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cooking plant food and perhaps smoking food, confirming that they were able to practice different food-processing techniques. 'It is suggested that, among other cooking methods, roasting, heating or even potentially boiling to make soup, stew or stock might have been used by Neanderthals. 'Such a variety of practices, combined with the fact that the samples from El Sidr´on reveal the presence of smoke-related compounds, show that Neanderthals were using food processing at least as complex as flavouring food with plant material.' Other recent discoveries are starting to reveal what culinary creatures the Neanderthals were. Camomile is well known as a herb that can produce some interesting flavours for dishes and was eaten by Neanderthals according to recent research on dental plaque that had hardened onto fossiled teeth . Yarrow is a hardy plant but its leaves can be used as a herb known for its sweet flavour and bitter aftertaste . Research presented at the Paleoanthropology Society Annual Meeting this week suggests they tended to eat horses, deer and bovids rather than larger game like mammoths. According to New Scientist, Geoff Smith, from the Monrepos Archaeological Research Centre in Germany, said they also seemed to have sucked out the fatty marrow from bones. There is also some evidence from Neanderthal sites in Gibralter that suggests they also liked nuts and wild olives. Analysis of fossilised Neanderthal faeces has also revealed that while they ate meat, they also had a 'significant intake of plants'. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said: 'This paper reminds us that the Neanderthals were complicated and sophisticated humans. 'While the data from dental calculus might be evidence for medicinal plants this new research highlights a number of alternative explanations; the most intriguing of which is the use of food flavourings. 'The comparison with chimps must be used carefully as they are a very different animal but the complex array of behaviours seen in world chimps gives us even more to marvel at when we think about what the Neanderthals were capable of.' Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. Eight talons found at a 130,000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world's first jewellery, and may have been worn as a necklace. The traditional image of Neanderthals as primitive creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence ."}

In Los Angeles there was a standing ovation when the original star, Julie Andrews, came on stage. However, one country was left baffled: Austria, where the movie was set and filmed. ‘We didn’t really know what was going on,’ said one Austrian I know. Each year, 300,000 people come to Salzburg to soak up the magic and visit the locations of the film – it’s the reason three-quarters of all tourists head to the city. The beautiful flower beds of at Mirabell Gardens in Salzburg that Sound of Music fans will recognise . Julie Andrews from the beloved film The Sound of Music, fans of which continue to flock to Salzburg . The first tours started shortly after the film opened, but now buses emblazoned with The Sound of Music circle the city, day in, day out. And the Austrians still don’t get it. You’ll be looking a long time in the Salzburg tourist shops before you find a Julie Andrews postcard for sale, let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric. There are some real advantages in this if you’re a fan of The Sound of Music. And I am. It means there’s nothing to stop me from splashing about in fountains while humming that I have confidence or juggling fruit in the markets (perhaps not a good idea). The Old Town, where much of the movie was shot, is too narrow for tour buses, and that fact – combined with the lack of tourist tat – means there’s nothing to break the spell as you slide into The Sound of Music mindset. Also happily for fans of the film, Salzburg is a pretty conservative sort of place, and doesn’t rush about embracing change. Half a century after shooting the movie, Julie Andrews could return to the city and wander round without too many shocks to the system (providing she overlooked the McDonald’s on Getreidegasse, sitting uncomfortably amid shops selling Austrian national dress). For me, Salzburg is the most hummable city ever – although the tunes you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city fathers. Lady Gaga paid tribute to the film, in the presence of its original star, for its 50 anniversary at the Oscars . Built into the mountains, in medieval times the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining – in fact, it still owns a lot of the surrounding land, and built the magnificent monasteries and convents that dominate the city. The real Maria von Trapp – played by Andrews in the film – actually did become a novice at Nonnberg, which was founded in the 8th Century. Head past here around 7pm and you’re still likely to hear the real-life nuns singing Gregorian chants. Bells peel at every opportunity and the mountains – well, it’s safe to say they haven’t changed much. On my first trip, more than 20 years ago, I stayed at an independent hostel, the Yoho (www.yoho.at) in Paracelsusstrasse, which I’m pleased to say is still going strong and still showing The Sound Of Music for free each night. Then it was a solitary outpost of Rodgers and Hammerstein-based enthusiasm, but now there are encouraging signs that the rest of Austria may just be starting to catch on. Sound of Music tourism began almost immediately after the film's release and is still going strong . My hotel for this trip, the rather more luxurious Castellani Parkhotel, shows the film on a continual loop on one of its TV channels. I could wake up to Climb Ev’ry Mountain and nod off to Sixteen Going On Seventeen. And I did. It was an ideal base for a Sound of Music weekend. The hotel even has its own wedding chapel – a gorgeous baroque concoction created during its days as an aristocratic mansion. It has to be said that breakfast doesn’t really feature in the film, which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel. And the best place to do so? Cafe Tomaselli, Salzburg’s oldest, dating from the 18th Century, right in the centre of the city in Alter Markt. The coffee is strong, served in multiple ways, while its strudel has spiced apple and crisp pastry, and is drenched in enough sugar to start an avalanche. Then it’s time to tick off a few of the key sights. First up, the Residenzplatz, just outside the cafe. In the movie it’s draped with Nazi flags. Cafe Tomaselli , Salzburg’s oldest, dates back to the 18th Century and is in the centre of the city in Alter Markt . Rumour has it that as the Second World War had ended just 20 years earlier, the city authorities weren’t keen on the flags, but the producers won them round by saying that the alternative was to use original footage of the German annexation of Austria in the film. Then there’s St Peter’s Cemetery – a series of catacombs that the movie’s set designers used as inspiration for the flight scenes – and the Felsenreitschule, the open-air theatre that was used for the concert scenes. Now it shows operas and concerts. As for the Salzach, the river that the city straddles, you cross it via the Mozart bridge, used by Maria and the children as they sang Do-Re-Mi. The Mirabell Gardens on the other side of the river allow an even fuller expression of appreciation for the film. Pat the head of the stone dwarf; jump up and down the steps; run about a lot! Many people do it and – even more hearteningly – post the results on YouTube. And all the time, Austrians are just enjoying walking in the gardens, completely oblivious, next to a palace built by an archbishop for his 15 children (particularly noteworthy in a Catholic country). Residenzplatz, just outside Cafe Tomaselli, was draped in Nazi flags in the 50-year-old film . But to really immerse yourself in the full experience, and to see the more outlying locations, you have to take a tour. I’ve taken a few in my time – I tend to feel them calling me each time I head to Salzburg, just as Maria felt the mountains calling her. Over the years I’ve been accompanied on them by groups ranging from unthrilled Austrians to up-for-it Australians in dirndls who had us singing the different parts of The Lonely Goatherd as we headed into the mountains. This time, however, I was accompanied by Gerry, an Austrian who’d actually seen the film, as well as Brits (loads), Americans, and a family from Malaysia. We headed to Hellbrunn, where the gazebo from Sixteen Going On Seventeen is now housed (and now locked after too many fans tried to leap from bench to bench and injured themselves). We also passed the house that served as the main location for the von Trapp family home. It’s now part of the Mozarteum Music Academy, and the easiest way to stay there is to become a top-flight musician. Sarah Turner found herself singing along to The Lonely Goatherd with up-for-it Australians in dirndls . We then started climbing our way into the mountains that feature in the opening shots – now augmented with nice chalets, as this area is a popular escape for posh Austrians and Germans – and gazed down at the town of Fuschl and its lake, one of Austria’s most famous views. British Airways offers return flights from Gatwick to Salzburg from £102. Rooms at the Castellani Parkhotel Salzburg start at £95. Tours with Panorama start at £29 per person. Finally, we arrived at Mondsee. This lakeside town provided the church used for the wedding. About 70 per cent of the people on the trip (there is an over-representation of women) took the chance to walk down the aisle. Needless to say, I was among them. I emerged, blinking, into the sunlight to enjoy cake shops and, amazingly, a shop selling film memorabilia. I felt thrilled. It seemed the whole world was now united in its love for this movie – even Austrians themselves. What’s more, the state theatre in Salzburg – the Landestheater – now even has a production of The Sound Of Music. It’s only taken 50 years. There’s just one thing to remember. Edelweiss is not the Austrian national anthem, whatever Ronald Reagan thought. He once arranged to have it played when the Austrian ambassador arrived at the White House."}

Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340. The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake . And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk . So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; ½ pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'"}

I preferred instead to be delighted - or otherwise - on arrival. I was travelling with my old mucker Doon Mackichan (from Smack The Pony, Plebs, The Day Today). Our paths first crossed almost 30 years ago as rookies on the comedy circuit, but since then we have, by chance, both acquired part-time homes in the same seaside town. It is Doon who has taught me to stride like a warrior into the freezing Channel. Luxury personified: The Datai Hotel has all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City, says Maria McErlane . Setting off for the Far East, there was something of the Hinge and Bracket about us, blithering away in actressy tones, trying to charm the Air Malaysia crew into granting us a cheeky upgrade. (Which failed.) But that was soon forgotten and the joy of leaving Britain behind in cold mid-December was fully realised when we disembarked into the densely tropical humidity of Langkawi. After a 30-minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests, The Datai appeared with all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City. Full-size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance, as beautiful silk sari-clad Malaysian staff welcomed us with cocktails. In the background, the ubiquitous lobby pianist/singer warbled away to I Just Called To Say I Love You. A minor note of tedium. Langkawi is an archipelago of 104 islands in the Andaman Sea, 20 miles off the coast of Malaysia. In 2007 it was given World Geopark status by Unesco. The Datai Hotel and Resort is in the north west of the island. Maria McErlane (left) with painter Doon Mackichan at The Datai hotel in Malaysia . This paradise in the middle of a ten million-year-old rainforest was created in 1990. Designed by Australian architect Kerry Hill around Datai Bay - a white sandy crescent beach voted one of the ten most beautiful in the world, with its magnificent backdrop of jungle and mountains - the resort took three years to complete. To minimise its impact on the jungle, Hill limited the size of the main building and added 40 villas over the extensive grounds, along with restaurants and a spa alongside a creek. He sourced wood, marble and stone from across the island and mainland Malaysia to create Mayan walls, Malay roofs and Japanese screens. The result sees soft, subtle colours creating an atmosphere throughout of calm tranquillity, offset by genuine animal sounds that could well come from a Now That's What I Call Jungle Noises Volume 1. Leaving the main building behind, we were taken by golf buggy down the 'yellow brick roads' through the enchanted forest, across bridges, and past waterfalls and freshwater streams to our elegant beach villa where we were met by our butlers. Keen to revive our weary bones, Doon asked if it was safe to swim. 'No,' came the answer. 'Why not?' she questioned, expecting to be told of danger. 'Because it is dark,' the butler replied with a smile. Spot of swimming anyone? The Andaman Ocean turns out to be the perfect choice for a dip at any time . Clearly he doesn't know Doon. She has been part of a team swimming the Channel in extreme conditions and also took part in the World Ice Swimming Championships in Finland ('you can feel your body slowing down as hypothermia begins to set in', she boasts). She is made of stern stuff. Despite it being close to midnight, we ran down to the beach, disrobing and squealing, before plunging into the silky-smooth Andaman sea. Phosphorescence streamed through the water, illuminating our limbs as we swam towards the lights of Thailand on the horizon. It was a magical beginning to our holiday. Back at our opulent Balinese-meets-New England villa, we were quite overcome by the super-sized beds, hot outdoor showers, plunge pool, Bose sound system, zillionthread soft cotton sheets, quietly whirring wooden fans, high-tech lighting (we longed for a light switch) and blackout blinds. Buggies can be summoned at a moment's notice, but the next morning we preferred a stroll on the beach, through the jungle, along wooden walkways and up the 139 Mayan temple-inspired steps to breakfast. Clutching our nature books, we were serenaded by squawking macaques and doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys swinging from Tarzan vines through the trees. First class display: The pair were serenaded by doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys in the trees . Brahminy kites and green imperial pigeons flew overhead, and we both leapt back in horror when a three foot long monitor lizard slithered across the path into the undergrowth. It really was a first-class display from the jungle inhabitants. After breakfast on the terrace, we took mountain bikes and cycled to the resort's golf course. Golf is not really my thing, but if you know your sand wedge from your nine iron, this course is fantastic - everything is groomed to within an inch of a Stepford wife. In fact, the Els Club Teluk Datai has been voted the best 'new' golf course in the world. Having ignored the warning to keep all doors and windows closed, Doon arrived back at the villa to find a scene of devastation: a monkey burglary. Every drawer had been wrenched open, newspapers shredded, jars unscrewed, suitcase contents scattered and chocolates eaten - tiny slivers of silver paper being the only remains of a Toblerone. Doon had painted a watercolour earlier that morning which the monkeys had 'relieved' themselves on. We didn't need a forensics team to identify our uninvited guests as chocolatey paw prints were everywhere. I was secretly rather thrilled with their ingenuity. After such excitement, a sea dip was needed before several Beach Club cocktails and much embellished recounting of 'Monkeygate'. The four restaurants at The Datai are overseen by executive chef Richard Millar. There's the Beach Club specialising in Mediterranean and international cuisine; The Gulai House, tucked into the forest and offering intensely flavoursome Malay and Indian offerings; the Dining Room in the main building; and The Pavilion, a restaurant on 100ft-high balau stilts erected with the help of elephants (yes, really). Doon remarked that it resembled a 'birds' nest in the sky', albeit one that serves traditional Thai cuisine. Such was our commitment to sampling all the restaurants, we both managed to gain half a stone in a week. Maria heads to the beach after a lazy breakfast . The most pleasing element of our beach view was the lack of visiting boats, save for the Naga Pelangi (Rainbow Dragon), a traditional wooden Malaysian junk schooner hand-built in the boatyards of Duyung island on the east coast of Malaysia. We were invited aboard for a trip to the Geopark to watch brown eagles feed and, in Doon's case, to find dolphins. Her chosen method to summon these creatures was to serenade them in full operatic mode with songs from Carmen - an impressive but futile exercise as they stayed away. If the many activities at The Datai become too much, gentler pursuits are on offer, such as an 8am nature walk that teaches participants the ways of the forest. For me, however, it was a bit early for concentration, so I excused myself and enjoyed a lazy breakfast. Later, in the bathroom, a bean bagsized frog fell from the air-con vent on to my head before hopping on to the cistern, blinking into the daylight: a reminder, were one needed, of the Herculean task it must be preventing the jungle from taking back its land. During our stay, in a futile attempt to counter the calorific intake, we swam morning, noon and night. One longer excursion across the tranquil Datai Bay with flippers and snorkels resulted in us being spiked by sea urchins and stung by jellyfish. Neither incident was a huge deal, but the Datai nurses were on hand within moments of us returning to land, and even took time to check on us the following day. Before leaving Datai, we squeezed in a trip to the spa, which is open to the jungle. I could see the creek below and hear the monkeys gossiping. The ubiquitous plinky-plonky spa musak was quickly redundant when the heavens open and the full rainforest orchestra began its symphony in earnest. During my 90-minute treatment - a Ramuan massage - I'm not sure I have ever been, nor will ever be again, in such a state of zen relaxation. The Datai was truly special. Mystical, spiritual, romantic, luxurious, life-affirming... and fattening. We can't wait to go back. Experience Travel Group (experiencetravelgroup.com, 020 3468 6268) offers seven nights' B&B at The Datai from £1,999 per person, including return flights from Heathrow and transfers."}

In a television interview the fugitive squirmed as he admitted only ‘evaluating’ the files stolen from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. The former US spy also acknowledged there had been a ‘f***-up’ when newspapers that were handed the classified material failed to redact sensitive details exposing operations against Al Qaeda. Scroll down for video . Last Week Tonight host John Oliver flew to Moscow to grill Edward Snowden about the leaking of 'harmful' documents and asks him to explain why he did it . But in an outburst of arrogance, Snowden said such potentially catastrophic blunders were a ‘fundamental’ price of liberty. The 31-year-old stunned the world in June 2013 – less than a month after the murder of Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists – when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents. He leaked information about attempts by spying agencies including GCHQ and the NSA to view citizens’ private information, claiming internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested. But security chiefs have warned that secret techniques, revealed by Snowden’s leaks to the Guardian newspaper, have made it easier for terrorists and organised criminals to avoid detection. Last month, Home Secretary Theresa May attacked the harm done by the traitor – now one of the world’s most wanted men. Terror experts said lives were being lost because he had hampered security service operations. They warned that extremists had altered their tactics after he leaked details from intelligence agencies – with fatal results. In Sunday night’s interview with British TV host John Oliver, for US channel HBO, Snowden pointedly avoided saying he had read every document he handed over to journalists. At one point the British comedian asks Snowden whether he had read all of the documents he sent to journalists. The whistleblower said he had an 'understanding' of their content . He would only say: ‘I’ve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive.’ Pressed, he added: ‘I do understand what I turned over.’ But he acknowledged ‘recognising the concern’ over whether he knew enough about the contents of the files or the abilities of reporters to protect classified details. Snowden admitted there had been a ‘f***-up’ with the way in which some of the information about the NSA and GCHQ, Britain’s intelligence agency, had been released. Last year, the New York Times published a slide containing the name of the NSA employee who prepared it. The target of the surveillance was also identified as Al Qaeda in Mosul, Iraq. Snowden said such details should have been removed and, in a feeble attempt to defend his actions, added: ‘In journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made. This is a fundamental concept of liberty.’ Unconvinced, Mr Oliver replied: ‘You’re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there … We’re not even talking about bad faith, we’re talking about incompetence.’ Oliver tries to get Snowden to explain the leak in the context of nude pictures. The ex-CIA systems administrator claims the government can see most of the pictures you share . It is one of the few occasions in which Snowden has been put on the spot over his treachery as he normally speaks only to Left-wing media who have published his leaks. Lord West, a former First Sea Lord and security minister, said: ‘Since the revelations of the traitor Snowden, terrorist groups have changed how they communicate and talk to each other. ‘His actions have made us all less safe. No doubt people will die who would not have died had he not been so irresponsible.’ Robin Simcox, of the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank, said: ‘This is exactly the danger that those who believe Snowden’s actions were hugely irresponsible – and potentially fatal – warned of. ‘This interview seemed to show how little Snowden had thought about the potentially deadly consequences. Snowden stole a huge amount of sensitive documents and as a result terrorists and other serious criminals have adapted their methods accordingly.’ Snowden handed an estimated 200,000 of the 1.7million stolen classified documents to journalists. In June 2013, he told the Guardian: ‘I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest.’ This is a transcript of Snowden’s interview: . John Oliver: How many of those documents have you actually read? Edward Snowden: I’ve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive. Oliver: You’ve read every single one? Snowden: I do understand what I turned over. 'These things happen': Edward Snowden, above, during his television interview . Oliver: There’s a difference between understanding what’s in the documents and reading what’s in the documents. Snowden: I recognize the concern. Oliver (cuts in sarcastically): Right, because when you’re handing over thousands of NSA documents, the last thing you want to do is read them. (laughter) Snowden: I think it’s fair to be concerned – did this person do enough, were they careful enough? Oliver (cuts in): Especially when you’re handling material like we know you’re handling. Snowden: In my defence I’m not handling anything any more. That’s been passed to the journalists and they’re using extraordinary security measures to make sure this is being reported in the most responsible way. Asking the Questions: John Oliver . Oliver: But those are journalists with a lower technical skill set than you. Snowden: That’s true but they do understand like you and I do just how important it is to get this right. Oliver: The New York Times took a slide, it didn’t redact it properly and in the end it was possible to see that something was being used in Mosul on Al Qaeda. Snowden: That is a problem. Oliver: Well, that’s a ****-up. Snowden: It is a ****-up and these things do happen in reporting. In journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made. This is a fundamental concept of liberty. Oliver: Right, but you have to own that then. You’re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there. Snowden: Yes, if people act in bad faith. Oliver (cuts in): We’re not even talking about bad faith, we’re talking about incompetence. Snowden: We are, but you will never be completely free from risk if you’re free. The only time you can be free from risk is when you’re in prison. He added: ‘There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn’t turn over, because harming people isn’t my goal.’ A report by the Henry Jackson Society last month revealed terror suspects were using human couriers instead of email and phones following the leaks by Snowden. Daily operations of British spies have been damaged, with Islamic State seizing on the information – making it harder to track down its operatives. Al Qaeda militants are known to have changed communication methods to avoid detection, and have produced a video advising fellow extremists on the matter. GCHQ has lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals because of the way Snowden exposed its operations. Officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs, paedophiles, human traffickers and money launderers. The agency has also been forced to tone down or abandon surveillance amid fears the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to fall off the radar. Mrs May told the Commons home affairs committee that the leaks ‘did cause damage’, adding: ‘It has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do.’ Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. He claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. A Guardian spokesman said the newspaper had ‘nothing to add’ in response to Snowden saying he had ‘evaluated’ the documents and whether this had put people at risk. How the Guardian changed headline to protect its favourite 'whistleblower' The Left-wing Guardian newspaper climbed into bed with Edward Snowden when he leaked the top-secret intelligence documents, publishing a string of damaging stories. And yesterday it was still giving the so-called whistleblower an easy ride when reporting on his clash with TV host John Oliver on his US show Last Week Tonight. The initial story on the Guardian website focused on the sensational revelation that Snowden had apparently not read all the documents. The headline stated: ‘Edward Snowden tells John Oliver he did not read all leaked NSA material.’ It added: ‘The whistleblower admits his actions carried dangers.’ But within hours it had toned down the headline so it focused less on his irresponsibility and incompetence. It was changed to: ‘John Oliver presses Edward Snowden on whether he read all leaked NSA material.’ The sub-heading was amended, to the softer: ‘HBO host posts uncomfortable questions to NSA whistleblower in interview in Moscow.’ A Guardian spokesman said the headline was changed because ‘an earlier version stated that Edward Snowden admitted he had not read all the NSA documents he leaked. In fact he did not answer that question’. The first Guardian website story                                         ..........and the later toned down version ."}

When award-winning BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant walked into a clinic one afternoon to have a yellow fever vaccine, he was warned the possible side-effects could be dizzy spells and a headache. Yet within 24 hours of having the jab, in April 2011, Malcolm had been reduced to a sweating, shivering wreck, gripped by a fever so strong it took two weeks and a spell in hospital before his temperature was brought down. Then the psychosis began. A shooting star, glimpsed from the balcony of his home, convinced Malcolm - who had no previous history of mental illness - that he was a modern-day Messiah. 'I went completely bonkers,' he says today. 'The vaccine fried my brain.' Malcolm, 59, who had the jab in preparation for an assignment in the Ivory Coast, believed his Kindle could fly, that dead friends were contacting him and that he could stop traffic just by thinking about it. He spent the next two years in and out of mental institutions, unable to work - and even attempted suicide. Fortunately, he has since made a full recovery. But Malcolm believes the yellow fever vaccine - available in High Street vaccination clinics, GP surgeries and even Boots - could have dangerous side-effects that affect more people than previously thought. Since its invention in 1951, more than 540 million doses of the vaccine have been given. Anyone travelling to parts of Africa or South America is advised to have it. Yellow fever is a serious viral infection spread by mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite and nausea. While many people recover after five or six days, 15 per cent enter a second, toxic phase, with recurring fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice due to liver damage. They may also start vomiting blood. This toxic phase is fatal in about 20 per cent of cases. Clearly a dangerous illness, there is no doubt vaccination can be life-saving. But Malcolm and others who say they have been adversely affected by the jab want the manufacturer to investigate. Malcolm, who for many years was the Beeb's man in Greece, had the jab in a clinic in Athens, where his family was living. Next morning, his new wife Trine, found him downstairs, shivering and sweating, his face beetroot red. 'I was beside myself with worry,' says Trine, 55, an author and journalist. 'It wasn't just the fever but the change in character. He became irrational, then emotional - crying.' When his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days, Trine took Malcolm to hospital. The doctors, who also discovered through blood tests that Malcolm had suffered recent liver damage, told him they believed he'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side-effects . They managed to lower his temperature. But his mental problems were only just beginning. Formerly agnostic, Malcolm became convinced he was Jesus, and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication. It was a harrowing time for Trine. 'One day I visited him in hospital and he stripped off his clothes and asked me to turn the sheet into a nappy and put it on him so everyone could see he was Jesus,' she says. 'Doctors had told me not to upset him, just to do what he asked, so I did it. It was heartbreaking.' After three weeks, Malcolm was discharged in May 2011, and seemed to be recovering, so went back to work. But within weeks he deteriorated again. Malcolm developed full-blown psychosis, and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the UK, Greece, and eventually with money running out, in Trine's native Copenhagen. On one occasion he attempted to take his own life. Happily, Malcolm was well enough to be discharged from hospital in July 2012 and has since made a full recovery. He is now pursuing the manufacturers of the vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, to admit liability for what happened to him. As Trine explains: 'Every doctor we dealt with said they thought he'd suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Since May 2011 I have been back to Sanofi Pasteur many times, but they are refusing to do anything or even meet us.' Malcolm is not the only person who believes they have had an adverse reaction to the drug. He is in touch with 12 others who believe they, too, have suffered grave side-effects. The NHS says that up to three in ten people who are immunised with the yellow fever vaccine suffer a mild headache, muscle aches, mild fever or soreness at the injection site - and that these symptoms occur because your immune system is trying to fight the small dose of yellow fever you have been injected with. These symptoms may last for up to 14 days after the injection. It's thought that far fewer people, four in a million, suffer more serious psychotic or neurological reactions, mainly unconnected to the symptoms of yellow fever itself. One of those is former Royal Naval Commander Graham Beard, who is convinced the jab, which he had in July 1999, ruined his health. He still suffers bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches (posed by model) A fortnight after being given the injection, Graham, now 56, experienced terrible pains down his left side. He spent three weeks in Watford General Hospital and another three in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queens Square, London. 'No diagnosis was made, except that I had suffered a major neurological illness,' says Graham, a father-of-two from Wales. After three months at home convalescing, Graham - who had also been unable to move - finally got movement back in his limbs and the pain disappeared. But then began a series of debilitating attacks which continue to this day. 'While now controlled by epilepsy medication, I still suffer bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches, which occur sometimes daily or with gaps of several days or weeks,' he says. 'The most I have ever had is 19 in a single day. The stress and exhaustion from these attacks essentially stopped my career. I managed to hang on for ten years, but by 2010, after 32 years in the Navy, I realised I wasn't being fair on the team. 'Having struggled to accommodate the condition, while taking a staggering succession of medications and having constant tests, it finally beat me and I had to walk away from the career I loved.' Graham always mentioned to specialists that his symptoms seemed to have begun after he had the yellow fever jab and, consequently, he has been advised by medical professionals it's likely that a vaccine caused the problem. But it was only after hearing about other cases such as Malcolm's that he decided to speak out. 'Surely the company that makes the vaccine has a moral duty to review it to see if it should be modified or replaced,' says Graham. As long ago as 2005, Dr Thomas Monath, a former Harvard public health professor and world expert on yellow fever, confirmed that the vaccine can cause 'really severe and significant adverse events'. He told Good Health: 'While we should not overlook the 60 years of wide use of yellow fever vaccine, with a remarkable record of safety and effective prevention of this terrible disease, rare and unusual adverse events temporally associated with vaccination may occur. Some of these, such as the neuropsychiatric syndromes described in Mr Brabant's case, may not be acknowledged as causally related in the official literature.' The manufacturer, however, does not believe it needs to reassess the vaccine. In 2013 Dr Ronald Neeleman, head of vaccination innovation at Sanofi Pasteur, admitted to a conference that the vaccine hadn't been reviewed in many years, saying it serves 'a small market, with very low returns, and there is not really an incentive to redevelop'. A spokesman told Good Health that the company takes reports of adverse events 'very seriously' and ensures they are investigated promptly, but 'after carefully examining all the medical information that has been disclosed to us up to April 2013, we have been unable to establish any evidence for a causal relationship between the administration of the yellow fever vaccine Stamaril and Mr Brabant's reported medical condition. 'The current state of scientific knowledge does not support that these reported symptoms could be biologically plausibly linked to the natural history of the disease, nor the mode of action of the vaccine. 'Similarly, the observation of an event after vaccination does not automatically mean that vaccination has caused this event.' Malcolm, who has written a book, Malcolm Is A Little Unwell, won't be satisfied until the experiences of people like him are acknowledged in official literature about the vaccine and he has been offered compensation. 'The vaccine almost destroyed me,' Malcolm says. 'I want justice for my family, and the hundreds of others whose lives have been ruined.'"}

Baltimore police officials, meanwhile, released the names of six officers who were involved in the arrest and the van transport of the 25-year-old and who've been suspended pending an investigation. But the developments were cold comfort to hundreds of residents who on Tuesday evening took to the streets of West Baltimore to protest the police force in Gray's name. Taking to the streets: Protestors again took to the streets of Baltimore on Tuesday to demonstrate against city police following the death of Freddie Gray, 25 .

The protesters rallied site of Gray's arrest and then marched to a police department a couple of blocks away, chanting and holding signs that read: 'Black Lives Matter' and 'No Justice, No Peace' - slogans that have come embody what demonstrators believe is widespread mistreatment of blacks by police. The crowd outside the Western District Police Station on Tuesday included 53-year-old Pricilla Jackson, carrying a sign reading, 'Convict Freddie's killers.' The sign lists the names of the six officers, who've been suspended with pay. The suspended officers were identified as: . Freddie Gray died Sunday after he 'had his spine 80 percent severed at his neck' during an arrest in Baltimore last Sunday . Also on Tuesday: City officials released the names of six cops who were involved in Gray's arrest. They've all been suspended with pay as the investigation continues .

Officers William Porter and Edward Nero and Garrett Miller, who all joined in 2012. Police on horseback were helping to control the crowd and at least one person was detained - an activist who jumped past police barriers - as protesters filled a street the length of a city block. Gray was taken into custody April 12 after police 'made eye contact' with him and another man in an area known for drug activity and the two started running, Baltimore police said. Gray was handcuffed and put in a transport van. At some point during his roughly 30-minute ride, the van was stopped and Gray's legs were shackled when an officer felt he was becoming 'irate,' police said. Protestors raise their fists and candles in solidarity on the streets of West Baltimore to protest the police force in Gray's name .

He was eventually rushed by ambulance to a hospital. Gray died Sunday - a week after his arrest - of what Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez described as 'a significant spinal injury.' Exactly how he was injured and what happened in the van is still not known. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said investigators are 'gathering information to determine whether any prosecutable civil rights violation occurred.' It's not uncommon for federal investigators to look into allegations of excessive police force. Justice Department investigations in the last year include probes into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri - a case that resulted in no charges against the officer - and an ongoing review of a police chokehold death of a New York City man. There's a high threshold for bringing federal civil rights charges against police officers in such cases. Federal investigators must show an officer willfully deprived a person of his or her civil rights by using more force than the law allows, a standard that's challenging in rapidly unfolding confrontations in which snap judgments are made.

Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (right, with Police Commissioner Anthony Batts) said that she is frustrated by the lack of answers given in the police report . In the Baltimore case, six police officers have been suspended with pay while local authorities also look into the death. The officers have been on the force anywhere from three years to 18 years. According to court documents, Officer Garrett Miller accused Gray of carrying a switchblade, which was discovered in Gray's pocket after he was stopped. The lawyer for Gray's family said he believes the police had no reason to stop him. 'They've made concessions on lack of probable cause,' attorney Billy Murphy said. 'Running while black is not probable cause. Felony running doesn't exist, and you can't arrest someone for looking you in the eye.' Kim Deachilla, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said a law firm that contracts with the union is representing them. The officers' specific roles in the arrest were not released by city officials. Bystander video of the arrest shows officers on bicycles, in patrol cars and outside the transport van. Batts said the reason for Gray's stop is 'a question we have to dig into.' Gray's death has prompted daily protests and a vigil was planned Tuesday evening at the spot where he was arrested. About 100 people had gathered around the start of the rally. Video shows Gray screaming out in pain as he is taken to the van. Spectators thought he had broken legs though police said an autopsy showed he did not . In a video of the arrest, it appears the officers dragged Gray to a police van while he screamed out in pain . Gray died on Sunday morning at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries . Harold Perry, 73, a retired small businessman who is nearly blind, said he heard the arrest through his bedroom window. A young man was screaming 'You're hurting me! Get your knee off my back,' Perry said. He said he also heard the young man say, 'I'm an asthmatic.' In the bystander video, Gray is screaming, but it's not clear what he is saying. Capt. Eric Kowalczyk, a department spokesman, said Batts met with all six officers involved in Gray's arrest on Monday. The Baltimore Sun first reported the meeting. At a news conference Monday, officials vowed transparency and pledged to hold those found responsible accountable. Batts said the investigation will be completed by May 1 and the results will be sent to the state attorney's office to determine whether criminal charges will be filed. Batts also said he is ordering that police review and rewrite 'effective immediately' its policies on moving prisoners and providing them with medical attention. News crews meet protesters holding up homemade signs with slogans such as 'Black lives matter' and 'Justice 4 Freddie' Citizens and groups including Justice League of NYC took to the streets Monday to protest following the death of Gray .

Curious passengers have burning questions every time they step foot on a plane – from whether pilots require a key to start a plane to where flight attendants sleep on long-haul flights. MailOnline Travel spoke to a number of experts to debunk some of the myths that exist and answer some of travellers’ frequently asked questions about planes. Scroll down for video . Once a pilot initiates the sequence to start a modern plane, the remaining steps are done automatically . How do pilots start a plane? It’s not as simple as turning a key or pushing a single button. Starting a plane is ‘a little more complicated’ than starting a car, said Captain Piers Applegarth, a representative of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA). The retired training captain said an air start motor rotates the jet engines before adding fuel and starting the ignition. He said: ‘This means that there are a few levers and buttons that need to be moved. On modern aircraft, most of this is done automatically once the start sequence is initiated but a pilot can still start it manually.’ Flight attendants eat the same meals that are provided to passengers if the airline bothers to feed them at all . Is the crew served the same food as passengers? If meals are provided by the airline, pilots do not eat the same reheated chicken or pasta dishes that are served to passengers in economy. To reduce the risk of food poisoning, the captain and co-pilot usually eat different meals, said Mr Applegarth. Like passengers, the flight crew can bring their own food on board, but the meals provided to them are the same or variations of the meals provided to passengers in business class. Caterers will sometimes load meals designated specifically for the crew, said Patrick Smith, a pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential. He said: ‘At my airline we are given a menu prior to departure and will write down our entree preferences – first choice, plus at least one alternate. ‘Eating in the cockpit can be messy, so on international flights I usually take my meals in the cabin, on my rest break. ‘With potential illness in mind, pilots are encouraged to eat different entrees, but this is not a hard and fast rule. In practice it comes to down to your preferences and what’s available.’ Flight attendant Sarah Steegar, who works for a major US airline, said if – ‘and that’s a big if’ – an airline provides food to cabin crew it will be the same food that is served to passengers. But it’s rare for some airlines to provide meals to flight attendants on flights under 12 hours, she added. ‘If there are meals left over we can have that. Many of us try to bring our own food, but it’s a challenge, considering periods of time with no refrigerators and different liquid restrictions and customs laws. ‘Fun fact: the UK is the most difficult when it comes to trying to bring food for ourselves.’ The Airbus A350 has private sleeping quarters for flight attendants on long-haul flights . Where do pilots and cabin crew sleep and go to the loo? Planes that fly long-haul routes which require more than two pilots usually contain private bunks for the flight crew, said Mr Applegarth. In other cases pilots try to catch some shut-eye in special rest seats allocated for them within or near the cockpit, or within the passenger cabin, he added. Mr Applegarth said: ‘Generally flights less than about 10 hours and 30 minutes only carry two pilots. For longer flights extra pilots are carried so that each pilot can have a chance to sleep and be rested for the landing.’ The Airbus A380, which is the world’s largest passenger airliner, has private sleeping quarters below its decks which flight attendants use for rest. Mr Smith said: ‘Flight attendants also work in shifts, and similarly to the pilots their rest quarters can either be a designated block of cabin seats or a separate room somewhere. ‘Many flight attendant rest quarters are located in the far aft of the plane, above or below the main deck, and can accommodate six or more cabin crew simultaneously.’ When nature calls, flight and cabin crew on most planes use the same toilets as passengers. The Boeing 747, the original jumbo jet, has a lavatory just for pilots. Prior to any flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty . What happens if a toilet’s tank fills up? The toilets cannot be emptied in the sky, so that means all of the human waste is stored on board until the plane lands and a ground crew empties the tanks. ‘If the toilet becomes full then it is out of action and the flight attendants block out the toilet so it can't be used,’ said Mr Applegarth. Prior to any long-haul flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty, Mr Smith added. He said: ‘It seldom happens, but if a particular lavatory tank fills or overflows en route, that lav will be closed off. It's extremely unusual for all of the lavs to become unusable – a serious situation that could result in the flight being diverted.’ Pilots monitor multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots about turbulence . Do commercial pilots communicate with other pilots during a flight? Mr Applegarth said pilots are always monitoring multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots who are in the air. He said: ‘We are always listening out on one frequency that air traffic are using and we use another radio tuned to a special frequency to listen out for aircraft which may have an emergency. ‘We also have a chat frequency that we can use to share information such as turbulence.’ The amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type, altitude, flight path and weather . How much jet fuel is required? A jet engine typically burns about 2,400 pounds (approximately 1,100 litres) of fuel per hour, with planes carrying a lot more fuel than required for the individual trip. Mr Applegarth said: ‘For a flight we load an amount of fuel that is the sum of the fuel needed to fly the route, an extra amount added for contingency – for instance, in case we have to hold – some extra fuel so that we could divert to another airfield and we also have to land with a minimum amount of fuel even if we used all the fuel just mentioned. ‘So after a flight we always have a minimum of fuel on board. On top of this, pilots can also decide to add extra fuel for each trip if they think it will be needed above and beyond that above.’ Mr Smith said the amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type, altitude, flight path and weather. A Boeing 767 on a flight from London to New York would burn about 75,000 pounds of jet fuel (34,020 litres), while a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380 might use twice that amount, he said. Condensation trails are similar to the fog that results when a person exhales on a cold day . Why do planes leave long white trails in the sky? These condensation trails form when humid exhaust from jet engines cools very quickly in colder and dryer air at higher altitudes. Mr Smith said: ‘It's not unlike the fog that results when you exhale on a cold day. In other words, contrails are clouds. ‘Water vapour, strange as it might seem, is a by-product of the combustion within jet engines, which is where the humidity comes from.’ 'Not even the world's strongest man would be able to open' a plane door in mid-air, said one expert . What would happen if a plane’s door suddenly opened mid-flight? This ranks among passengers’ biggest fears, but Mr Applegarth said it is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, for someone to open the door as the pressure inside the plane is much greater than the pressure outside. He said: ‘This means the door is being forced closed. Not even the world's strongest man would be able to open it.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In addition to any mechanical latching, most aircraft doors open inward before they open outward, and like a drain plug they are held in place by the forces of the pressurised cabin. ‘If a door were to open somehow the result would be a very quick decompression, though in all likelihood not a destructive or catastrophic one.’ Margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin, said pilot and author Patrick Smith . How much money does an airline pocket from each ticket sale? A recent Travelzoo study found that British Airways’ profit margin for each £690 ticket it sold for a flight from London to New York was just £4.24, accounting for 0.61 per cent of the overall cost. Almost the entire cost of the return flight went towards taxes, surcharges and operating costs. Mr Smith said budget airlines probably make nothing from their super-cheap promotional fares, and margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin. ‘Margins on a premium-class long-haul fare costing thousands of pounds, on the other hand, will be much higher,’ he said."}

Within their 'cool range', Hotsquash.com uses fabrics with CoolFresh technology woven through the seams, which is designed to work with your body temperature and keep you cool in the warm months. HotSquash.com has designed a range of stylish and practical clothes that claim to regulate your body temperature by keeping you warm when it's cool and cool when it's warm . The designer's say the technology used in their dresses and tops helps minimise clamminess with breathable fibres and wicks away moisture much quicker than wool or cotton. The larger surface area of the fibres in their garments apparently allows for faster evaporation by speeding moisture away from the skin to the surface of the fabric where it can evaporate quickly. Clothes designed for colder months, however, have ThinHeat fabrics built in for enhanced warmth. The makers claim that these fabrics keep you twice as warm as wool or cotton. 'Our fabric is inspired by nature, polar bears to be precise,' they say. 'Their fur has \"hollow\" hairs to keep them warm, we mirror this effect with engineered hollow-core fibres that trap air for greater insulation.'"}

In a 'peculiar' incident just one day before his death, the Oscar-winning actor, who had been diagnosed with Parkinson's, stuffed his collection of watches  into a sock and took it to a friend for safekeeping. The 63-year-old, who had also been prone to episodes of insomnia and anxiety prior to his death, also spent his final 24 hours frantically looking up drugs online, convinced he had another illness.

Feud: Mrs Schneider Williams, Williams' third wife, is in a battle with his three children from previous marriages – Zak, Zelda and Cody – over his £33million estate. Above, Mrs Schneider Williams with Williams and Zelda . The post-mortem examination later revealed that Williams had been suffering from Lewy body dementia - an undiagnosed illness would could have been the root cause of his bizarre behaviour. In tonight's episode of Autopsy, which will reconstruct the final hours of the actor's life, pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd explains how Williams' dementia probably triggered his paranoid tendencies. He says that Williams's insomnia and anxiety, as well as periods of confusion and impaired decision making, could also have been connected to the condition. But Dr Shepherd also tells the Channel 5 show - which has previously examined the unexpected deaths of Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley - that the actor may well have been aware of his undetected illness, something which could have exacerbated his paranoia in his final hours. He says that Williams's online activity suggested he knew 'there was something else wrong with him… something that he couldn't put his finger on'. Williams hanged himself in August 2014, a death which sent shockwaves through the celebrity world and led to an outpouring of grief from his worldwide fans. Tribute: Flowers and candles at the Oscar-winning actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The day before he hanged himself, Williams stuffed his watch collection into a sock and took it to a friend for safekeeping . Claims: Dr Richard Shepherd, a pathologist, pictured, told Britain's Channel 5 show Autopsy that Williams' online activity in the hours before his death suggested he knew 'there was something else wrong with him' His death was later ruled to have been suicide. The show reveals tonight how, on the day he died, Williams cleaned his bathroom of blood after cutting his wrists. According to the post-mortem report, Williams spent his last night at his Californian home with wife Susan Schneider. LBD is a common form of dementia - it affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States. The disease is caused by abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time . This leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function . The disease takes its name from Frederick H. Lewy - the neurologist who discovered the brain abnormalities  during the early 1900s . It shares symptoms with Parkinson's Disease - sufferers can experience motor control problems, such as hunched posture, rigid muscles and a shuffling walk . Those affected can suffer visual hallucinations, which generally take the form of phantom objects, people or animals  there . It is also linked to Alzheimer's disease as it is more common over the age of 65 and those affected often suffer from confusion and memory loss . Ms Schneider later described how her husband stuffed a number of his jewelled watches into a sock before driving to the house of a friend. Speaking about the incident on tonight's show, Dr Shepherd says: 'This is a very peculiar incident that his wife describes as typical of the increasing paranoia that he had been suffering.' Psychologist Anjula Mutanda also says the actor could have felt 'under threat'. 'Somebody experiencing paranoid feelings may fear that they are in danger and under threat,' she says. Whether it is physiological, physical or financial – harm could be coming their way.' After Williams's body was found, a bottle of quetiapine, a powerful drug used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was also found unopened in his bedroom. He had been prescribed it a week before his suicide, suggesting his symptoms may have changed prior to his death. In the months before his death, Williams had also checked into rehab to 'fine-tune and focus' on his commitment to staying clean. But the documentary concludes there were no signs that drink or drugs were exacerbating his depression when he died. Blood samples taken after his death showed he had not taken cocaine or alcohol in the last 24 hours of his life. There was also no sign of damage to his liver from previous drinking binges. The show also describes how toxicology reports showed Williams' moods were being controlled by mirtazapine, which is used to treat depressive disorders. Comedy: Williams did stand-up while acting in such films as Good Morning Vietnam and Mrs Doubtfire, pictured . Critical acclaim: The actor found fame with his portrayal of a kooky alien in the 1970s sitcom Mork and Mindy, left with Pam Dawber. He was awarded an Oscar for best supporting actor in Good Will Hunting in 1998, right . Good Morning Vietnam: Williams' played a DJ on Armed Forces Radio during the Vietnam War (pictured) There was also levodopa in his system, which is used to treat Parkinson's. The forthcoming documentary, part of the third series of the show, has already drawn criticism from Williams's fans after it emerged that it featured a 'graphic' reconstruction of the actor's suicide. A Channel 5 spokesman previously said the depiction was kept to 'an absolute minimum' but that its inclusion 'is important in telling the truth'. They added: 'The film celebrates Robin’s career and talent, and within that the tragic details of his death are part of that story.' French actor Alain Poudensan plays Williams in the reconstructed scenes. While Alain has worked as a Robin Williams impersonator for a number of years, he has also starred in many adult films, under the name Alain L'Yle. Williams found fame with his portrayal of a kooky alien in the 1970s sitcom Mork and Mindy. But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim. His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire. He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997. Mrs Schneider Williams, his third wife, is currently in a battle with his three children from previous marriages – Zak, Zelda and Cody – over his £33million estate. Zelda recently spoke out about her father's death. When asked why she believed her father took his own life, she said: 'I don't think there's a point. It's not important to ask.' In a statement released shortly after her husband's death, Susan Schneider said that Williams was struggling with depression, anxiety and the Parkinson's diagnosis when he died. Toxicology reports showed there was levodopa in his system, which is used to treat Parkinson's. The disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a small tremor in one hand. The disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Actor Michael J. Fox, a long-time friend of Williams, is well-known for his efforts to fund research into finding a cure. He was just 29 years old when he was diagnosed with the disease. Robin Williams with actor Michael J Fox, who was just 29 years old when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's . Stage one sees a patient experience mild symptoms that inconvenience day-to-day tasks, including the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs. Friends and family can generally detect changes in the patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions. In stage two, the patient's symptoms start to affect both limbs and both sides of the body. They usually encounter problems walking or maintaining balance, and the inability to complete normal physical tasks becomes more apparent. During stage three, the disease becomes more severe, with some patients losing the ability to walk straight or to stand and a noticeable slowing of physical movements. Stage four is accompanied by severe symptoms of Parkinson's. Walking may still occur, but it is often limited and rigidity and bradykinesia are often visible. During this stage, most patients are unable to complete day-to-day tasks, and usually cannot live on their own. The tremors or shakiness that take over during the earlier stages however, may lessen or become non-existent for unknown reasons during this time. In stage five, the final stage, Parkinson's disease usually takes over the patients physical movements leaving them unable to take care of themselves and generally unable to stand or walk. A patient at stage five usually requires constant one-on-one nursing care."}

Of course, a few celebrity endorsements and a business partner with a little black book packed with A-list contacts doesn't hurt. Kylie Gulliver, a former model and actress (with appearances on Neighbours, Offspring and Winners and Losers on her resume) from Melbourne had been toiling away at her small leather brand for three years, before a very modern encounter - via Instagram - changed her fortune. The 29-year-old's brand Elliott Label is suddenly the hit of Hollywood, and is adorning the backs of stars including Kourtney Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and pop group GRL. Scroll down for video . Elliott entourage: Melbourne brand 'Elliott Label' is hitting the big time in Hollywood with Drew Barrymore a fan . Power of the Kardashians: Kourtney (pictured above) wore an Elliott leather cap and  the brand sky-rocketed . The recent projection into the big time comes with the addition of Robin Antin - dancer, choreographer and founder of The Pussycat Dolls and GRL - as Kylie's business partner. Gulliver admits that since Antin has come on board the brand has sky rocketed from being a 'small solely-owned start up' to a complete lifestyle brand that's reaching a mass market across Australia, the US, UK, Norway and Israel. The two met in what is fast becoming the 21st century norm - through Instagram. Antin, 50, initially contacted Gulliver to request samples for her pop group, GRL, and the rest is history. Doll to duo: Robin Antin, founder of The Pussycat Dolls has now joined with Gulliver as partner to Elliott Label . Aussie A-Listers: Mimie Elashiry is one of the brands biggest supporters and currently models for the brand . Luxe leather: Mimie models on the label's website - pictured wearing the Leather Puffer Vest, US$999 (left), and Desert Leather Tank US$239 (right) 'When we  finally met up for the first time, we got along so well it felt like we'd known each other for years,' Gulliver told Daily Mail over the phone from Los Angeles. 'But it wasn't until I came over to visit her in to LA - we'd been throwing around the idea of launching a lingerie brand, but then I saw her insane jacket collection, and I said: \"screw the lingerie line, come in on Eliot label\".' According to Gulliver, it was one of the best decisions she could have made. 'My biggest regret originally was that I didn't start the label with someone, and so when Robin and I decided to work together I finally had someone to do the whole process with me'. And lend her little black book of Hollywood contacts too. Antin who counts Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz as close friends, and has a wide network of A-listers she has been able to give items from the collection to. Charlie's Angels: Robin Antin and Drew Barrymore became friends on the set of Charlie's Angels 2 . Close with Cameron: Robin Antin wears Elliott  puffer vest after dance class with Cameron Diaz . Friendship on film: Robin first struck up a friendship with Drew and Cameron when The Pussycat Dolls featured in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . At their recent Elliott Label launch in LA, Barrymore made a red carpet appearance to support the duo. According to Antin, the two share a long history together since early days when Barrymore first spotted The Pussycat Dolls and roped them into starring in Charlie's Angels 2. Barrymore's favourite pieces from their label are said to include the a leather blazer (the one seen worn by Antin at their launch) and a motorcycle vest with a hood. Smouldering: The Moto jacket from Elliott Label collection costs US$750 from the website . High-end: Biker Shorts cost $389, and the silk shirt is $289 . Thousand dollar pants: These leather Biker Pants cost $999 . Diaz, not one to miss out either, also received 'a big bag of goodies' from Antin, 'who took them over to her house and dumped on her couch' and was suitably delighted. The girls know the power of celebrity endorsements, and reveal that  the 2013 paparazzi shots of Kourtney Kardashian wearing a Elliott leather cap was a massive boost despite it happening 'organically.' As is the power of their stockists, such as 'Kyle,' one of the busiest boutiques in Beverly Hills which happens to be owned by Kyle Richards of 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' fame (she is also the aunt of Nicky and Paris Hilton). Eclectic resume: Kylie, 29, from Melbourne, was previously a model and actress, before starting her own label . Yet aside from the big name stars showing their support,  Antin also has a long history in clothing design, with a family history of seamstresses. In the early days of The Pussycat Dolls she would also make the original costumes by hand. 'When  Pussycat Dolls began, I made every costume. So when Kylie came to America and we went through my closet and I showed her everything I had re-done and tailored my way (even clothing by Yves Saint Laurent) it was the perfect marriage.' Of the brand itself, Gulliver says Elliott Label is bold, edgy and has attitude that comes with classic and timeless pieces for the every day girl. 'My aim is to steal a place in the market for well tailored, classic, quality material items at a good price point,' says Gulliver. She likens the label to  Rag and Bone and Alexander Wang -  but with an Australian influence. Gulliver reveals that Elliot Label was originally born out of a period of feeling 'lost' and lacking direction, and so the label became her new motivation. Lady in leather: Gulliver wearing Elliott Label at the Kyle boutique in Beverly Hills . Lost to leather label: Gulliver admits her inspiration for starting Elliott was after a 'lost' period in her life . 'For me it was a lifestyle choice starting the label, I was in a ‘place’ when I started it, I thought, you can talk about it or whinge about life or you can just do it,' says Gulliver. 'I wasn't enjoying what I was doing anymore and when I was  on a holiday in Indonesia  there was only so much tanning I could do then I noticed all the tannery places in Indonesia and that's when the idea came to me.' Now those restless, tanning days are long behind her, the question is how is she adapting to the non-stop business life of a business owner? 'It's stressful at times, the production side of things, language barriers et cetera, but while it's busy and hectic but I do have a work life balance and I'm doing something I love that is rewarding,' she says. Melbourne model to LA label: Kylie Gulliver has grown Elliott Label from small start-up to LA lifestyle brand . So what's next for the leather label? A vegan leather line is their newest addition, which, according to Antin, is already gaining massive 'street cred' amongst the fashion scene in LA. 'I've been walking around in the non leather puffer vest and people are like where did you get that? And I say, \"It's our line\". Then there's  a sport luxe line in collaboration with the pre-existing Pussycat Doll's label. 'We are in the developing stage of sport luxe line, Pussycat Dolls sport. So it will come under the PussyCat Dolls name, but under the Eliott umbrella with Pussycat dolls as inspiration for the collection,' says Antin. The Elliot Label 'Sport luxe' range is hoped to be out for the US summer, as The Pussycat Dolls Vegas shows begin soon and they plan to style the group for the show season. Fashion vs Fallon: Antin and Gulliver  rub shoulder with stars such as Jimmy Fallon (pictured middle) Gulliver has also started consulting as a social media guru for their new joint venture - social media advisory brand - 'Trendsetters.' 'Kylie comes from incredible social media background and we wouldn’t be able to do the business or have met if it wasn't through social media,' says Antin. It seems, the sky is the limit for the growing fashion designer duo, with Antin even hoping for a brand collaboration in the future - 'Look how Tom Ford got started - Kylie and I are just as talented, we have the business sense and creativity to do that, exciting for what future holds for designers and young brand.' As for the lingerie brand they originally planned to do? ‘Oh my god, yes we probably will!’ Right now we're focusing on Elliot Label, but Robin and I are crazy so we might turn around in six months and say it’s time for that lingerie line and we’ll do it,' says Gulliver."}

Protests began two weeks ago and six people have been killed, and dozens of foreign nationals have emptied their shops and fled over fears of attacks. Violence flared days after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said in remarks reported by local media that foreigners should leave South Africa. He has since said his comments were misinterpreted. Addressing parliament in Cape Town on Thursday, President Zuma reiterated his condemnation of the violence, calling it a 'violation' of South Africa's values.

The attacks violate all the values that South Africa embodies.' He also said the government was taking steps to secure its porous borders and making progress in setting up a Border Management Agency, announced last year and scheduled to be up and running in 2016. The ruling African National Congress party has condemned the attacks as 'shameful' and branded them 'criminal acts against vulnerable people'. In the past two weeks, shops and homes owned by Somalis, Ethiopians, Malawians and other immigrants in Durban and surrounding townships have been targeted, forcing families to flee to camps protected by armed guards.

In Primrose, near Germiston and about 15km out of Johannesburg, dozens of shops have been left empty and owners were seen transporting their wares on trucks today. And in Durban, where many of the attacks began, thousands of people have been seen marching through the streets calling for an end to the violence. Durban's impoverished townships have been at the heart of the recent clashes between locals and immigrants, following a similar spate of attacks on foreign-owned shops in Soweto, near Johannesburg, earlier this year.

Safe camps have been established in the coastal city of Durban for fleeing immigrants whose shops were looted and burned down. The fear felt by many was palpable as dozens of foreigners sought refuge at a police station outside Johannesburg and stayed there overnight, according to police spokesman, Col. Lungelo Dlamini. Patrick Gaspard, the US ambassador to South Africa who was born in Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Haitian parents, spoke in defence of the immigrants.

Jean Sharon Abbott, 38, from Plymouth, Minnesota, was told she had spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, when she was just four-years-old, she explained to The Mighty. But after three decades of suffering from muscle spasms, weakness, near immobility, as well as undergoing painful surgical procedures, she learned at the age of 33 that she actually had dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), a rare, yet treatable, muscle disorder. 'Honestly, I’ve never had any negative thoughts about what I went through,' Jean told Daily Mail Online of her misdiagnosis, which saw her confined to a bed for much of her childhood. Scroll down for video . Life-changing error: Jean Sharon Abbott can be seen recovering from surgery when she was 12-years-old. The 38-year-old has now discovered she was misdiagnosed with spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy . Different life: Jean, who is pictured with her husband (L) and by herself (R), used a mobility scooter before she was diagnosed as having dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), a rare, yet treatable, muscle disorder . While Jean admitted that there 'plenty of times' she wished she didn't have to deal with the physical symptoms associated with condition, including her dependence on others to complete everyday tasks, she noted that she still had a 'fantastic childhood' - thanks in large part to the unwavering support of her family and friends. 'Even though I had challenges, my parents were so good with dealing with my disability and didn’t “baby” me,' she explained. 'Also, I had true friendships that I never had to question. All of my life experiences made me who I am today - and I like me.' When Jean was first diagnosed with spastic diplegia, she was considered a textbook case, even though her MRIs and CAT scans didn’t show any typical symptoms of the disorder. And because her neurologist was considered one of the best in the field, second opinions never yielded any other conclusions. 'I had been seen by one of the best in the country, if not the world, and my parents even took me to the leading hospital in the US for a second opinion,' she recalled. 'They confirmed the spastic diplegia diagnosis and said that my doctor taught all of them.' Jean said she never questioned her original diagnosis and instead chose to accept her physical struggles and focus on living her life to the best of her ability. 'I was never one to dwell on my disability or to think about it too much, other than when I was at these doctor appointments,' she said. 'I guess I was too busy trying to live a normal life and having fun with my friends and family.' By the time she was 12-years-old, Jean underwent a 'very painful' muscle transfer to prevent her knees from knocking together when she walked. Miracle drug: Jean, who was once nearly immobile, completed a 10-mile hike with her husband (pictured) four months after she started taking her DRD medication known as L-Dopa . Happy family: Jean is pictured with her husband and their three children following her correct diagnosis of DRD . Although she compared the physical agony to open heart surgery, she said she was glad her parents encouraged her to have the procedure, which helped her a great deal and helped to prevent her from tripping over herself when she walked. Jean, who said she 'still can't get her knees to touch', noted that she was 'happy that it was a permanent procedure', although she would have done it again if needed. When she was in her late twenties, the mother-of-three had a pump implanted in her body to distribute medicine, but when she ended up over-medicated she visited a specialist who would eventually change her life forever. Jean's new doctor questioned her original diagnosis and sent her to another neurologist. Her new neurologist told her she had actually been living with DRD, noting that most of her symptoms would improve or disappear with a daily dose of a medication known as L-Dopa. The neurologist explained that the symptoms of DRD, including the involuntary muscle contractions and tremors, are often mistaken for cerebral palsy or other disorders. But Jean 'couldn't imagine having anything other than spastic diplegia' and confessed that she wasn't even going to fill the prescription until her husband persuaded to her to try it. 'When I began taking it, I was the biggest skeptic,' she said. 'I was expecting no results whatsoever and couldn’t imagine a life any other way.' Jean was given what she now knows to be her correct diagnosis on Good Friday in 2010 and just two days later, on Easter Sunday, she stood for the first time without assistance. New world: Jean can be seen using trekking poles during one of her hikes . True love: The happy couple posed for a photo when Jean still believed she had spastic diplegia . It soon became clear that the medication was working better than Jean could have ever imagined. As she got stronger, her husband began working with her to increase her walking distance and fourth months later, they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary by traveling the 1,200 mile road around Lake Superior - the location of their first honeymoon. And not only was Jean able to walk to the touristy locations that she previously had to be carried to, she was actually able to complete a 10-mile hike along with her husband. While Jean said that they took their time and had snacks along the way, she was amazed by her physical accomplishment. 'I was so proud of myself and thought that there are so many people in the world that physically can do stuff like this but choose not to,' she said. 'And I began to think of all the places I would love to travel with my family that wouldn’t have been an option before.' And while Jean realized that there are so many things she wants to try now that she can, she still insists that she doesn't have any regrets about receiving her diagnosis so late in life. As someone who believes that everything happens for a reason, she noted that if she hadn’t been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, she probably would have chosen a different college, meaning she never would have met her husband and had three children with him. 'All I know is, I’ve never been one to live with regrets and I wasn’t about to start that thought process as the result of a new diagnosis,' Jean explained. 'Plus, I can do things that I never would have even considered before, so I have no reason to be angry or upset. I’m just so darn happy!' Night out: Jean was wearing heels six months after she started taking L-Dopa to relieve her muscle spasms and tremors . I began to think of all the places I would love to travel with my family that wouldn’t have been an option before . Although L-Dopa has drastically changed her life, Jean still has to make sure that she gets plenty of sleep and remains as stress free as possible, or she can suffer from incredibly sore muscles and cramps, as well as issues with balance and tremors in her hands. 'I work really hard to make sure I get the rest I need and not put too much pressure on myself. And I exercise every day,' she said. 'But it’s still way better than the alternative.' She added: 'I’m so lucky to have this “miracle drug”. It has not only changed my life but the lives of my husband and kids.' Five years after her proper diagnosis, Jean has become an advocate for raising awareness for DRD, which is often misdiagnosed. And eight months ago, she decided to wean herself off of L-Dopa for a week so she could film herself walking, both on and off her medication, in order to help others recognize the symptoms of DRD. Jean posted the video to YouTube in September 2014 and has since received emails from people who said her video helped them recognize DRD in either themselves or their loved ones. She is also blogging about her journey on her website. 'I feel that my story is so important because I’m sure there must be others out there who too are misdiagnosed with [cerebral palsy],' she said. 'If this story helps just one person I will be thrilled.'"}

The newlyweds sat side by side praying during a section of the ceremony, and at one point, the Sultan was seen caressing the arms of his son's hand while the blessing of his new wife occurred. The Sultan has 12 children - five sons and seven daughters - from three different marriages. Prince Abdul Malik is the sixth child of the Sultan and his current wife, Queen Saleha, who wed in 1965. Part of the ceremony also saw royal guards entering the hall carrying ceremonial shields and spears. After the ceremony, there is expected to be a luxurious banquet in the palace's hall, which can accommodate up to 5,000 guests. The wedding is taking place over a period of 11 days, and started on Sunday, 5 April, with the royal marriage proposal ceremony. During this time, a representative of the groom approached the bride's family with the groom's intention of seeking the bride's hand in marriage. This signalled the beginning of the ceremonial events, and has been followed by a 'powdering' ceremony - when members of the families from both sides anoint the couple with powder and scented oil on the palms of their hand - and a gifting ceremony. Royal guards stood in large numbers in the Throne Hall, carrying ceremonial shields and spears . In attendance were also Ragad Kurdi Taib, wife of Sarawak's former Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud (pictured left), and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsen bin Abdul Aziz (pictured right) Friends and family, people of nobility and international dignitaries attended the ceremony, as the couple sat beneath in their gilded thrones . The Sultan of Brunei was seen caressing his son's hand while the blessing of the bride took place . The celebration will end on 15 April, with a ceremony of thanksgiving prayers. The location of the wedding, the dazzling Istana Nural Iman palace is situated in Brunei's capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. It is considered the largest residential palace in the world, with 1,788 rooms, five grand swimming pools, 257 bathrooms, and a 110-car garage.

The airplane, which spectacularly vanished last year with 239 people on board, is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast. By expanding the search area for the downed plane, the mission to recover it could go on for another 12 months, according to government officials. Scroll down for video . Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on-board . The expanded search will 'cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis', Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss. He made the announcement after meeting with Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai and Chinese transport minister Yang Chuantang on Thursday. 'We're confident we're searching in the right area,' Mr Truss told a press conference. 'I'm very confident that we have the best search equipment in the world and if the aircraft is in the area that we're looking, we will find it. 'The high resolution of the pictures that the ministers have been shown today gives us a high level of confidence that, if there is any piece of the aircraft that's within the range of these vehicles, they will pick it up and be able to identify it.' Mr Truss added all those involved in the search were determined to do everything possible 'to give answers to the families of the loves ones who've been lost'. The news came weeks after fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives reignited reports the plane could have crashed more than 5,000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (L), Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai (C) and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantan (R) shake hands after the MH370 joint press conference at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur . Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year. They believed they had identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, according to the Weekend Australian. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low,' Ahmed Shiyaam said. Mr Truss added that all those involved in the search were determined to do everything possible 'to give answers to the families of the loves ones who've been lost' The search zone for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will be doubled if nothing is found in the huge undersea area now being scanned for wreckage . Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . 'I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane.' Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing,' Mr Ibrahim said. The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The expanded search will 'cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis', Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss . 'I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, 'I saw this strange plane'. 'This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here.' Acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. A detailed map of the search was released by the Australian government . Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Curtin University Centre for Marine Science and Technology's Dr Alec Duncan began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. The crash was officially declared an accident by Malaysia civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman earlier this year. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' Mr Rahman said. It is more than one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events since the plane disappeared. 2014 . March 8 . The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 takes off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time bound for Beijing, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. The plane is last seen on military radar at 2.14am, heading west over the Strait of Malacca. Half an hour later the airline reveals to the public that it has lost contact with the plane. The plane was due to land at around 6.30am. March 10 . Vietnamese aircraft search for a plane door spotted in their waters but find nothing. A day later the hunt is widened to cover a 115-nautical mile radius involving 34 aircraft and 40 ships from several countries. March 13 . Malaysian authorities expand their search for the missing jet into the Andaman Sea and beyond after acknowledging it could have flown for several more hours after its last contact with the ground. March 15 . Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak says the missing airliner was deliberately diverted and continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with the ground. March 8 to April 24 . The search area covers the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Andaman Sea and the southern Indian Ocean. April 24 . The search and rescue phase becomes a search and recovery phase, with it moving a few days later to an underwater phase using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a bathymetry survey covering an area around 430 miles (692km) long and 50 miles (80km) wide. June 2014 . Australian authorities issue a preliminary report in which they theorise that MH370's crew became incapacitated, possibly due to oxygen starvation, with the plane continuing on autopilot. August 28 . Australia's deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, says the aircraft 'might have turned south a little earlier than we have previously expected'. September 19 . After a four-month lull, it is announced that the underwater search, involving depths of up to 3.7 miles (6km), would resume at the end of September. October 2014 . The new underwater search involves ships dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 330ft (100m) above the seabed to hunt for wreckage. The towfish are equipped with jet fuel sensors and can transmit data to those on board the vessels. 2015 . January . Senior Boeing 777 captain Simon Hardy suggests the missing aircraft's final resting place is in the Indian Ocean just outside the far south-western edge of the core search area. January 28 . Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) officially declares the incident 'an accident'. The DCA says it had concluded the aircraft exhausted its fuel 'over a defined area of the southern Indian Ocean'. The DCA adds that efforts to find the plane will continue. March 7 . Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, says data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. April 14 . Search area expanded by government officials in charge of the hunt for MH370."}

Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 - covering a total distance of 337.5 kilometres. His ‘Eight Great States’ campaign is driven by his passion to make a difference after the loss of his friend, Malachy Frawley who died from heart disease in 2013 when he was just 14 years old. Callum is preparing to battle vastly different weather conditions and diverse terrains as he pounds the pavement right around Australia, raising funds for not-for-profit organisation HeartKids Australia - supporting thousands of children living with heart defects. Callum posing like international running champion Usain Bolt at the finish line after the Canberra Times Marathon on April 12, with his little sister Josie and brother Henrik . Callum Ryan poses with his treasured friend Malachy Frawley, who sadly passed away when he was 14 . Malachy Frawley brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome . The University of Sydney student has committed himself to the incredible endeavour in memory of a Malachy, who brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. Callum is inspired by the incredible strength and resilience Malachy displayed as he faced the challenges of a Congenital Heart Disease, which severely affected his mobility. Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: kicking it all off with a 22 degree race in Hobart, sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta and freezing through an icy seven degree start in Canberra. With each race, Callum has improved on his previous time by at least ten minutes. This comes despite his muscle fatigue with the quick turnaround as he pushes his body to recover and do it all again! The worst is yet to come, as Callum is scheduled to run a marathon in Darwin and then summon the strength to run another in Perth just 14 days later - and another 21 days after that in Sydney. Despite Malachy being five years Callum's junior, they forged a truly special friendship . 'Finished first! (out of all the people running to raise money for HeartKids obviously)' Callum joked after he finishing the Wangaratta marathon in sweltering, 35 degree heat . Eight Great States: One man, eight marathons, eight states and territories, nine months, 337.56 kilometres . Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line. ‘At times during the race I thought “it’d be easier to stop now, no one would think any worse of you because a marathon is a tough thing to try”,' Callum said. ‘But I set out to do this. As I run, I sometimes think of Malachy and the thousands and thousands of other kids in that situation.' 'While I was running I thought about kids with Congenital Heart Disease and their families.' Callum is conscious of how lucky he is to be healthy and able to complete a marathon. Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line . Malachy was the beloved younger brother of Niamh, Imogen and Seamus, growing up in NSW's Nowra . HeartKids made incredible changes to Malachy's life (pictured with his father Dom and mother Maggie). They supplied him with a segway so he could be more mobile and have his own independence . Hobart was the perfect location for Callum to embark on his first ever marathon - an ideal 22 degrees . ‘Children with CHD struggle to walk around in their day to day lives because their bodies aren't equipped. ‘I had to stick to my challenge because they find that strength every day.’ ‘I disappeared into those types of thoughts and the kilometres fell away.’ ‘With the personal connection none of it feels like a chore or a risk.’ He hopes to make people aware of the plight of children with heart disease and the need to support the children and their families. Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them. ‘‘I first came across HeartKids through Malachy. I’d raised money for them before but I wanted to do something significant for Heartkids.’ Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them . When Malachy (left) was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum (right) had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground . Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley (second from left, with his siblings), a family friend five years his junior . ‘The most frightening thing about CHD is that there is no cure at the moment. If you’re born with it, then it’s with you for life. Lives are sadly cut short by it.’ Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley, a family friend five years his junior. When Malachy was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground. Despite Malachy being five years his junior, they forged a truly special friendship. ‘They had a very lovely friendship. They had the chance to get to know each other despite being five years apart,’ explained Malachy’s father, Dr Dom Frawley. ‘Lucky enough for Callum and Malachy they were paired up and their personalities really gelled. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 . Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: including sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta (r) and freezing through a seven degree start in Canberra (l) ‘Malachy looked up to Callum a lot as a mentor and Callum took that role seriously and invested a lot of time in Malachy. ‘They got the chance to discover they had a lot in common in the way they saw and thought about things, particularly in the way they were so creative.’ In his fourteen short years, Malachy left his mark on the world – creating, daydreaming and making people smile. Malachy has been remembered as ‘an author, film director, comedian, drummer, raconteur and HeartKids.’ He was adored for his ‘wit and loving nature.’ Malachy was affected by one of the most serious heart conditions, which greatly affected his mobility. Although Callum will be travelling to many marathons alone during his Eight States campaign, he travelled via Camry with his great mate Nick Peters to his third marathon in the ACT . Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s (third from left) commitment to making a change in the life of other children . He had needed to rely on others to drive or piggyback up from place to place, until HeartKids gifted him with a Segway. ‘The Segway completely transformed his life,’ said his father Dom. ‘He could suddenly get places without having to rely on people to carry him, which was quite a dramatic change from what he’d always been able to do.’ Their boy with a quick wit and limitless imagination now had the freedom of movement and increased independence, able to travel around his neighbourhood and to and from school. ‘I left the training a bit late before my first marathon, frankly. I felt really nervous before my first marathon, thinking “have I done enough?”’. Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s commitment to making a change in the life of other children. ‘We’re very gratified and we’re touched by it. Hopefully it will help a lot of people with the sickness to raise funds and awareness. ‘It’s great for him to have that awareness. Callum cares a lot about people.’ You can donate to Callum's Eight Great States campaign to help HeartKids here .

The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first – this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone – I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we’re going to change the narrative – the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won’t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won’t. Congress sure won’t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It’s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we’re going to define exactly what reform means – set a written standard – and it’s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk ‘reform’ but won’t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That’s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the ‘Honor Roll’ on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn’t listed there – it’s my own startup group:‘The Civilist Papers‘. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We’re not after money – we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

However, unlike most app developers, he learnt about technology not at MIT or at Stanford, but at San Quentin Correctional Facility. He is the first graduate of The Last Mile, the world’s only prison-based tech incubator. Unprecedented: This is Kenyatta Leal, the first graduate of San Quentin's tech program that teaches prisoners who have never experienced the internet how to code and build a business for when they are paroled . Leal was one of 15 prisoners who was selected from about 200 to undergo six months of intensive business training with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to develop their own business plan - while inside San Quentin. MC Hammer acted as one of his numerous mentors. Each prisoner that applies to the scheme must complete an application process, as they would for a job, explaining their history and their ambitions, plus one 'essay question' about their life. Leal was handed a life sentence in 1994 for his third strike, unlawfully possessing a firearm after committing a felony. He was locked up in the country’s oldest men’s prison, which has housed Charles Manson and Bobby Kennedy killer Sirhan Sirhan. But in 2011 he was handed a lifeline: programming. The business program teaches inmates about the internet, a phenomenon invented in the mid-90s after most of them were incarcerated. The aim is for each to develop a business idea to embark on after their release as most struggle to find work 'on the outside’. Now, after being paroled in 2013, Leal is lobbying investors to back the unprecedented method of criminal rehabilitation: teaching cons about technology. 'I’ve been very lucky,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I was completely lost when I was incarcerated. I didn’t know what I was doing. 'Then I started hearing about this thing called the internet. My family started visiting me with these things called smart phones, we would talk about 'the internet' inside. 'I was asking, \"What is 'tweeting'? What is a 'blog'? What is 'Google'?\" I wanted to know more.' The program was started in 2011 by venture capitalists Chris Redlitz and his wife Beverly Parenti, who were asked to perform a half-hour guest speech to prisoners.

The Morleys, from Casuarina on the north coast of NSW, released a video to explain Floyd's condition to their friends and family, in a bid to make their community a kinder place for their 'little legend'. Less than two years later, Floyd is now a big brother to three-week-old twins, and his mum Jade said that she knows the two newest additions to their family will be his biggest supporters. Scroll down for video . Jade and Ross Morley have welcomed twins into their family, making their son Floyd-Henry, who has Achondroplasia dwarfism, a big brother . Harrison Stone Morley and Cleo Téa Morley were born at 37 weeks on March 20, meaning the Morley household now has three children under 20 months- a fact which Jade said is 'crazy'. 'It was pretty unexpected. We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade told Daily Mail Australia. The twins were born on March 20 this year . The Morley's aren't strangers to unexpected news, finding out when Floyd was only five months old that he had a rare genetic condition which meant he didn't grow as quickly as other kids. 'When we had Floyd we thought he was just a normal, happy baby. At about four months we noticed that he had really chubby arms and legs and knew something wasn't right,' Jade said. 'Even when our pediatrician ordered x-rays, we still didn't think anything was wrong. But when they came back with his notes on them, mentioning characteristics like short legs and low muscle tone, I Googled them and dwarfism just jumped out at me from every page,' she said. 'The day the pediatrician called to tell us Floyd had Achondroplasia was the day that changed it all.' Jade said that she and her husband Ross were 'utterly devastated' by the diagnosis, especially because the only information she could find about Achondroplasia was quite negative. 'We couldn't find anything that told us that we would be fine, that this wasn't a death sentence and that we wouldn't be going through big surgeries,' she said. While the couple were still grappling with the news, they decided to tell a few of their close friends about Floyd's Achondroplasia.

Harrison Stone Morley and Cleo Téa Morley were born at 37 weeks . The twins are healthy and feeding well and are much loved by their big brother Floyd . 'When we told one of our friends, she gasped, she couldn't believe it.  I decided from that day I was going to educate my friends and family because I didn’t want them to be sorry for Floyd, we wanted to celebrate him and have them be happy for us,' Jade said. 'I said to my husband that it would be a nice idea do a celebratory video about Floyd and his diagnosis. I wanted to show that even though he would be a bit different that was it, I wanted to stop stares of the community because everyone would know him,' she said. The video was posted to Facebook and which explained how Jade and Ross met, fell in love, married, and had a 'beautiful baby boy'. The clip explains that Floyd-Henry was diagnosed with Achondroplasia, which means he will be 'a shorty- a little man, a little legend'. 'We were just going to send it out in an email to our friends and family, so it was pretty nervewracking just putting it out there. Some of our best friends didn't even know about Floyd and we just threw it up on the internet,' Jade said. The video quickly went viral, and was shared and liked around the world, as well as used by dwarfism awareness websites as inspirational. 'The response was beautiful, no one said they were sorry, everyone said 'how wonderful', which is exactly what he is,' Jade said. 'What's beautiful is that it's really doing it's job and educating our local community, which was the most important thing for me,' she said.

Every day in the street someone will come up to me and say 'This is Floyd', and they know who he is and we don’t have to explain that he is different.' Floyd is now a happy, healthy 20-month-old, who is very excited about having two new playmates around. 'He loves the twins, he's fascinated with them. Every morning when he wakes up he says 'mumma' and then points to the cot where the twins are sleeping,' Jade said. 'Floyd tries to talk to the 'bubbas' and pats them on the head. He's such a kind little boy which is all I care about,' she said. The twins don't carry the gene mutation that caused Floyd's mutation, and weren't genetically disposed as Floyd's condition was caused by a random rather than inherited syndrome. 'It happens in one in 40,000 babies, so they had just as much chance as getting it as anyone. We never even thought about it with them, and though we had scans right up until the birth because they were twins, we never even thought about testing them,' Jade said. Jade said that she and Ross are looking forward to their three kids being best friends, and to them loving each other well. 'I just hope they love each other and support each other. It's how I grew up, my brother and sisters are everything to me and I want that for my children,' she said.

'Cleo and Harry will be Floyd's biggest supporters, beside me and Ross.' 'Floyd is such a little dude, he is so cheeky and has the most beautiful soul. He is so funny and loves a bit of attention. We just can't get over his cuteness, he just stomps all over the house.' Jade said that Floyd is an intelligent little boy who has a big future ahead of him. 'Most of his demands come from his complications. He has low muscle tone which means he doesn't have as much ability as other kids,' she said. 'In two weeks he's having an operation to put in his gromits [hearing aids] which we're looking forward to because at the moment it would just sound to him like he's underwater.' The Morley's, who said they aren't very different from many other parents, are passionate about raising the profile of Achondroplasia in Australia. They use their tag line 'he's small, that's all' in their approach to life with Floyd, and are active in connecting with other parents with children who have differences. 'There are so many parents out there that are going through a similar experience, and I think that's why people relate to us,' Jade said. 'When you have a child that's a little different, you enter a world of really accepting and understanding parents,' she said.

Jade said that she feels that both she and Ross are better people because of their experience, and that they both 'just want to meet people who are different' all the more. 'We didn't know anything about Floyd's condition when he was diagnosed and I remember thinking that people aren't treating those with it very well,' she said. 'I remember very clearly one night deciding that if this is what he has, I was going to educate the entire world. His world is going to be a kind world and the only way that is going to happen is if we get something out there.' Jade said that what she is most passionate about is encouraging children who are curious about Floyd to come over and ask about his Achondroplasia. 'I would prefer a kid who is staring to be encouraged by their parents to come over and ask 'how come he is littler?' than just stare and have their parent tell them to stop looking, or shush them,' she said. 'I want to spark conversations and have kids talk about it. Then I can tell them that Floyd is just like you or me but small.'"}

The man's sarcastic response comes after Melbourne-based actor, Lucy Gransbury, wrote a two-page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night. Gransbury thought the good-humoured note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken again just before dawn the following Sunday. So she followed up by dropping a thank-you card and some gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who lived there because she was 'too scared' to knock on their door. But after a month of not hearing back from any of her boisterous neighbours, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with ' My dearest Lucy'. Scroll down for video . After weeks of not hearing back from any of the boisterous lads, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with this photo holding her two handwritten notes . Witehira said although others may find her crazy he thinks Gransbury is brave and creative . 'I'm impressed by the lengths you went to creatively to get your point across and even more by the audience it reached,' he said. He went onto apologise for the the' music festivals and comedy galas' and added that the deaf man and those buried in the cemetery 4kms away, that Gransbury had referred to, awake occasionally. 'There's probably people out there that think your crazy for what you done but not me I thought you were brave and I respect you for it,' he went on to say. He then took up Gransbury's offer of getting to know each other over a few drinks. 'We look forward to getting to know you also and about that G&T you mentioned let's do it.' But he saved the most hilarious comment for the end. ‪'P.S We have a room for rent if you know anyone interested. P.P.S I'm deadly serious.' Lucy Gransbury dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours because she was too scared to knock on their door after they had been quiet for an entire week . The good-humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence . Although a week after her first letter the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home, and again at 6.45am when their mates left, Gransbury decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly-reformed dudes, who she fears could crush her 'between their shoulder blades' as 'they seem to be a gang', deserved to be rewarded. The note, which was posted on her blog and on the Mamamia site, began with thanking the less-noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on Sunday she was grateful there wasn't the 'bass guitar song' interrupting her dreams about Prince Harry. 'You probably think I'm a bit weird and have too much spare time, and you are entirely correct.' The gifts included: . A burnt DVD of the pilot episode of Neighbours where Max Ramsay breaks up a party on his namesake street by 'yelling at the flamin' lot of them'. She then later reveals that the DVD is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on YouTube. Two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more effective communciation device. And in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party. Last but certainly not least - Gransbury threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours. She signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence. One of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party . After she was woken by their voices on Sunday morning, she wrote pros and cons about the incident - Derpa is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling 'derpa\" Gransbury took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics. She posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website. 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'. 'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with. Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways . The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief . Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. Adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for 'breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants.' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. She expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human, brain damaged or simply a moron. The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . As the considerate neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.' Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time. The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'.

In a leaked memo from the firm's Angela Ahrendts, the retail chief said that customers won't be able to buy an Apple Watch in store 'through the month of May' due to 'high global interest combined with our initial supply.' It was expected to launch on 24 April. Ms Ahrendts added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets 'closer to in-store availability.' Scroll down for video . In a leaked memo from Apple's Angela Ahrendts the retail chief wrote: 'Due to high global interest combined with our initial supply, we are only taking orders online right now [and] we expect this to continue through the month of May.' It was expected to launch on 24 April . The memo was seen by Rhiannon Williams at The Telegraph. Pre-orders of the watch began on Friday at 12.01am PDT (8.01am BST) and within an hour many models in various regions had sold out including the most expensive 38mm gold Edition version in the US and Canada. Models were showing a shipping time of four to six weeks or, in some cases, June despite the watch going on general sale on 24 April. An estimated 957,000 American shoppers ordered Apple Watches on Friday. That estimate comes from Slice Intelligence, which measures digital commerce by tracking consumer e-receipts. Its data from online shoppers showed an average of 1.3 watches bought per customer, with $503.83 (£337) spent per item - although Apple has not officially confirmed any sales figures. In a recent Goldman Sachs survey, more than 10 per cent of iPhone owners say they will buy an Apple Watch, a new survey has found. Goldmach Sachs surveyed 1,000 people, and found 11% of people who own an iPhone are 'very likely' to buy the $349 smart timepiece this year. It said the demand for the Watch was 'encouraging', and says sales are likely to hit hit traditional watch firms. It was initially believed that those who were willing to queue on 24 April would be able to buy the Watch before people who had pre-ordered. But Ms Ahrendts memo has confirmed otherwise. 'It's important to remember that Apple Watch is not just a new product but an entirely new category for us,' the memo continued. 'There's never been anything quite like it.  That's why, for the first time, we are previewing a new product in our stores before it has started shipping. 'Given the high interest and initial supply at launch, we will be able to get customers the model they want earlier and faster by taking orders online.' She added that this isn't the way Apple intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves 'those blockbuster Apple product launch days', but told store employees to be prepared for the changes. On Friday many buyers reported Apple's site was still down after the launch time, forcing them to order the device through the Apple App Store on their phones or tablets. As part of the first wave of pre-orders, the Watch can be bought online by people in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia, Hong Kong, China and Japan. The Watch also went on display in Apple stores across these regions, as well as in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple resellers in Japan and China. Online pre-orders began on Friday at 12.01am PDT (8am BST) and although Apple said the devices will ship on 24 April within just an hour this had been pushed back to June. Buyers also reported the site was still down after the launch time, forcing them to order the device through the Apple App Store app . Ms Ahrendts added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets 'closer to in-store availability.' It was initially thought those who were willing to queue on 24 April would get the Watch in stores before people who had pre-ordered. But Ms Ahrendts' memo has confirmed otherwise . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Mark Prigg in New York . As with all Apple launches, the Californian tech giant took its store offline hours before the pre-order time to update its product pages. However, shortly after the pre-orders opened customers took to Twitter to complain the site was still down and they couldn't access the checkout. One said: 'Irritated that I stayed up until 3AM to pre-order an #AppleWatch and the site was down until after the May inventory already sold out.' And even after orders had been placed, some customers had trouble receiving confirmation details and delivery dates. One Twitter user wrote: '#AppleWatch ordered but no email confirmation and the 'orders' section on their site and app is down so I can't confirm it went through.' Another wrote: 'No way in hell am I preordering an #AppleWatch today when it won't ship until June.' and another added: 'There's an #AppleWatch for everyone.' Unless you want it before June.' But for people who want to try on the Watch they can book an appointment online. A MailOnline investigation earlier this week revealed that the UK is the most expensive place in the world to buy the majority of Apple Watch models. Apple's site and app still say the Watch is available from 24 April, but when a model is selected and added to the customer's online basket (pictured), this changes. A Sport model currently has a dispatch time of four to six weeks, while the Edition model has a June delivery date . And for people who want to try on the Watch  they can book an appointment online (pictured). The memo added this isn't the way Apple intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves 'those blockbuster Apple product launch days' but told store employees to prepare for the change . The most expensive Edition model costs up to £2,500 more in the UK compared to elsewhere in the world, while at the lower end of the scale British buyers pay up to £63 more for the Sport model. The cheapest model is the 38mm Sport version and costs £299 in the UK. In the US, the same model costs $349, but this doesn't include sales tax. Sales tax in the US depends on the region where the product is sold, but as an example California has one of the highest rates - at 9% - while Montana has zero. All prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region. Prices also include all relevant sales taxes. Beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in GBP. In the US, California was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9%, while Montana was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it doesn't have a sales tax. Quebec in Canada has one of the highest sales taxes at 15%, while Alberta has one of the lowest at 5%. Prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing. With both of these sales taxes added to the price of the Sports model in the US, the total cost works out at $380.41 (£257) and $349 (£236) in the respective states. This is a difference of £42 when bought in California, compared to the UK, and £63 when compared to Montana. The effect is magnified for the top-of-the-range Edition version, which costs from £8,000 for the 38mm model in Britain, compared to a starting price of $10,000 in the US. At the time of writing, $10,000 converts to £6,769 - which equates to a difference of £1,231 before charges are taken into account. The most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the UK is £13,500 in the UK, and $17,000 in the US. When sales taxes are added to the US model, the price rises to $18,530 in California, which converts to £12,543 - a difference of £957."}

He added: ‘You have also been convicted of no less than nine trafficking offences in relation to under-age girls who you were deliberately plying with vodka so that you could take advantage of them, knowing they craved vodka so you could exploit them sexually. The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. ‘You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.’ The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their ‘friend and helper’. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being ‘plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends’. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then ‘rewarded’ with £5, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a £40 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would ‘choose her over everyone else’, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: ‘Age doesn't matter.’ Khubaib allegedly offered another girl £60, telling her: ‘You make me happy, I'll give you money.’ Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to £90. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: ‘What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.’ The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: ‘I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.’ He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and ‘I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved’. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: ‘We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.’ A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then ‘hooked’ with alcohol in an attempt to make them ‘compliant’ to sexual advances . A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter ‘kick-started’ the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial ‘worse than she expected’ after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: ‘We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying \"I'm stupid, I'm silly\". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. ‘Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. ‘There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.’ The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a ‘big impact’ on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: ‘After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'"}

But if you thought they rolled out of bed and picked up the first thing in their wardrobe, you're mistaken. The A-listers have tried-and-tested techniques when it comes to getting dressed and they all follow simple styling hacks to flatter their figure. FEMAIL has pulled together the simple but effective celebrity-favoured styling tips you can employ to make the most of your figure. Scroll down for video . The A-listers have tried-and-tested techniques when it comes to getting dressed and they all follow simple styling hacks to flatter their figure . COMBINE NAVY AND BLACK . The fash-pack have long championed head-to-toe black, but they're shaking it up for spring by injecting another colour into their wardrobes. Navy rocked the runways, from Calvin Klein to The Row, and the likes of Victoria Beckham and Rita Ora can't get enough of it. As our favourite stars prove, combining trusty black with elegant navy is both chic and flattering. Victoria Beckham, left, out and about in New York and, right, at a news conference at the U.N. headquarters, proves that navy and black is not only the season's hottest colour combination but also super flattering . Plus, everyone looks good in navy because it suits every type of skin tone. Because it's slightly less severe than black - yet  equally sophisticated - it puts an updated spin on a classic. Global style icon, the Duchess of Cambridge, is rarely spotted in dresses that don't come in her favourite dark navy and black - both of which she has worn almost without exception for evening appearances since announcing her pregnancy in September. Already a fan of inky day wear, since giving birth to Prince George in July 2013, black and navy have become an increasingly important part of her evening wardrobe. Over the past year, Kate opted for a £2,145 bespoke Jenny Packham dress - complete with a glittering crystal fern - for a reception on her final night in New Zealand. She also won style plaudits when she teamed a black Hobbs top with a blue Jenny Packham skirt. Alicia Kite and business partner and stylist Kay Davidson mused: 'A darker colour will always make you look slimmer and the combination of navy and black together is a great way of camouflaging a few pounds without dressing head to toe in black.' The Duchess of Cambridge is rarely spotted in dresses that don't come in her favourite dark navy and black these days and she proves the power of the colour combination, left, in a navy Jenny Packham gown for St Andrew's 600th Anniversary Ball in New York and, right, Hobbs and Jenny Packham for a reception earlier this year . CONTRAST PANELLING . Make like Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne and opt for dresses with cut-out designs in sheer fabrics. The use of side panel creates an hourglass shape and gives the illusion of a thinner waist, more shapely figure, as well as hiding imperfections. 'There are plenty of dresses on the market that use the illusion of contrasting panelling down the sides of your hips and thighs,' says Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com. 'This creates a thinner illusion and can also be used around the waist to cinch you in and give the illusion of an hourglass figure, which waif-like Kate Moss showcases to perfection.' The use of side panels, as seen on (L-R) Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Yasmin Le Bon, creates an hourglass shape and gives the illusion of a thinner waist, more shapely figure and hides imperfections . As well as using sheer panels to accentuate your waist, you can also make like Kate Moss and use them to elongate your legs . GO HIGH-WAISTED . They're the hottest shape of the summer and trendsetters Amal Clooney and Chrissy Teigen are already trialling the look - and you should be rocking high-waisted trousers, too. Contrary to popular belief, high-waisted trousers can flatter every figure. Whether you're looking to jump on the season's trends with high-waisted jeans or you're a mature woman looking to hide your tummy, the style can work wonders for you. If you're plus-size, opt for flared versions to flatter, if you're petite, team the style with sky-scraper heels to elongate your legs. The one universal golden rule for pulling off the look is sticking to a simple top - avoid jumpers and bulky styles, which will draw attention to your waist for the wrong reasons. Contrary to popular belief, high-waisted trousers can flatter every figure. Whether you're pear-shaped like Kim Kardashian, left, or have a more boyish shape like Pixie Lott, right,  the style can work for you . GO CHROMATIC . One of the most simple ways to look chic is by sticking to one colour palette - and the more neutral, the better, notes ELLE magazine. Kim Kardashian is a star who adheres to this - and pulls it off with aplomb. The A-lister loves neutral tones - such as peach and cream - which flatter her Armenian skintone. Other hues to look for when constructing an outfit include nude, grey, navy and black, which are understated yet chic. One of the most simple ways to look chic is by sticking to one colour palette, such as a peach hue like Kim Kardashian, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right . BELT IT UP . Accessoring with a belt is both practical and stylish and a simple belt can totally modify your outfit. Wearing your belt around your waist (just below your bust) will create a feminine hourglass silhouette. Use a belt to cinch a chunky knit, a slouchy T-shirt, a billowing blouse, a sundress (a la Gigi Hadid) or even over your coat or blazer for a more tailored look. Another simple and flattering ways to accessorise your outfit is via a nude heel. The miracle worker instantly creates longer, more toned legs and - as the Duchess of Cambridge proves - can pull together any outfit. Kite and Davidson concur. 'Ladies, if you don’t own a pair, this has to be your purchase this season. 'They will make your legs look longer and slimmer, however it's not enough to only think about the shade because you also need to consider the style. The chunkier the shoe, the more likely it is that it will add weight to your leg so we recommend investing in a nude shoe that has enough attitude to reflect your personality but is also elegant enough to be a classic.' Accessoring with a belt is both a practical and stylish way to flatter your figure - just ask Gigi Hadid, left, and style icon Olivia Palermo, right . Another simple and flattering ways to accessorise your outfit is via a nude heel, which, as the Duchess of Cambridge proves, can pull together any outfit . GO LONG . Duster coats and lightweight styles that just graze the floor are perfect for spring dressing. Rihanna, Victoria Beckham, Miranda Kerr and Kim Kardashian are all huge fans of floor-sweeping coats, which help elongate the figure by tricking the eye into seeing a longer, leaner silhouette. Team the garment with  jeans (skinny or boyfriend styles work well) and vertiginous heels. Rihanna is a huge fan of floor-sweeping coats, which help elongate the figure by tricking the eye into seeing a longer, leaner silhouette . DRESS FOR YOUR SHAPE . Whilst all of these styling hacks can work wonders, it's always important to dress for your shape, advises Lydia Jones. 'Everyone has different body shapes, whether it's hourglass or pear-shaped, and it's always important to know what suits your body shape and how to dress yourself to accentuate your best assets. 'For an hourglass figure, accentuating the waistline is great for creating the illusion of a bigger bust and smaller waist. Using a waist belt with a dress is an easy option for this, whilst high-waisted trousers and skirts are also great for highlighting the waist. 'If you're slightly pear shaped, an A-line midi skirt or floaty long length maxi skirt is great for creating a more balanced illusion and also drawing more attention to your top area.' Alicia Kite and business partner and stylist Kay Davidson share their fail safe tips... • Never underestimate what a well-fitting bra can do for your shape. It will lengthen your torso making you appear taller and definitely make you look slimmer too. • The fit of your clothing is crucial to flattering your body shape and enhancing your style. Your clothes should follow your curves to show you are a woman but not be so tight that it leaves nothing to the imagination! • If you wear a looser top, pair with a narrower bottom as this will always make you look slimmer. • Wear a bracelet or a cuff to help elongate and flatter your arms. This will draw the eye away from the top of your arms - an area that most of us girls hate. • Wear a long scarf simply draped and worn loose to disguise any muffins. This tip is especially useful when you sit down."}

With childhood obesity on the rise in the UK, these new figures are incredibly alarming. For more than two decades, I've been in the business of helping children get their daily fill of fruit and veg. So I wanted to share some of my feeding wisdom to help encourage healthier, happier children. It's easy to become locked in a battle of wills when it comes to dishing up healthy, nutritious food. Annabel Karmel has shred her tips on how to make children love eating vegetables . My son was a very fussy eater, so I had to think of ingenious ways to ensure he was getting a wholesome balanced diet whilst enjoying what he was eating. Truth be told, ninety percent of children go through at least one lengthy stage of fussy eating. It's so easy to feel frustrated and powerless when your child simply refuses to eat certain foods. But the key is not to give in or give up. Day in, day out, I persisted with new healthy foods, new recipes and creative ways to hide the good bits my son didn't like. In fact, it was coming up with these new and novel recipes that inspired me to create my very first book – Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner. While it can be frustrating when a child rejects the food we give them, it's actually the way that we deal with the situation that impact on their eating habits. It's not ideal to let your child get away with not eating certain foods in order to keep the peace. Giving your children a limited number of foods will only escalate their fussiness, and deprive them of the essential nutrients they need to grow and develop. If I am honest, hiding the good bits in a meal didn't always get past my children, but I found it really important to hide my frustrations. Instead, I gave them lots of praise when they ate well or tried something new. Remember, you are not alone! Keep trying out new ideas and eventually you will see positive results. Don't be afraid to quiz other mums on how they get their children eating healthy food. I used to share my recipes at my son's nursery and it felt so good to be able to help other mums in my position. Annabel says that parents should keep trying out new ideas with their children and eventually they will see positive results when it comes to a healthy diet . Tips for helping kids towards their five-a-day . 1. Try making your own healthy junk food using good quality lean meat for burgers, English muffins for pizza bases and a good way to coat homemade fish fingers is to dip them in seasoned flour, beaten egg and crushed cornflakes. For dessert it's easy to make fresh fruit ice lollies from fruit juice and pureed fruits. 2. Some kids can spot a hidden mushroom a mile off, so sometimes the best thing is to be up front about fruit and vegetables, tell them where they come from and why they are so good for you. Giving them facts could make them more interested about what they are eating. I used to offer a starter - a little teacup or saucer of something new that they could try that would be in addition to their main meal. 3. If your child refuses to eat anything other than junk food, don't worry. They will soon find there's not much point making a fuss if you don't react. 4. Without going to unnecessary lengths, try to make sure your child's food not only tastes good but looks good too. Make mini portions in ramekins, make chicken skewers or thread bite sized pieces of fruit onto a straw. 5. Avoid empty calorie snacks like crisps or soft drinks and keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand – maybe have a low shelf in the fridge with cut up fresh fruit and other healthy foods. When children are hungry, they won't wait. 6. Children like to assemble their own food, so you could lay ingredients out in bowls and let your child fill and fold their own wraps or choose their favourite toppings for their home made pizzas. 7. Most children adore cooking and tasks like squeezing fresh orange juice or cracking eggs are well within the capabilities of a young child. It's amazing how being involved in the planning and preparation of a meal can stimulate a child's appetite. 8. My chilled toddler meals are great for packing in the veggies – especially on those busy days. Based on my favourite cookbook recipes, they taste just like homemade and offer up to three of a child's five-a-day . Mini vegetable balls .

Culture and Media Secretary Sajid Javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography amid fears that it is corroding childhood. He promised legislation to force distributors to put effective age verification technology in place that would apply to those based in the UK as well as abroad. Scroll down for video . Easy access: The rising tide of online pornography is corroding children - but the Tories have now pledged to a radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze . If porn websites fail to comply, they will be blocked by a powerful new regulator which will be able to issue financial penalties. Mr Javid's pledge is a victory for the Daily Mail's long-running Block Online Porn campaign. Ministers have already persuaded internet service providers to start contacting all 19million UK households connected to the web and making them choose whether to apply family-friendly filters that block all porn sites. In addition, for any new broadband users, a block on pornographic websites is automatically applied by default. Customers now have to specifically ask for this filter to be removed – or to 'opt in' – in order to able to access adult material. But Mr Javid said a more radical crackdown was necessary to prevent children freely accessing pornography. 'Even the most attentive and engaged parents cannot know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they're seeing,' the minister told the Mail. 'In 2015 anyone, regardless of their age, is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street. 'Imagine a 12-year-old-boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a DVD showing graphic, violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women,' he said. 'Yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images – it's happening online.' Mr Javid, who is increasingly tipped as a potential future Conservative leader, cited evidence that viewing hardcore porn can lead to children 'pressuring each other to try out things they've seen, and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos'. 'It is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world – magazines, TV, DVDs or video-on-demand content. 'Such protections are taken for granted, and, as the Daily Mail has argued for years, it's time our approach to the online world caught up.' Mr Javid said if the Tories win next month 'we will legislate to put online hardcore pornography behind effective age verification controls'. 'If websites showing adult content don't have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material – they should and will be blocked altogether,' he added. An independent regulator will oversee the new system and determine how age verification controls will work. These are likely to involve similar software in place on gambling websites, which use credit card details or software to check passport details or driving licences to confirm users are over 18. Mr Javid's pledge is a victory for the Daily Mail's Block Online Porn campaign . The regulator will also be given the power to require UK service providers to block specific websites identified as distributing hardcore pornography without effective age verification controls in place. It will have the power to issue targeted sanctions, including financial penalties. Mr Javid added: 'It is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline. If we fail to take action, there is every chance the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered 'normal' by the next generation. That is not the sort of society I want to see and certainly not the sort of society I want my children to live in.' Sarah Green, of the End Violence against Women Coalition, said the group 'warmly welcomed' the proposals. Peter Wanless, of the NSPCC, said: 'We don't want children to learn about sex and relationships through the warped lens of adult pornography. 'This week we warned that ten per cent of children aged 12 and 13 were addicted to porn and one in eight had taken part in a sexually explicit video. Any action that makes it more difficult for young people to find this material is to be welcomed.' It's time to protect children  online . By SAJID JAVID, Culture & Media Secretary, writing exclusively for MailOnline . Imagine a 12-year-old-boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a DVD showing graphic, violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women. You would, quite rightly, ask whether society should allow such a young mind to view hard-core pornography. I’m sure we’d all agree that the answer would be an emphatic “no”. Yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images. And it’s happening online. The internet has been an amazing force for good in so many ways. But it also brings new threats and challenges for us to contend with. I’m a father of four young children and I know all too well that the online world can be a worrying place for mums and dads. After all, even the most attentive and engaged parents cannot know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they’re seeing. Culture and Media Secretary Sajid Javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography . In 2015 anyone, regardless of their age, is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street. And allowing young people to access pornography carries alarming consequences both for individuals and for society. It can lead to children pressuring each other to try out things they’ve seen online, and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos. And it can lead to children having unhealthy attitudes towards sex AND relationships. It is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world – whether that is magazines, TV programmes, DVDs or video-on-demand content. Such protections are taken for granted, and, as the Daily Mail has argued for years, it’s time our approach to the online world caught up. So today we are announcing that, if the Conservatives win the next general election, we will legislate to put online hard-core pornography behind effective age verification controls. Of course adults should be perfectly free to look at these sites. But if websites showing adult content don’t have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material – they should and will be blocked altogether. No sex shop on the high street would be allowed to remain open if it knowingly sold pornography to underage customers, and there is no reason why the internet should be any different. An independent regulator will oversee this new system. It will determine, in conjunction with websites, how age verification controls will work and how websites that do not put them in place will be blocked. One thing is absolutely clear: the Conservative Party’s commitment to child safety online. For the past five years we have been working with industry on A voluntary basis, an approach that led to the creation of default-on family filters. But filtering is just one way in which we can keep our children safe online. Now we can – and must – go further to give our children the best start in life. There will be some who say that this exercise is futile, that websites and children alike will find ways to get around this law. And I agree that there are always people who try to avoid legal restrictions. But we must not let the best be the enemy of the good. It is right that we act now and do what we can to restrict this content. It is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline. And it is right that we do everything we can to protect our children. If we fail to take action, there is every chance that the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ‘normal’ by the next generation. That is not the sort of society I want to see and it’s certainly not the sort of society I want my children to live in. Over time Britain’s laws have evolved to reflect our most deeply held values and beliefs, and the protection of children has long been a sacrosanct principle at the heart of that. I don’t believe that we should abandon such an important principle simply because the latest threat to our young people comes from a technology that also brings incredible benefits. There is a choice at this election, and it is between a party which backs families wants to give children the best start in life, and a chaotic Labour Party with no plan. We are clear: adults should and will be free to view legal content, but we would never stand by and allow that 12-year-old boy to buy hardcore pornography from a sex shop. It’s time to make sure our children are just as well protected online as they are on the high street."}

Judge Charles Wide QC described it as a 'highly organised, large-scale criminal enterprise' which risked the health of members of the public, as he sentenced the gang at the Old Bailey. The UK-wide conspiracy offered cheap erectile dysfunction pills to online and face-to-face customers around the world. This was a 'sophisticated and carefully planned' scam which had bases in north-east Lincolnshire and Sussex, the judge said. A counterfeit drug gang has been jailed after raking in £10million by selling fake Viagra. Neil Gilbert (pictured left) was jailed for six years and Catherine Laverick (right) was sentenced to three years and 10 months . He said the 'the real mischief is the catastrophic damage that could be caused' to the public, noting that genuine drug companies had pointed out that acid, brick dust and road paint had been found in fake Viagra. One group based in southern England was headed by Neil Gilbert, 42, who made up to £60,000 a week selling unlicensed and counterfeit drugs to unsuspecting customers. The northern branch was led by Thailand-based Stephen Laverick, but his ex-wife Catherine Laverick, 47, was in charge of day-to-day operations in the UK. And their family members and friends were recruited to assist with the massive criminal enterprise. The court heard the conspiracy lasted eight years from 2004 and continued even after the gang were arrested in September 2011 following an investigation by the drugs regulatory body, MHRA. They had used a series of 'front' companies claiming to sell jewellery, fishing tackle and cosmetics to accept the electronic payments. Proceeds were then laundered through more than 100 bank accounts both in the UK and abroad. The gang offered fake Viagra pills to unsuspecting customers around the world. File photo . Huge sums of money were transferred between the conspirators, sent offshore or, were withdrawn in cash in the UK or abroad. The money laundered or obtained through fraud by all of the defendants totalled £8,444,896. Prosecutor Gillian Jones said: 'This case is not about wanting to distribute good medicines cheaply, but rather the motivation was greed, with an utter disregard for patient safety. 'The medicines that were seized which were purported to be Viagra and Valium in fact turned out to be counterfeit,' the prosecutor said. 'This was big business. The proceeds of the supply of these medicines via websites which have been traced to various merchant facilities is in excess of £10 million - that is not the real figure. 'Not all bank accounts have been identified. Some are abroad and haven't been traced properly and some medicines were paid for in cash.' An audit kept by Gilbert revealed that the gang received £60,000 a week from the sale of unlicensed medicines during 2011 alone - a turnover of more than £3million. The money was transferred into bank accounts held by members of the conspiracy or their relatives before being withdrawn in cash or used to sustain the business, the court heard. Miss Jones added: 'There is no doubt a conspiracy to sell these unlicensed medicines existed. They had to set up and maintain websites through which medicines were sold, rent storage units and packing centres. 'Offices were rented, stationary and packaging purchased, mail boxes rented to which customers posted cash and merchant banking facilities to allow payments by cards. 'They purported to be trading fishing tackle, cosmetics or jewellery but they were just a front to hide the real merchandise which was unlicensed medicines. Seth Pennington (pictured outside the Old Bailey) who was described as Gilbert's right-hand man and carried out the day-to-day operations under the directions of his boss, was jailed for five years . Kristina Sofoulakis (left) was jailed for two-and-a-half years and Mark Bristow (right) was jailed for four years . 'As demand for the products grew the customer database widened to countries in Europe including Sweden, France and Germany.' When banks started raising concerns about the nature of the business, the gang opened accounts offshore in Belize and Panama where fewer questions were asked. Gilbert, of Ovingdean, Brighton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines, two counts of money laundering, possession of counterfeit Valium and possession of counterfeit Viagra. He was jailed for a total of six years at the Old Bailey. His partner Kristina Sofoulakis, also of Ovingdean, Brighton, admitted conspiracy to supply medicines and money laundering in the UK and offshore. She was jailed for two-and-a-half years. She had worked as a book keeper, monitoring orders and payments. Sarah Laverick (pictured) was handed a 16-month jail term, suspended for two years and was ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid work . Catherine Laverick, of Ulceby, South Humberside, admitted conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines and money laundering in the UK and abroad. She was jailed for three years and 10 months. Her son, Thomas Laverick, was spared jail after being given a 14-month sentence, suspended for two years. He set up the fake company 'Shore Catch' to buy medicines and launder money.

Seth Pennington, 42, who was described as Gilbert's right-hand man and carried out the day-to-day operations under the directions of his boss, was jailed for five years. Pennington, of Brighton, admitted conspiracy to sell or supply unlicensed medicines, selling or distributing counterfeit goods (Viagra), two counts of money laundering, one of possession of counterfeit goods purporting to be Valium and one count of possession of a medicinal product (Kamagra) without marketing authorisation. Daniel Nilsen (left) was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for a year and Lee Pettit (right) was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for a year .

He pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to supply and two counts of fraud and was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for a year. Darrell Jacob, of East Sussex, admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply unlicensed medicines and money laundering. He will be sentenced at a hearing on May 29. Judge Charles Wide QC, sentencing, said: 'This case concerns a highly organised, large scale criminal enterprise to sell unlicensed and counterfeit medicines and to launder the illegal profits of that enterprise. 'The regulatory regime concerning the products sold during this criminal enterprise exists for the whole purpose of protecting the public.' The judge said the use of counterfeit Viagra and Valium could cause 'serious harm' if taken by unwitting customers. A statement, read out in court, from Viagra manufacturer Pfizer said counterfeit pills have been found to contain toxic material including brick. Judge Wide added: 'There is no direct evidence of such harm, but that is no thanks to any great care taken in its execution. 'Each of you was involved to line your own pockets or help others line their pockets with an absolute disregard for public safety.'"}

But for many stars, such as Madonna who's been showing off her mock croc 'dealer' purse, that statement is becoming increasingly controversial, with clutches and handbags emblazoned with unsavoury slogans and pictures. And bad taste bags now seem to be everywhere, with designers incorporating weapons, naked women and even abandoned babies into their ranges. FEMAIL takes a look at the worst offenders in the luggage department. Madonna's new handbag has caused a stir for its seemingly drug related slogan, after the pop legend shared a picture of her new luggage with her fans on Instagram on Sunday . Madonna's new black crocodile handbag has caused a stir for its seemingly drug-related slogan, the word 'dealer' spelled out in bling diamond lettering. Sharing the snap of her new bag on Instagram on Sunday, the pop legend wrote, 'Dealers Choice! My favorite new handbag by Mawi!', which she followed by dice, gun and love heart emoticons, plus the hash tag #rebelheart. Known for pushing the boundaries, Madonna's latest luggage comes from East London designer Mawi Keivom, who specialises in bejeweled luxury accessories. Though the bag appears to be a Hermes Kelly, the customisation is bound to be seen as inappropriate by many and follows closely on Madonna's other opinion-splitting move - kissing Drake live on stage . Never far from a controversial fashion trend, Rihanna carried not one, but two gun themed bags while out for dinner in Santa Monica last autumn. The singer also has a gun tattoo on her torso. Rihanna is a woman after Madonna's heart and last autumn was spotted carrying not one but two gun-themed bags while out for dinner in Santa Monica. She carried a black leather Saint Laurent clutch with white line drawings of various weapons, while her black leather cross-body bag was in the shape of a gun holster. The singer seems to have a thing for the deadly weapon and even has a revolver tattoo under her right armpit. However, Rihanna doesn't draw the line at just guns and in 2013, she was spotted carrying two clutches embroidered with cannabis leaves. She has also rocked a Vivienne Westwood bag decorated with appliqued neon mock crock leather cut in the shape of a penis. The singer doesn't draw the line at just guns either. In 2013 Rihanna was spotted carrying a black clutch bag decorated with a cannabis leaf . Rihanna saw the humour in the clutch bag gifted to her by British designer Vivienne Westwood in 2013 (left); and the Barbardos singer has never made any effort to hide her love of cannabis (right) Rumer Willis, meanwhile, has previously jumped on the gun-bag bandwagon with a black leather 'Guardian Angel' bag by Vlieger and Vandam. The tote is decorated with a full moulded outline of a handgun, intended to give the impression that the accessory contains the deadly weapon. The brand also has a knife version of the same style of bag, and a slightly less aggressive handcuff design. Daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Rumer Willis has also landed herself at the centre of the handbag controversy, with this 'Guardian Angel' bag by designer label Vlieger and Vandam. The brand also has a knife version of the same style of bag, and a slightly less aggressive handcuff design . But when it comes to eyebrow-raising accessories, Rihanna and Madonna are mere amateurs compared with artist Grayson Perry, who designed his own brown leather bag in the shape of a scrotal sac on one side, and a bottom on the other. In December 2013 Channel 4's Liberty of London behind-the-scenes documentary focused on the item, which was conceived by the artist and realised by leather craftsman Andy Bates. The one-of-a-kind bag also includes a leather 'appendage' which is completed by a small gold bell supplied by Perry himself. Bates said: 'It took months to construct the bag. 'Firstly I had to carve a wooden former and then soak hand-dyed, bark-tanned calfskin in water so that it became malleable and could be moulded around the oaken testicles, a technique which is centuries old. 'Upholstery nails had been driven in so that the details of the \"pimples\" could be brought out. 'The two halves of the bag were shaped then hand-stitched together using waxed, linen thread. 'Finally, a bell, which had been supplied by Grayson himself, was added to the end of the appendage and given a ceremonial and celebratory jingle of completion.' Grayson Perry's scrotal sack handbag is designed to look exactly like it's real-life inspiration. The fully functioning handbag even has a carefully placed 'flower' on the reverse, to symbolise another key body area . US designer James Piatt has made his name by making controversial accessories, including his Peacemaker design, made with a knuckleduster handle. Priced from $89 to $169, the website reads: 'In an age when it is difficult to avoid terror take charge of the streets and look fashionable with a PeaceKeeper handbag.' Piatt's collection also features the Foundling bag, up to $539, which features a stylised representation of a crying baby kicking arms and legs in the air, was inspired by 'an infant that has been deserted'. A variety of charms are available to buy for the bag, including an airplane, a pack of cigarettes and an open window, in a reference to the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby and Michael Jackson's dangling of his son Prince outside a Berlin window. 'In an age when it is difficult to avoid terror take charge of the streets and look fashionable with a PeaceKeeper™ handbag,' says American designer James Piatt . Piatt's collection also features the Foundling bag, inspired by 'an infant that has been deserted,' and for which you can buy various charms including an airplane, a pack of cigarettes and an open window . Yet on of the most  outrageous mistakes came from high street brand Zara, which sold a canvas hold-all with images of flowers, animals - and a swastika. While in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism the symbol signifies auspiciousness and well-being, this meaning was not apparent to customers who couldn't overlook its strong association with Nazi Germany. Zara was quick to retract the bag, releasing a statement saying that it had been designed by an external supplier, and that nobody had noticed the finer details of its decoration. In 2007 Spanish fashion chain Zara was forced to retract this handbag design which featured swastika details . Chanel's Dubai audience branded this handbag as rude, offensive and gimmicky, claiming that Karl Lagerfeld was wrong to showcase the petrol can shaped bag in his collection inspired by the emirate . Meanwhile, though Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld often courts controversy, he was caught unawares by the negative reactions to his oil can handbag. Designed for his Cruise 2014/15 Chanel show in Dubai, and said to be inspired by the culture of the emirates, many criticised his offering as rude, offensive and gimmicky. While some saw past the cliche stereotyping, others were quick to note how disappointed they were that Lagerfeld had chosen to represent their identity in such a way. But he's not the first person to give a classic bag a controversial twist. In December 2013, Kanye West commissioned an artist to paint a  bizarre scene featuring nude women and mane in monster masks an iconic Hermes Birkin bag. Though deemed an eyesore by many, opinion had softened by time Kim debuted her second defaced Hermes bag, this time handpainted by daughter North West last November. Iconic handbag collectors were appalled to see Kanye West's 2013 Christmas gift to Kim Kardashian - a Hermes Birkin bag 'defaced' with a painting Kanye commissioned from an artist . Kim also owns a second hand painted Hermes handbag which was met with softer opinion, after it was revealed the bag was decorated by Kim's daughter North West . Another bag that has gone down in the controversial hall of shame is a canvas tote bag sold by DoeClothes on Amazon that says 'Mommy drinks because you are bad.' Luggage designers are the only ones getting in on the act - label companies are too. A luggage sticker created by two male designers from Vancouver caused uproar when it was released, displaying a traumatised woman bound and gagged, seemingly in your suitcase. Sold on thecheeky.com, the $7.50 stickers were all meant to look as though the suitcase had been torn open to reveal illicit contents such as stacks of cash, bags of cocaine or sex toys. The Canadian government was unimpressed, however, and the stickers were made unavailable to Canadian consumers. Right: slogan bags regularly push the limits of dark humour, much like this canvas tote bag sold by DoeClothes on Amazon.

This includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft (117 metres) The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. This will then go into orbit as normal and deliver a satellite. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Allen's vision is to create a giant air pad in the sky, allowing payloads to reach space faster and at a lower cost than existing technologies. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft will be powered by six 747-class engines, is currently being assembled at Mojave, California. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. The company will 'shift how the world conceptualises space travel through cost reduction and on‐demand access,' according to Vulcan Aerospace president Chuck Beames who made a presentation in Colorado Springs this week. The Stratolaunch Systems project was inspired by SpaceShipOne which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 for becoming the first privately funded manned vehicle to reach space. 'Stratolaunch's ability to launch from variable locations will enable satellites and humans to be efficiently inserted into their most optimal orbit at a time of the customer's choosing,' Beames wrote. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for Boeing 747-8 . Earlier this year, the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit. Picture is its twin fuselage sections . 'Launching far away from populated areas (i.e. middle of the ocean) also significantly reduces public safety risk. The Stratolaunch carrier plane is on track to make its first test flight in 2016, according to Space.com. The rocket is being developed by Orbital ATK, and the designs uses solid-fuel lower stages and an upper stage powered by RL-10 engines. But according to SpaceNews, Beames indicated that the company is also looking at other launch vehicle options. Wingspan: 385 feet (117 metres) Engines: Six 747-class engines . Fuselage length: 238 feet (72 metres) Weight: 1,200,000 lb (544,311 kg) Maximum speed: 460 knots, 530 mph (850 km/h) Maiden launch: Flight testing will begin in 2016. The first launch of the space launch vehicle is likely to take place in 2018. Satellite delivery:  Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Launch sites: Several sites are under consideration, including Kennedy Space Center, Wallops Island and Vandenberg AFB. An animation of the moment the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft delivers a rocket high into Earth's atmosphere before it goes into orbit . Each of the twin fuselages of the the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels . 'What we really want to do is focus on a lower-cost propulsion system that is evolvable in some fashion,' he said. 'We're still looking at Orbital as a potential option,' he said. 'We're widening our aperture to see if this is the right path forward.' Stratolaunch could someday support several launch vehicles, he said. As a result, Stratolaunch said it is temporarily halting work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the Orbital ATK booster. That company added that it is deferring work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the Orbital ATK booster to focus more heavily on getting the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft off the ground.

Pictured is one of its twin fuslage sections . Rare stills taken from footage shot for a recent news story by KGET 17, a Bakersfield TV station, show its huge size, according to a report by Guy Norris in Aviation Week. Hours after unveiling its next-generation 'Vulcan' rocket this week,  United Launch Alliance (ULA), ran into its first problem - the rocket's name. 'Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights,' Chuck Beames, president of the Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Aerospace, told Reuters. 'Paul Allen and Vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of SpaceShipOne more than a decade ago. We are flattered by ULA's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket 'Vulcan',' Beames said. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, selected Vulcan as the name of its new booster, which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019, after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative. 'We have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name Vulcan,' ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email. 'ULA is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so,' she said. The images show one of the two twin fuselage sections under assembly. In the news report, Scaled Composites president Kevin Mickey says the company has so far built 'roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure' for the vehicle. Instead of a satellite, the Stratolaunch airplane could launch a Dream Chaser spaceship, which would be outfitted with an as-yet-unspecified upper-stage rocket motor. 'Dream Chaser seemed to be the logical way to go,' Stratolaunch Executive Director Charles Beames said in October. The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the Hughes H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for the Boeing 747-8. Each of the twin fuselages of the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels. Stratolaunch has produced computer-generated images and videos of the aircraft, but the TV footage was the first time images of the real vehicle  have been shown. Allen has previously said his project would 'keep America at the forefront of space exploration and give a new generation of children something to dream about'. Several companies are competing to develop spacecraft to deliver cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station.

But yesterday the underemployed 26-year-old was spotted enjoying the high life in an overseas location yet again, this time at the Bahrain Grand Prix . She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain. She was introduced to the recently abdicated King Carlos of Spain and curtseyed,’ the source said. ‘Bernie Ecclestone was leading that group of dignitaries. I think she watched the race from the tower high above the circuit with the Crown Prince.’ It is thought legendary Formula 1 racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart and comedian Rory Bremner were also among those in the tower enjoying the spectacular view as Britain’s Lewis Hamilton won after battling it out over the 57 laps of the 192 mile race with arch rivals Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg. Although Beatrice receives no public funding, her jet-set lifestyle has raised eyebrows at a time when the Queen is keen to promote royal thriftiness.

The pristine white room adds to the feeling that I'm about to undergo major surgery. But I'm not. I'm here to try the wackiest face treatment to hit the beauty scene: the tuning fork facial. Offered at the upmarket Hale Clinic in London and other clinics nationwide, the scary sounding tuning forks are pieces of metal that make different pitched sounds when struck and made to vibrate.

The results mean that your face looks younger, brighter and more toned. Some say it's the non-jab equivalent of Botox. The treatment comes from the U.S. - where else? Advocates claim the 'sound waves of the forks vibrate and travel deeply into the body along energy pathways, affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed'. So far, so New Age gibberish. There seems to be no scientific proof that tuning forks can make you look younger, prettier or more rested.

I prefer my facials to involve peels, not strange pieces of metal. But while I may be sceptical, I am also, at 37, willing to try anything. Over the past few years, frown lines have begun to appear on my forehead, and my face appears increasingly pale, puffy and bloated. I explain all this to therapist Samara Reid, who's sympathetic. 'What's wonderful about these facials is they improve the appearance of the skin, but also treat the cause of the problem,' she says. 'If you're pale, you probably have poor circulation. The forks can boost blood flow, which will give you a healthier colour.' Samara has been a facial acupuncturist for 20 years, but she has started using the forks on their own and in conjunction with needles. 'I can see my jawline for the first time in a while, and my skin looks plumper and pink, rather than white' The therapies work on the same principle of Chinese acupuncture, which follows the idea that our body's energy - or 'Qi' - flows through 12 main channels called meridians. If this flow is interrupted, it can cause ill health and affect our appearance, causing premature ageing, dry skin and eye bags. Inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy, improving fine lines and circulation, leading to a clearer, rejuvenated complexion. Samara uses them together for a more powerful effect, but for the needle-phobic the forks can be used on their own. Certain forks are designed for different parts of the face and the body - there are dozens of them, with names such as 'Sun', 'Earth' and 'New Moon'. The physical vibrations have an effect on the body, while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing. Samara pings one of the forks and puts it up to my ear. The sound is magical, like a xylophone from outer space. She asks me to get on the bed and remove my socks. She explains she will tap my feet with the forks and apply needles to 'bring the energy down for grounding' (whatever that means) before starting on the face and getting the energy flowing all around my body. Samara uses a 'Gold Ohm Unison' tuning fork. She strikes it against a hard disc strapped on her leg, which creates a vibration, before putting the base of the fork on various points on my feet. I can feel a gentle, deep vibration travel through my feet and halfway up my legs. It's a strange, tingly sensation, and builds as she places the fork on more points on my feet. Within two minutes I feel as if I'm floating. She then puts needles in between my toes to 'cleanse the system'. They don't hurt at all. Then she moves to my face. She feels around my jawline and says she can feel I have raised glands. She asks if I get a lot of sore throats, and I say yes. 'The vibration from the forks can help the lymph glands to drain, which will help bring down the swelling,' she says, adding that all she's doing is 'clearing blockages', which will help everything work better. Inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy, improving fine lines and circulation, leading to a clearer, rejuvenated complexion . Marinna finds the physical vibrations have an effect on the body, while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing . She also explains that she uses tuning forks to help tighten loose muscle around the jawline. As she puts the base of the 'Earth' fork around my jawline, the vibrations go deep into my head. It feels odd, but also rather lovely. She then puts the forks up to my ears and I hear a clear, deep, bell-like sound that feels as if it's cleaning my mind. All my normal chattering thoughts are gone for a moment. Samara, who is wafting around the room ethereally, as New Aged therapists are wont to do, explains in her soft, slow voice that different forks have different sounds, varying from deep and resonant to high-pitched. She says the 'New Moon' fork is good for wrinkles and crow's feet, because it relaxes the skin. But when she starts talking about how the sounds will 'bring me into alignment with the cycles and rhythms of the cosmos', it feels a step too far. She found the effect was less pronounced the following day - although she still looked better . I begin to feel it is all ridiculous. But then she moves up my face. Samara tells me I have deep lines between my nose and mouth and my cheeks are puffy. She asks if I get a lot of sinus problems. Again, I say yes. She's more thorough than some GPs I've seen. Samara presses the forks along the side of my nose, where the vibrations should help drain the sinuses, and then my eyes, where apparently they will help reduce dark circles. Finally, Samara comes to my forehead. She tells me I have a line forming between my eyebrows, known as the 'suspended sword', which can be caused by fear and concentration. 'Do you frown when you are concentrating?' she asks. I do. 'And do you find yourself feeling frightened quite often?' she asks. Yes! This woman is a mind-reader. And then we're done. It feels as if I've been lying there for a minute, but Samara tells me it's nearly an hour. I feel spaced out. I'm so relaxed it's hard to speak. Apparently, this is normal, the result of feel-good endorphins created when pressure points are stimulated. I'm pleasantly surprised - in the mirror, my face looks less like the Pilsbury Doughboy. I can see my jawline for the first time in a while, and my skin looks plumper and pink, rather than white. The next morning, I take a long, hard look at my face. The effect isn't as pronounced as the day before, but my skin looks smoother and I have more colour. Samara recommends 12 sessions, but most people see a difference after just three or four. At £90 for an hour, it's not cheap, but it's reminded me of a basic beauty truth: a glowing complexion isn't something to be obtained in an expensive cream - it comes from being healthy inside and out. Samara packs me off with some good advice: drink fresh ginger tea to boost my immune system and try to avoid dairy, which doesn't help if you're prone to congestion, coughs and colds. Maybe I am the hemp seed type after all. I have booked a second appointment. Samara REID, the Hale Clinic, London (020 7631 0156). Experts recommend 12 sessions. At £90 for an hour, it's not cheap ."}

Sir David Nicholson said it was crucial that all the main political parties backed the NHS’s five-year plan, which calls for a 7 per cent boost to the health budget by 2020. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have pledged to find the cash – but Ed Miliband has refused. Warning:Sir David Nicholson, the retired head of NHS England, has warned of a 'substantial financial problem' at the heart of the NHS and says it is being ignored by politicians . Speaking this morning, Sir David said: ‘That £8billion needs to be available and all of the parties but Labour have signed up. But it’s important we get all the parties signed up. I think it will be helpful for the NHS if Labour agree to sign it.’ Sir David said it was vital for the NHS for there to be a ‘political consensus’ guaranteeing its budget. He said once the NHS knew what its budget was going to be it could start tackling the growing black hole in its finances. ‘They must make sure we are not building on sand but on a stable financial base,' he said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt this morning weighed in behind Sir David - admitting that the NHS faced 'a significant financial challenge over the next Parliament'. But he said: 'That’s why we have committed to finding at least an extra £8billion a year by 2020. This is the amount, Simon Stevens the current Chief Executive of the NHS said the service would need.' Mr Hunt added: 'Labour must explain why they won't find the money the NHS says it needs.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also backed Sir David's remarks. He said: 'The NHS does need more money. Now, it’s David Nicholson’s successor, as it happens, Simon Stevens identified this number: £8billion by the end of the next parliament. 'He and David Nicholson are quite right to expect political parties to explain how they’re going to come up with that money.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, appearing this morning on LBC, backed Sir David's intervention . Sir David's intervention came after Mike Dixon, leading GP and Chair of the NHS Alliance also laid into Labour. He said: ‘The NHS will be extremely worried by the lack of political consensus around the £8billion funding for the NHS’ five-year plan. 'NHS leaders have been clear that this is the minimum amount needed to maintain current service provision. 'It’s not rocket-science to predict the impact on the NHS if this commitment is not met: patients would face longer waits, services would face severe cuts and rationing, and many hospitals and GP practices would struggle to survive in their current form.’ Sir David accused politicians of ignoring a black hole in the NHS budget to boost their election chances. He warned that there was a 'substantial financial problem' at the heart of the NHS and claimed the financial peril it faces will soon be 'crystal clear'. The former NHS chief said that politicians were talking about spending more money rather than addressing existing funding gaps. Sir David was called the Man With No Shame after he refused to resign over the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital Trust scandal and retired with a gold-plated pension last year. Before he left the NHS he spoke of his 'bitter regret' over not speaking to affected patients and their families during the Stafford Hospital scandal, where 1,200 died, but he refused to quit. David Cameron was back on a building site  yesterday, while Ed Miliband was pictured outside the BBC in central London . Sir David Nicholson has worked in the NHS since 1977, the same year he joined the Communist party. After working in mental health for a decade, he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died. In 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the National Health Service, in charge of a £90billion budget and 1.3million staff. He claimed £50,000-a-year in expenses on top of a salary of his £211,000 salary, £20,000 bonus and around £47,000 of 'benefits in kind'. The package was criticised at a time when his 'Nicholson Challenge' was imposing £20billion in efficiency savings on the NHS. He insisted he had to travel by first-class to do his job, but refused to explain to MPs why his expense claims included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter. He was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the NHS where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out. In a three-year period under his rule a total of £14.7 million was spent on almost 600 'compromise agreements' preventing ex-employees from speaking out. A year after his retirement he has re-emerged to warn of problems with the NHS' finances. He told the BBC: ''I have not heard in most of the conversations politicians are having at the moment about what they're going to do about that financial hole. 'They want to talk about extra services and extra investment when actually there is a problem there to face.' The former head of NHS England also cast doubt on Tory and Liberal Democrat plans to fund the health service. Sir David Nicholson said the so-called 'Stevens plan' both parties have signed up to, which involves the government injecting £8 billion cash into the NHS while gaining £22 billion from efficiency savings, will be difficult to implement. Labour is the only main party which has not signed up to the five-year plan drawn up by current NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, instead favouring a £2.5 billion Time to Care fund paid for by a mansion tax and tobacco levies. Sir David told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What the public is being told at the moment is that 'we'll give you a bit of extra money and everything will be fine' and that actually these managers can deliver £22 billion and then everything will be fine. 'So in a sense if they find it difficult to do that and I think most of them will, I think they are going to be blamed.' Sir David launched 'Nicholson's challenge' in 2009, when he ran NHS England, and urged staff to find £20billion in 'efficiency savings' by 2015 - but it failed. He says the situation today is similarly grave and warned that the NHS will have to take 'emergency action' such as freezing recruitment. Savings could mean that patients could be forced to wait longer waits for treatment, more expensive drugs may not be used and it will be even harder to see a GP. Sir David was one of the most criticised civil servants of recent times when he was the £211,000-a-year head of NHS England. In that period he defied calls to resign from MPs and campaigners over his role in the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal, where hundreds died through neglect. Relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they resorted to drinking dirty water from vases, while nurses said they left wards in tears because care was so poor. Sir David was accused of not taking action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the trust, and later when appointed NHS chief executive in 2006. In fact at the height of the scandal, in October 2005, he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing letter to managers praising them for hitting targets. But he has repeatedly insisted that at the time he had 'no idea' of the unfolding scandal and maintained that the failings were 'system wide'. He came under further pressure when it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about another trust, University Hospitals Lincoln, where 670 patients may have died needlessly. Sir David became known as the 'man with no shame' because of his stance over the scandals and his pension pot is  likely to be more than £2million. He said last night: 'Other people will make judgements about my record. I think I made a contribution to improving services. But obviously I regret people suffered. I regret patients did not get the best possible care.'"}

This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported RT. Earlier this month Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: ‘We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.’ He added: ‘Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.’ Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world’s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam.

The 22-year-old said she kneed Jason Lee, an ex-Goldman Sachs managing director, in the groin during the struggle after he forced her onto the floor whilst naked in the bathroom of his $35,000 a month rented mansion. She sobbed and said she was left in a state of 'disbelief' and begged her friends to take her home - because she felt that it was her fault. The Irish student allegedly raped by Jason Lee, a Wall St banker in the Hamptons told how she used 'every ounce of strength left inside me' to throw him off whilst he violently assaulted her. Pictured: Lee walked hand in hand with his wife Alicia into New York Suffolk County Court on April 8 . The victim also revealed that she has not even told her family back in Ireland about her ordeal and made the 16 hour journey to New York to give evidence on her own, apparently lying to explain why she was in the US. The alleged rape happened in the summer of 2013 when the victim was in America for the summer on a J-1 exchange visa, which is commonly used by young Irish people visiting for a few months. Lee, 38, who is married, has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and faces up to 25 years in jail if convicted. The victim, who currently works in education, said that she had been working in South Carolina in a frozen yogurt shop for the summer of 2013 and had gone to New York to see this 'big city that everyone talks about'. She came to America to see the 'culture and the people' and when she was in the Hamptons was amazed at 'how cool it was'. Giving evidence the victim, who had her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and wore a black and white spotted dress, was visibly distressed and her hands were shaking. Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . When asked to identify Lee she was unable to look him in the eye and welled up in tears. She described how she went to Montauk on Long Island to celebrate with her brother and met Lee and his friend Rene Duncan at the Georgica nightclub in Wainscott after taking a taxi there. The group partied until it closed around 3am, downing glasses of vodka and orange and went back to Lee's for an after party where they drank champagne from the bottle, swam in the pool and ate pizza, the court heard. Recounting the attack, she said that Lee barged into the downstairs bathroom wearing no clothes as she was changing to leave. Initially she was 'laughing' as she thought it was a joke - until Lee forced his way in. She said: 'I fell back and hit my hip and the back of my neck.' Suffolk County prosecutor Kerriann Kelly asked if she was on her back on the floor and the victim said yes. Miss Kelly asked: 'What happened?' The victim paused and struggled to get her words out as she said: 'Um, um, he was on top of me. He had his hands either side of my head'. She then stopped speaking and held up her hands either side of her head to show the court what she meant. The victim said: 'His arms were around my wrists. I struggled. At first I didn't really understand what was happening. I said get off and he didn't. ‘I just couldn't understand when you tell somebody to get off and they don't get off. I started calling my friend. He put his hand over my mouth with the back of his hand.' At Miss Kelly's asking, the victim held the back of her hand to her mouth to show what she meant. The victim said: 'I tried to bite him but I couldn't. He told me to shut the f*** up. He said it twice. He pulled up my dress and pulled down my underwear. I was still struggling, trying to get away.' Miss Kelly asked: 'What happened?' The victim again welled up and paused before saying: 'Um, that's when he, that's when he put his penis inside me'. Miss Kelly asked: 'Did you feel it?' The victim replied: 'Yes. He started going up and down.' Miss Kelly asked: 'We're you struggling?' The victim said: 'Yeah'. Miss Kelly asked: 'We're you crying?' The victim said: 'Yeah' The victim said: 'I used every ounce of strength left inside me to pull up my knee and hit him in the groin. ‘He fell off. I sat there in disbelief and couldn't believe what had happened. I took off the dress as quickly as I could because it was disgusting. I got out of there as quickly as I could.' Lee has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and could face 25 years in jail if convicted . Asked by Miss Kelly what her emotional state was, the victim said: 'I couldn't even speak. I know I was crying but I wasn't hysterical. I couldn't believe what had happened' The victim was led outside by her friends and told the first police officer on the scene that she had been raped, though she admitted that she did not want to involve the authorities. She said: 'I didn't want anything to do with the police. I just wanted to go home'. 'I felt like it was my fault. I shouldn't have got into the car (at Georgica). I should have gone home.' She described the examination by a nurse later that morning as 'so embarrassing'. She said: 'It was hard, so hard'. In her evidence the victim presented herself as a humble person and said that she thought that Georgica was 'too fancy for us'. The victim said: 'My friend and I thought it was funny that these two men were talking to us. We were just students and we didn't have much to offer. We were out of place'. Asked by Miss Kelly if she ever gave consent to have sex with Lee, the victim replied: 'No'. Miss Kelly asked: 'Did you tell him no?' The victim said: 'Yes'. Miss Kelly said: 'Did you tell him to get off of you?' The victim said: 'Yes’. Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . In her evidence the victim also revealed that she had kept her ordeal a secret even from her own parents. Asked by Miss Kelly if she had told them, she said: 'No, nobody at home knows what happened'. The victim said that she had travelled to New York to give evidence on her own and that her brother had wanted to come with her 'so badly' but he couldn't. Under cross examination by Lee's lawyer Andrew Lankler, the victim was shown three photographs taken in Georgica. One showed her draped around Lee with two of her female friends either side of them. Another showed her between Lee and Mr Duncan. A third was a selfie the victim took and showed Lee with his arm around around her and his lips resting on her cheek. In all three she was smiling and appeared happy. She was also shown a picture of the bathroom where she claims she was raped and an image of the scratch on her leg that was caused during the struggle. The house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . The victim admitted to Mr Lankler that had it not been for her brother insisting she get in the police car, she probably never would have done so. She also said that the attack lasted no more than two minutes. Earlier the court heard from the victim’s best friend who also broke down in tears telling how she came upon her seconds after the assault. The woman said that the victim begged to be taken home as she emerged from a bathroom where Lee allegedly set upon her. The friend the court: 'She looked shaken. She looked scared. There was tears in her eyes. Her eyes were bloodshot.’ Lee was initially placed on leave from Goldman Sachs but last year left the company. His wife Alicia is standing by him and has been at court every day. The trial at Suffolk County Court continues."}

Law enforcement were called  to The Beverly Hills Hotel at approximately 1:30am where the 50-year-old reality star was hanging out at the Polo Lounge. Radar reports that at some point after midnight the mother-of-four was refused service by a bartender after she'd had a few too many vodka tonics. The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star then became very angry and reportedly shouted 'Don't you know who I am?' Scroll down for video . In jail: Kim Richards was arrested on Thursday morning after becoming belligerent while intoxicated at the Polo Lounge in The Beverly Hills Hotel . Kim - who has struggled with substance abuse in the past - then headed to a bathroom and refused to come out  - which was when cops were called. A source told the website: 'She eventually locked herself in a bathroom and was refusing to come out and causing a scene. Cops had to be called at that point.' According to Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lt. Lincoln Hoshino, Kim appeared 'belligerent with slurred speech and wreaking of a strong odor of alcohol.' Kim allegedly cursed at officers and 'passively resisted arrest,' Hoshino said. Where is went down: After drinking vodka tonics all night a bartender at The Polo Lounge refused to serve the former child star and she then became angry saying 'Don't you know who I am?' Taking a turn for the worse: After resisting arrest Kim - who apparently smelled strongly of booze - was eventually booked into a local jail where she kicked a police officer . TMZ reports the reality star had to be dragged out of the restrooms and taken to a nearby jail where she kicked a police officer. The reality star was issued a citation for trespass, resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and drunk in public and was later released on $20,000 bail at around 10:30am in the morning. She is due to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10. Sources close to Kim's family tell People that they are heartbroken at the star's behaviour which has become more erratic in recent months. 'It will never get better. … She's been a mess, showing up late to events and social gatherings and acting bizarre or belligerent or both.' 'They of course love [Kim] and want to help, but no one can talk any sense into her because she is so out of it.' Really friends? Kim's supposed BFF Brandi Glanville took to her Twitter shortly after hearing the arrest news . Cast support: Kim's RHOBH cast mate Lisa Rinna tweeted her support despite questioning Kim's sobriety throughout the latest season . Empathy: Eileen Davidson also shared her reaction on Twitter shortly after news of Kim's arrest . The news may be unsurprising for some of her loved ones, however, as Us Weekly reported that she has been treating friends and family members terribly as a source said: 'Kim has been on the outs from her family recently. 'Things are so bad that nobody can deal with her. You can’t even talk to her for two seconds -- she turns horrible to everybody.' This type of reported behaviour is so alarming that some experts believe it would be best for Bravo to dismiss the television personality from the reality programme according to People. 'This is one of those moments when her painfully public problem can become a personally promising opportunity to turn her life around,' said William C. Moyers from the Hazelden Betty For Foundation, 'But only if she takes seriously the reality of what's happened, by stepping away from the limelight and instead putting her attention on the help she needs and deserves to get better.' 'There is nothing funny or appealing about the reality of Kim's situation,' the expert added. 'She owes it to herself to step away from the limelight to get help. Her costars and Bravo should encourage Kim to take the first step or next step to recover.' Her on-screen group: Kim's sobriety was a major plot point during the fifth season of the hit reality series (pictured at the reunion in February) All talk? In Tuesday night's finale reunion show Kim was adamant that she is not struggling with her sobriety . During an episode of RHOBH in January, Kim maintained 'I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs … I don't have anything to hide,' after being asked outright if she was still sober. On Tuesday's finale reunion episode of RHOBH, the former actress was defiant that everyone stop discussing her sobriety - insisting that when she popped a pill at Eileen's poker party it was a one-off under extraordinary circumstances. 'I took a pill for a chronic pain that I was having. Did I take somebody else's pill? Yes. Was that right? No.' Kim explained of taking a pill from ex-husband Monty, who has been battling cancer. Kim continued: 'Let's get this straight real quick - I am not struggling with my sobriety, nor have I struggled with my sobriety,' she said. After questioning where anyone had any real concern for her, she again insisted: 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years. I don't appreciate all the conversations that have been behind my back. And I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Defiant: Kim told her co-stars 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years and I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Family tension: The reality star also came to blows with her sister Kyle (pictured in red) during the hour-long show with Bravo's Andy Cohen . Co-star Lisa Rinna shot back 'Well Kim I'm just going to say - you showed up at my house and you were higher than a kite,' which further infuriated Kim who stressed that she had been open about that one occasion.' Kim's RHOBH cast mates expressed their reaction to their friend's arrest on their Twitter pages. 'I was sad to hear about Kim’s incident and I wish her and her family the best,' Rinna tweeted. 'I feel badly for Kim Richards and her family my thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time,' said Eileen Davidson. And BFF Brandi Glanville wrote: 'Wanted to say thank you to @KimRichards11 for donating to our school auction in the middle of all she has going on! so proud of her. 'Real friends are their in the good times,the bad times &especially the worst times.I am blessed with real friends & am a real friend myself.' Another one under her belt: Season five came to an end with part three of the reunion show which aired on Tuesday . Kim voluntarily entered rehab for alcohol addiction in December 2011  for the third time for and has been trying to stay sober ever since. In January 2012, Kim told Bravo's Andy Cohen in her first TV interview since her rehab stay: 'I'm an alcoholic. I had so much guilt and shame for my behavior... then I drank to cover the guilt and shame to make it go away.' In a separate sit down interview, Kim said, 'I'm getting reconnected with my kids, and that's been a huge thing for me. It's not what I expected when I came home. I was like, \"Hey! I'm home! Let's all get back exactly where we were!\" And they were like, \"Ummm, life is a little different now.\" So it was like a little bit of a challenge when I got home, which I didn't expect.' She has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson, plus one son, Chad Davis. Her brood: Kim has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson and son Chad Davis . Famous: Here, Kim was in Different Strokes . Kim has now become most notable for her work on Bravo's Real Housewives franchise but her acting career began when she was six-years-old. The former child actor starred in numerous seventies TV programs including Nanny And The Professor and Little House On The Prairie. She also has a long resume of Disney films such as Escape to Witch Mountain, No Deposit, No Return and Return from Witch Mountain. Before there was such a thing as a Disney Channel star, Kim landed several gigs on the kid-friendly network with multiple television movies in her long list of Disney credits.

The Cardinal who led the service at the historic Cologne cathedral urged forgiveness for all of the victims - including co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who is widely blamed for 'deliberately' crashing the jet after locking the captain out of the cockpit. An investigation into the disaster revealed that Lubitz previously suffered from severe depression and his home computer showed he had researched ways of committing suicide. German President Joachim Gauck said the tragedy had not only provoked grief and sorrow, adding: 'We're being confronted with a disturbing act of destruction. Speaking at the ceremony, he said: 'We can't find an answer to the question of why so many people had to die because of a decision that one person made.' Small wooden angels were placed on the pews to comfort the 500 bereaved relatives of the doomed flights who were among 1,500 to attend the touching service. And flags have been flown at half-mast across the country as political and religious leaders join hundreds of bereaved relatives in the west-German city this morning.

Inside the cathedral, 150 candles were lit in front of the altar where speeches were given - one for every person killed in the disaster. The country's Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck attended the service - as did Spain's Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez and French Transport Minister Alain Vidalies. Lufthansa chairman Carsten Spohr was also among the 1,500 guests, including 500 of the victims' families. The event at Europe's largest Gothic church in the west-German city was broadcast live on screens outside the cathedral and to millions of viewers nationwide. Cologne resident Ursula Mund said she would be among those watching on the large square in the city centre. The 53-year-old said: 'Of course this is a special occasion. We have all talked a lot about what happened and are still baffled by it. We are still saddened and I feel very moved today.'

Mourners lay flowers and lit candles on the stairways leading to the cathedral - and outside the city's main railway station nearby. A bouquet of white tulips left at the foot of the cathedral had a card with the message 'depression is incalculable,' referring to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who suffered from the illness. Cologne's Cardinal Rainer Woelki - who will lead the ceremony - urged compassion for all those who died in the crash including Lubitz, saying: 'There are 150 victims.' The Germanwings Airbus 320 was en route to Duesseldorf from Barcelona when it crashed in the French Alps on March 24 - killing everyone aboard. Germany was devastated by the loss of its citizens which included 16 young students and two teachers from a high school in the small town of Haltern-am-See who were returning from a class trip to Spain. Co-pilot Lubitz, who had been diagnosed as suicidal in the past, is believed to have deliberately flown the plane into the mountainside after locking the captain out of the cockpit. Disastrous: Among those who died when the plane went down in the French Alps (pictured) were 16 young students and two teachers from a high school in the small town of Haltern-am-See . Remains: Co-pilot Lubitz who is widely blamed for the crash had previously been diagnosed as suicidal . Investigators suspect Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before putting the plane into descent and increasing the jet's speed several times as it went down. Aviation industry doctors have since demanded that German pilots undergo more extensive medical checks, while several airlines worldwide have changed rules to require two crew in cockpits at all times. Lufthansa - the parent company of Germanwings - cancelled its 60th anniversary celebrations set for April. It also placed memorial pages in major newspapers dedicated to the memory of passengers and staff who died in the disaster saying: 'We will never forget them.' Loved ones of victims previously attended a memorial event near the disaster site at the village of Le Vernet in the French Alps. On April 13, foreign ministers of Germany, Spain and France also paid tribute to the victims at Barcelona airport, where the passengers embarked."}

Ministry of Defence 1, also known as ‘Churchill’s Toyshop’, was a  weapons laboratory set up in 1939 by Winston Churchill - a firm believer in the importance of science and technology in warfare. He encouraged his scientists to trial even the most absurd of inventions - many of which never made it beyond the drawing board - but some were so successful that they played a vital role in ending World War Two. Scroll down for video . Winston Churcill is pictured gives his 'victory' sign as, wearing his famed Curchillian hat, he made a polling day tour of his constituency during the election in 1945. Churchill was the Conservative candidate for Woodford, Essex, but lost in the elections . 1. THE PANJANDRUM: A GIANT WHEEL COVERED IN ROCKETS . The Atlantic Wall was a series of robust fortifications built after 1942 by the Nazis to defend against an anticipated Allied invasion. Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace into the blue-blooded dynasty of the Dukes of Marlborough. He was an enthusiastic soldier, fighting in several wars before entering politics. Churchill was made prime minister of Britain in May 1940. He survived several strokes in later life, and on his death, he had one of the largest state funerals in history. It posed a significant obstacle for Allies, and so a potential solution to create a breach large enough to allow a vehicle through was dreamed up by one of Churchill’s military think-tanks. The panjandrum was an unlikely-looking weapon, made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle. Cordite rockets were to propel it at predicted speeds of up to 60 miles (97km) per hour, which even without the deadly force of the explosives it carried, was pretty terrifying considering it weighed around 4,000lbs (1,800kg). After extensive trials, the prototype had a disastrous final test in which it veered dangerously off course and disintegrated in the sea. It was promptly canned. The panjandrum, pictured, was an unlikely-looking weapon, made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle . 2. THE TIME PENCIL: A HIDDEN DETONATOR WITH SIGHTS ON THE FUHRER . Otherwise known as ‘pencil detonators’ or officially as ‘Switch, Number 10, Delay’, these were pencil-shaped timed fuses with a vial of corrosive copper chloride at one end. They were inserted into explosives and used as a 'time delay' to set off a bomb. They could be set to delay for between 10 minutes and 24 hours. To activate it, the vial was crushed so the copper chloride would begin to dissolve a metal wire. Once the wire snapped, it released a spring that propelled a striker down the hollow tube to the percussion cap, to detonate the explosives it had been inserted into. These were used extensively during covert operations by the SAS in Africa. One of these detonators was used in the 20 July plot of 1944, in the briefcase-bomb attempt to kill Hitler. This hidden detonator used a vial of corrosive copper to dissolve a metal wire, propelling a 'striker' down a hollow tube and detonating explosives the pencil was attached to . 3. THE LIMPET MINE: LIKE A SEA MINE, BUT WITH A MAN ATTACHED . The idea of using a human torpedo to attach explosive charges had been around since the end of World War One. Churchill’s version was attached by frogmen who used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs (two kilograms) of explosive to an enemy ship, capable of punching a large hole in the hull. Divers would carry the limpet mines underwater and attach them to ships, causing devastating damage when they exploded. They were used in the war to devastating effect. Seven Japanese ships were sunk or disabled by Allied commandos alone, using limpet mines in Singapore Harbour, 1943.

Steel and aluminium were at a premium during the war, so when inventor Geoffrey Pyke, who worked at Combined Operation Headquarters (COHQ), was considering a way of protecting Atlantic convoys beyond the reach of aircraft cover, he realised the answer was ice. Specifically, he considered creating huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway. The problem was that icebergs tend to roll over, so Pyke’s answer was a combination of wood pulp and ice, which he called ‘pykrete’. This wouldn’t sink, was much stronger than ice and wouldn’t shatter, so it could easily be carved into shape. However, it never came into being. Pyke encountered a series of engineering problems that ultimately required the use of some steel in Habbakuk. Plus, the invention of long-range aircraft fuel tanks and the use of airfields in the Azores made it redundant. Geoffrey Pyke's radical idea was to build huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway - although they never came into being . 5. THE STICKY BOMB: A DEADLY EXPLOSIVE YOU (SOMETIMES) CAN’T OUTRUN . This was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs (half a kilogram) of nitroglycerine, covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal. Its handle contained a five-second fuse and a safety pin that, upon being pulled, released the metal casing and exposed the adhesive. The adhesive was added to allow the bomb to remain attached to an enemy tank for the few seconds of delay before the bomb exploded. In theory, the sticky bomb could be attached to a passing tank, although in practice tanks often proved too dirty or wet for the bombs to stick. Despite this, 2.5 million were made and used between 1940 and 1943. The Stick Bomb is shown being assembled in 1943. This was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs (half a kilogram) of nitroglycerine, covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal . 6. ARTIFICIAL HARBOURS: A POP-UP INVASION AID TO BRING THE TANKS ASHORE . ‘Mulberries’, or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known, were portable, temporary harbours designed specifically in World War Two to help the Allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large-scale invasion. In the years leading up to the D-Day landings, it had become apparent that any attempt to land en masse on the Atlantic coastline of Western Europe would require the use of the French harbours. And to do that, the Allies would need to depend on penetrating the Nazi Atlantic Wall, which could not be done. Instead, the Mulberries were to be transported and assembled off the French coast, providing mobile port facilities including cranes, roads and piers. ‘Mulberry A’ and ‘Mulberry B’ were successfully used for the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The American Mulberry A was destroyed by storms but the British Mulberry B served for six months after D-Day before being decommissioned. ‘Mulberries’ (one pictured), or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known, were portable, temporary harbours designed specifically in World War Two to help the Allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large-scale invasion . 7. THE PIAT: A ONE-MAN ARTILLERY BARRAGE (WHEN IT HIT ANYTHING) By the middle of World War Two enemy tanks had become increasingly well armoured, to the point that they were impenetrable to the outdated infantry grenade launchers. The Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank (PIAT) was a portable mortar system that used a powerful spring to arm and launch a  bomb weighing 2.5lbs (1.1kg) with a shaped charge up to 360ft (110 metres) away. They were first issued to British forces in 1943 and used throughout the war by the Allies. Although not entirely reliable, they were quite capable of taking out enemy tanks when they hit their targets and detonated.

Elite troops were called in from Nairobi to Garissa, some 225miles from the capital, to aid in the pre-dawn attack on the university, but soldiers did not arrive until the afternoon, local media claims. The critique comes as one of the four gunmen responsible for the brutal mass-murders has been identified as a lawyer son of a Kenyan government official. Government representatives have defended the long response time, comparing fighting terrorism with being a goalkeeper as 'they only remember the one you missed'. Scroll down for video . Slow response: Kenyan elite troops were called in to aid in the pre-dawn massacre where 148 people were killed, but did not arrive until just before 2pm . Nation in mourning: A woman  cries after she has viewed the body of a relative, one of the 148 people killed in Thursday's attack on a university, at Chiromo funeral home, Nairobi . This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre . Kenya's elite Recce Company in Nairobi were called in as soon as the first reports of Thursday's attack emerged, which took place around 5.30am at Garissa University College. However, as troops were flown in from the capital, help did not arrive at the scene until just before 2pm, Kenyan newspaper Nation reports. 'This is negligence on a scale that borders on the criminal,' the Nation wrote in its editorial on Sunday, recalling how survivors said 'the gunmen, who killed scores of students with obvious relish, took their time.' Some journalists based in Nairobi who drove to Garissa after hearing the first reports of the attack arrived before the special forces, who came by air. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed defended the slow response time to the massacre, where 148 people were killed, using a football analogy. Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school . In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers . 'Fighting terrorism is like being a goalkeeper,' she said. 'You have 100 saves, and nobody remembers them. They remember that one that went past you.' Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka also dismissed the criticism. 'If you look at how we responded it was not bad at all, say, compared to Westgate,' he told the Nation. 'It takes time to assess and make the decisions, escalating it from National Security Advisory Committee to the National Security Council and then to scramble the elite units, get them to the airport and fly them to Garissa which is a two hour flight. There were many moving parts.' Earlier today, the interior ministry revealed the identity of one of the four gunmen responsible for the massacre on Thursday. Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi was the son of a government chief in Mandera County, Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. The chief had reported his son missing last year and said he feared that he had gone to Somalia, said Njoka. Abdullahi graduated from the University of Nairobi with a law degree in 2013 and was viewed as a “brilliant upcoming lawyer,” according to someone who knew him. It is not clear where he worked before he disappeared last year, Njoka said. Yesterday, the decomposing bodies of Abdullahi and his three accomplices accused of carrying out the brutal massacre were paraded in front of a large crowd at a primary school today. The authorities drove the naked, bloated corpses of the four alleged terrorists around the town in a pickup truck from the mortuary to Garissa Primary School. A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148 . Members of the public gather outside the mortuary window to view the bodies of the alleged attackers in the mortuary . People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa . Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but only Abdullahi has been named. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. Earlier in the day, security forces rescued Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding in a wardrobe at Garissa University College and drinking body lotion to survive. Survivor Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue. She told reporters that she was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen . Today survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued . The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the  siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials  said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a £145,000 bounty on his head.

Relatives are reunited with their loved ones who survived the attack (centre) at Nyayo stadium in Kenya's capital Nairobi . A woman who survived the attack (centre) is reunited with relatives at Nyayo stadium in Nairobi today . The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning today, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' al-Shabab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group. The militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia. 'This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties. 'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation. 'Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,' he said in a televised speech. 'Radicalisation that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night. It occurs in the full glare of day, in madrasas, in homes, and in mosques with rogue imams.'"}

The 28-year-old has been suspended from the network for a week after being caught on camera telling a parking lot attendant she should 'lose some weight, baby girl', adding 'I'm on television and you're in a f---ing trailer, honey'. But according to her blog, the former model is dedicated to helping women feel 'comfortable in their own skin'. In a self-aggrandizing rant, McHenry tells her readers she is 'taking a stand' against 'sexist'  commercials that focus on 'appearance alone'. It is an almost unrecognizable tone from the one she took on April 6, when she raged at towing company clerk Gina Michelle: 'Just being here makes my skin crawl... Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Women's rights champion? Britt McHenry encourages her blog readers to 'be the woman with a voice, not the sex-ed up body without one'. She said she  posted this selfie as an example of female empowerment . Pious: Just eight days before her outburst, McHenry lectured her Facebook followers on the impact of words . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an Advanced Towing employee in Arlington, Virginia . Glamorous: Originally from New Jersey, McHenry is a sideline reporter for ESPN based in Washington D.C. Pictured is Gina Michelle, the clerk abused by McHenry and told she needed to lose some weight . McHenry uses her blog post to lament the pressure put on women to appear a certain way. She describes a cheeseburger advert that features an almost naked woman, writing: 'When so many females fight for gender equality in pay and opportunity–still to this day in 2015–an advertisement like that only sets women back generations.' 'Women,' she pontificates, 'can be comfortable in their own skin... Be the woman with a voice, not the sex-ed up body without one.' Regaling her own life story, McHenry tells readers: 'Even at 18, and yes as a model once, I never fathomed resting on appearance alone. 'In a pre-Instagram era, I was more worried about putting my nose in a book rather than flaunting it (and other female assets) in a portfolio book. 'If a Champion Sportswear ad helped pay for my student loans, great. But, I wanted to be an attractive AND intelligent woman.' She closes with a rallying cry against the cheeseburger ad that inspired her diatribe: 'Put the burger down during the big game's party and pick up some chips and salsa. It will be my silent act of solidarity.' It seems her activism waned as she came face-to-face with mother-of-three Gina Michelle at the Advanced Towing Company after her car was removed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Arlington, Virginia. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f-----g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying in the video. The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well lets get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f-----g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . She's outta there: ESPN immediately responded by suspending McHenry, but only for one week . The towing company told TMZ 'she was in the wrong' but insists there are no hard feelings towards McHenry. In a statement emailed to DailyMail.com, a spokesman said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. 'At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry. 'As a small business, we saw no benefit to releasing the video, except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing, public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter. The video was not licensed or sold to anyone.' There is now a petition to have McHenry fired from her role in Washington, D.C., slamming the sportscaster as 'derogatory, classist and body-shaming.' The Change.org petition reads: 'Currently McHenry is serving a mere 1-week suspension for her outburst. 'By retaining Britt McHenry as a prominent public figure of Sports Media, ESPN Inc. and other networks effectively send a loud public message condoning this type of cruel behavior. 'The comments captured in the video represent an unacceptable attitude of hatred for lower-income Americans and individuals whose features do not match traditional beauty standards. 'Britt McHenry lost her credibility as a professional journalist when she shamelessly broadcasted this hatred both to the victim in the video and to a global audience of thousands who now bear witness to it. 'Continuing to support Britt McHenry directly threatens not only her potential future victims, but also the integrity of ESPN, the field of American sports media, and journalism as a whole. As the video, obtained by Live Leak, spread online, ESPN, which is owned by Disney, was forced to react. A spokesman confirmed McHenry had been suspended for one week. It is unclear whether a more serious punishment will be handed down. Disney has so far refused DailyMail.com's request for a comment. McHenry, who appears impeccably groomed on camera, berated Michelle for her appearance and her job . The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . The backlash: Twitter users mocked McHenry's arrogance and emphasis on appearance . A petition has been launched to see McHenry removed from the network following her outburst . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . Right after the incident took place, McHenry took her Twitter account to rant about how Adanced Towing is 'corrupt'. She has since deleted the tweet. On Thursday, she turned to social media again to apologize for her actions, saying it was an 'intense and stressful moment' for her. She posted online:  'In an intense and stressful moment, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and said some insulting and regrettable things. As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake.' However, her apology has done little to quell the tirade of fury, and the following day weight discrimination groups began speaking out against McHenry. 'It was extremely sad,' James Zervios, vice president of marketing and communications for the Obesity Action Coalition, told the New York Daily News. 'This is not something that should be socially acceptable. 'It shows that weight bias is something that’s very common in our society.' According to The Big Lead, McHenry was eating Hunan Chinese restaurant on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington when her car was towed. Advanced Towing has been berated in the past with users complaining of double charges and unfair car removals. The firm has an F rating on the Better Business Bureau site."}

Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train about 1.40pm on Wednesday. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent of any swearing. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Hafeez Ahmed Bhatti told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the ugly incident. 'She asked my wife why she was wearing a scarf when it was hot outside - when my wife answered her I thought the woman was asking to be friendly,' Mr Bhatti said. 'Then she started saying Muslims like us are trying to conquer Australia and behead everyone here. We were absolutely shocked. 'It was just very disappointing.' Mr Bhatti said another woman nearby supported the racist woman, and the incident caused his family to miss its flight home. 'She said all Muslims should be kicked out of Australia - I tried to calm things down by telling her we love everyone,' Mr Bhatti said. He also said his wife was 'very shaken up' after the incident, to the extent she questioned if it was worth staying in Australia. 'This sort of thing has happened before, but you try to ignore it and the ignorant people behind it; there are lots of very good people in Australian and only a few bad ones,' he said. 'God bless Stacey Eden who supported us.' Hafeez Bhatti, who was racially abused along with his wife on a Sydney train, thanked the woman who stood up for them . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted .

Mr Bhatti reached out to Ms Eden on his Facebook page after the story emerged. 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Bhatti vented his frustrations with the attack, when he posted: 'once again, victim of racism by an old Christian lady.' He also discussed the events and said it started after the woman touched his wife's head like she was blessing her, before 'she started her ignorant comments'. Mr Bhatti also said his community, near Brisbane, had invited Ms Eden to visit them one day. 'They all want to thank her for what she did to help us,' he said. He also confirmed he will speak with police on Friday regarding the incident. Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the middle-aged woman's offensive public transport tirade to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport .

'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg.

'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls.

Kim Hill, from Suffolk, has bravely waived her right to anonymity and spoken about how she was abused by Derek Osborne from the age of four. The now 31-year-old revealed she was forced to dress up in her mother's lingerie at the age of eight, and was even made to watch pornographic films. Kim Hill (left) was abused for years by her step-father but never revealed her past until her partner Rob (right) encouraged her to approach the police about her attacker. The couple pictured on their wedding day in 2013 . For years, Kim bottled up the painful memories until she met her husband Rob, 34, who guessed that she had been abused and helped to put Derek behind bars 20 years after the offences. While planning their wedding in 2013, Rob asked his fiancée if she had been abused as a child due to her withdrawn nature. His question finally prompted Kim to confess what happened to her. The mother-of-two says that Rob's question finally gave her the nudge that she needed to reveal her past. 'I'd waited my whole life to hear that question. I was desperate for someone to bring it up, so I could tell them the truth. Derek Osborne (left) abused Kim (right as a child aged seven) from a young age encouraging her to get into his bed for 'cuddles' At the age of nine Derek (pictured) forced Kim (pictured left as a child) to dress up in her mother's lingerie and watch porn films . 'When Rob asked me it was my chance to share the painful secret I'd been hiding – that the man I had called dad had abused me.' She told Rob how her step-father made her climb into bed with him and kiss and cuddle him. He even attacked her two days after her 12th birthday, while taking her out for a celebratory meal. Speaking about the abuse, Kim, who married Rob in 2013, said: 'I didn't know any different so I accepted what he was doing as normal. 'I saw him as my dad. I just thought my dad loved me very much.' Kim's biological father died when she was young and she was aged three when Derek began a relationship with her mother. She says that as a young child Derek's attention was originally welcomed in her large family. 'I scrambled for mum's attention with my three siblings. But I was always Derek's favourite. 'He'd come and tuck me into bed while Mum watched television downstairs.' But the attention soon turned sexual. She said: 'He would kiss me on the lips. Kim never revealed her past until Rob asked her if she had been abused ahead of their wedding . 'He often called me into his bed at night for a cuddle, so he could touch me under the covers. 'I was too young to know how wrong it was. I thought nothing of it. But years went by and the touching became more intimate.' Aged seven, Kim was taught sex education at school which soon made her realise that her step-father's actions were not normal. She said: 'I found out at school how babies are made. 'I was horrified, all I could think was, \"What if I have a baby growing inside me?\" 'I knew how upset mum would be if she found out and I'd get into so much trouble.' Kim was too scared  to approach anybody about her attacker and the abuse continued. She said: 'When I was nine, he forced me to dress up in mum's underwear, then he made me watch sick porn films. 'I didn't know any different so I accepted it as normal.' But that all changed when aged 10, Kim saw a television programme about sexual abuse. She said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I realised my dad was abusing me. 'Next time he tried to touch me I was in tears and pushed him away. Although he was angry, I stood my ground. Part of me wanted to tell mum, but I didn't want to hurt her.' But weeks later, her mother sat her down with some news that would come as a welcome relief. 'She told me that her and my stepdad were splitting up. Finally, I could escape him.' However to Kim's horror her mother wanted to keep Derek around as a father figure. For her 12th birthday, he took her out for a celebratory dinner. But he pounced when they were alone at his house afterwards and performed a sex act on her. She said: 'My feet were kicking as hard as I could but I wasn't strong enough to push him away. 'A look of anger spread across his face as he tried to hold me down. 'After, I felt disgusting. That was the last time he abused me. Afterwards he moved away with a new partner.' Ahead of the wedding Kim reported the abuse to the police where it was revealed Derek had abused other girls . Although she had finally escaped her attacker Kim was still living with the effects of the abuse. She said: 'I'd become so withdrawn, and jumped whenever anyone brushed past and touched me.' Although Kim met a man aged 18 and had a daughter at 23, the relationship did not work out. She found it difficult to trust and stayed away from the dating scene until a friend set her up with Rob. She says that right from the start Rob offered her huge support and she found him trustworthy. 'I wasn't sure and it was the first proper date I'd had since having my little girl. 'He talked about his sister, who's also a single mum and how difficult she's found it. 'From the very beginning, Rob was so understanding.' Kim and her daughter moved in with Rob after six months and just weeks later in August 2010 he proposed. Kim said she was able to seek justice after confessing all to Rob. Pictured on their wedding day . Kim has began to visit counselling sessions and says she is beginning to move on . The couple had a son in January 2012 and started planning the big day. She said 'Me and Rob shared everything, but I still didn't dare tell him what dad had done. We'd started making plans and wanted the perfect venue.' While searching for wedding venues, Rob asked her if she had been abused as a child. The question came as a huge shock to Kim. She said: 'I broke down in tears. I didn't know how he could guess. 'He said that I was different to other women because I was withdrawn. He encouraged me to tell mum what had happened. 'And with his support the next day I called the police.' After her brave confession Kim discovered that she was not alone and Derek had attacked a string of victims. 'I was the first victim to come forward but soon other victims spoke out and said Derek had abused them too. ' Kim has started her own blog to share her experiences and inspire others . When he was arrested, Derek denied all the offences and even claimed one of the girls had made sexual advances towards him. With the trial looming, in September 2013 Kim and Rob tied the knot. She said: 'I didn't think of Derek once. He might have destroyed my childhood, but he wasn't going to ruin the best day of my life.' In May 2014, Derek, then 72, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court where he admitted 16 counts dating from 1982 and 2004, including eight of indecent assault and seven of indecency with a child, related to Kim and two other schoolgirls. He also admitted raping another woman. He was jailed for 21 years. In October 2014 one count of gross indecency with a child, not relating to Kim, was quashed at the Court of Appeal in London, but his sentence remained the same. Kim said: 'I went to see him sentenced. He was so pathetic and frail, he was unrecognisable.' Judge John Holt said Derek's victims had all suffered 'devastating' psychological effects. He said a probation officer who interviewed Derek had assessed him as 'dangerous' and said he had shown 'very little' genuine remorse. Now he is behind bars, Kim says that she has been able to begin to move on. 'I've started counselling and healing sessions with the Happiness Foundation. They're helping me to accept it and move on. 'Rob is there with me every step of the way and I know he's so proud. I've also started a blog about everything I've been through. 'I've had so many victims of sexual abuse thank me for telling my story and showing you can put your abuser behind bars – even years later.'"}

Instead, the night turned to tragedy when the little girl Rana died either during birth or within minutes afterwards. A coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth in 2012 was 'grossly inadequate' and may have contributed to the death of the baby. But in a move many people would find extraordinary, the couple refuses to blame the midwife, and are in fact is defending her actions. Alanna and Stephen Goetzinger (pictured with their daughters Kayla, right, and Alice, left) lost their daughter during a stillbirth in 2012 and have spoken out against the coroner's report which blames their midwife . Coroner James McDougall said that the midwife failed to adequately prepare for the Rana's birth, allowed the delivery to take place in 'unsafe conditions', and that her failure to provide proper medical assistance may have caused the death of the Goeztinger's baby. Coroner McDougall found that Rana had died either 'during or shortly after birth' from meconium aspiration, a condition where a foetus inhales their faeces before birth, preventing them from breathing. The  report also found that the midwife, who handed in her resignation following the inquest, changed her statement about the events of the evening, including the time of the baby's birth and whether the baby had exhibited signs of life. Three years on, the couple, who live on a farm in Kanungra in south-east Queensland, have spoken about the night Rana was born, and what they claim was a tragic and unavoidable event. Alanna, 39, and Stephan, 57, are adamant that Rana was stillborn, and that it was very clear from the moment she was born that she had died before birth. 'We could see a problem as soon as she was born. It wasn't like I was holding her for a while and then we all of a sudden noticed. When she was lifted out of the water and put into my arms she was limp, there was no life in her little body,' Mrs Goetzinger, 39, told Daily Mail Australia. Alanna Goetzinger with her daughters Alice and Kayla while she was pregnant with Rana . Mrs Goetzinger said that her daughter Rana was stillborn, and that the coroner's report which claims she died 'during or shortly after birth' was fabricated . The report found that the midwife changed whether there were any signs of life, and also changed the time of Rana's birth from 11.40pm to 11.45pm to cover a seven minute delay in calling for emergency care at 11.47pm. 'On initial questioning, midwife M stated that she \"was very surprised as things were going well and the baby had a heart rate at birth\",' the report said. 'She then stated that \"there was no heart rate and no signs of life after birth\".' The report also concludes that the midwife allowed Mrs Goetzinger to give birth at home despite her being at greater risk for meconium aspiration, as a result of her age, the higher end weight of her previous pregnancies, and the fact that she had carried Rana for 41 weeks in utero. It states that the care the midwife provided 'fell significantly short' of what would be expected of someone of her experience, and that she had  failed to notice meconium in the water when Mrs Goetzinger's waters had broken as a result of the poor lighting provided by only having candles in the room. 'There were lights on in the other rooms, but I had chosen to have low lighting to calm me,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'My midwife also did spot meconium when my waters broke but that was only moments before I actually gave birth. When she came out she was stained with it, which means she probably suffered from the asphyxia days before I gave birth.' Alanna and Stephan on their wedding day (left), and Alanna with two of the couple's daughters . Alanna and Stephan have defended their midwife against the findings of the coroner's inquest . 'We didn't sit around and make a cup of tea deciding whether to call the ambulance. As soon as Rana came out the midwife yelled to my husband to call them,' she said. The Goetzinger's travelled to the Gold Coast University Hospital in an ambulance, where Rana was pronounced dead and was taken away for an autopsy after doctors expressed concerns over the actions of the midwife and her sub-standard attempts at CPR. The couple said that their daughter was taken off them without their consent, and that they were both traumatised by the knowledge that she was being autopsied without permission. 'They just took her off us and chopped her up for autopsy. They never asked. It was horrific,' said Mr Goetzinger. 'The poor little thing didn't even get to breathe and they were cutting her open,' Mrs Goetzinger said. The couple said that Federal police officers showed up at their house in the hours following the birth and treated their home like a crime scene. They said were made to feel like criminals for choosing to have a home birth, and chastised for cleaning up the birthing room which had been wiped down following the birth. 'It was disgusting the way we were treated, like we'd intentionally murdered our baby,' Mrs Goetzinger said. When the results of the autopsy were returned to the family, Mrs Goetzinger said that she was appalled, and that neither she nor her husband were ever approached for questioning about the events of the night. Mrs Goetzinger said that she and her husband were made to feel like criminals for choosing a home birth . 'My only consolation is that I have my two beautiful daughters,' said Mrs Goetzinger . 'They didn’t once in three whole years contact us to ask for my opinion. They didn’t question me, they didn't tell me anything at all. You'd think if they really wanted the truth would they would have asked for my version of events,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'Losing Rana was tragic and devastating and I was lost for weeks, and then for both us and our midwife to be treated like criminals was just too much,' she said. The midwife, who stepped down following the inquiry, was found to not have formal infant CPR training. She was cautioned by both the coroner and was reported to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, who launched an investigation into her conduct and concluded that the midwife failed to uphold healthcare standards of the profession. 'I feel like they needed to crucify someone, and they blamed the midwife. She is a beautiful person and did nothing wrong,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'She lost her job over this which is just awful. She lost her livelihood for no good reason whatsoever, and apart from us losing our baby that is the most horrible thing that has come out of this,' she said. 'Nobody is to blame, it just happened. It was tragic and devastating but it just happened.' Mr Goetzinger said he wants an apology from the coroner for the claims in the report, and want to see their midwife's license reinstated without restriction. Mr Goetzinger said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births . 'If I had millions of dollars I would sue them for fraudulent proceedings because the document is a fraud, it's full of contradictions,' Mrs Goetzinger said. 'They made my midwife out to be a complete villain. She is a registered nurse and has everything she needs to be a midwife and there is nothing more she could have done,' she said. 'My only consolation is that I have my two beautiful daughters, and I do feel Rana around me. She's the one who is pushing me to speak out and tell her story.' Mr Goetzinger said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births. 'It is so nice to have child born at home, it’s so much better and familiar. People should make up their own mind without interference from the authorities,' he said. The couple are staunchly anti-vaccines, and believe in allowing parents to choose for themselves how their children's health should be managed."}

For the Geordie Shore star, who has lost has lost two and a half stone and four dress sizes over the past year, is looking thinner than ever. In fact, she is looking so thin, that some have questioned whether the 24-year-old actress has taken things too far. Scroll down for video . Over the last year Charlotte Crosby has lost over two and a half stone, but the reality TV star has come under fire for this picture in which she appears to be very slim . One Twitter user commented that she thought Charlotte was 'far to skinny [sic] whilst other commented on her Instagram pictures . One user on Twitter posted a picture of the star with the comment: 'Charlotte Crosby is far to skinny! She's promoting to girls that she has a \"healthy body\" [sic]' Another commented on her Instagram: 'I can guarantee you she starves herself to look like this.' But Charlotte is not the only Newcastle resident to have lost weight. Her co-stars Vicky Pattison, 27, Holly Hagan, 22, and Marnie Simpson have also all dropped the pounds over the past 12 months. Charlotte has a lost a lot of weight over the last 12 months (left, before the weightloss, and, right, after) , she puts this down to exercise and having cut back on take-aways and booze . Charlotte in 2013 before her weight loss transformation attending the Radio 1 Teen Awards at Wembley . And the women aren't afraid to show off their bodies. Vicky regularly posts then and now pictures of herself to her 1.6million Instagram followers charting her weight loss progress. Holly and Marnie are the same. Sharing pictures of their super slim bodies, often in bikinis or skimpy outfits. But have these girls taken things too far? Well, one doctor thinks they might. Dr PhD Marilyn Glenville told us that there is a lot of pressure on women in the media to try and stay thin. Vicky Pattison regularly posts pictures of herself to Instagram, before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Marnie Simpson said she felt compelled to lose weight after seeing that her fellow Geordie Shore Castmmates had dropped so many pounds . She said: 'There is too much too much pressure as they are in the public eye and understandably want to look good but it may push them into unhealthy eating patterns in order to achieve that look. 'Because of the pressure the weight loss can be taken too far and too fast as with many of the Geordie Shore girls.' She continued: 'When weight loss is very fast the body is encouraged to lose fat, muscle and water. Water is just a temporary loss and you also do not want to lose muscle. 'And for women it is important not to lose too much fat, because then periods will stop and it can affect not only fertility but also increase the risk of problems like osteoporosis because the woman has lost the protection of the female hormones.' Holly Hagan is the fourth Geordie Shore girl to dramatically lose weight, she had even posted a picture of herself trying out a waist trainer to Instagram (left) Holly posted this picture of herself to Instagram where he ribs are clearly visable . Holly was larger when she started on the show, but, she has since slimmed down after revealing she felt fat . Dr Marilyn also revealed that it is best for fans to stick away from following celebrities in their diets. She said: 'It is better to choose a plan to suit your body and to take into account whether you have a sedentary job or working away from home a lot so can’t control your food easily. 'It will make a difference if you are very stressed and also how old you are because metabolism tends to slow down as we get older. 'It is important that you choose a diet that suits your lifestyle, age and how you want to look so that you don’t end up looking and being too thin or causing health problems.' However two of the girls have hit back at the criticism of their weight. Holly told the BBC: 'What really annoys me is when I read articles and it's like, \"Holly lost three stone in one month\" and that is giving such a wrong impression to the girls out there reading that and thinking, \"Oh yeah I can lose three stone in one month\". She continued: 'They just pluck these figures out of thin air, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen because that could have really damaging effects.' Charlotte has also denied losing weight just for her DVD: 'Sadly I just put weight on through loads of partying, drinking, having a boyfriend and eating takeaways every night,' she said. 'I don't know why I would ever want to put weight on and look that fat and ugly. Why would anyone ever want to do that? It's so stupid that people even say that.' Much has been made of just how the Geordie Shore girls, who were famous for their booze and take away heavy diets, have managed to loose so much weight. Here's what they've said... Charlotte Crosby . Charlotte's diet was not the most conventional. As her BFF Vicky revealed that she uses a controversial sounding 'three tin' regime. 'She basically thinks you should eat three tins a day and that's it. So you could have a tin of beans for your breakfast, tin of tuna for your dinner and a tin of pears for your tea,' said Vicky. Charlotte also introduced exercise into her life to beat the bulge. She started working with celebrity trainer Richard Callender and released a number one best selling fitness DVD. Holly (plain yellow bikini) recently posted this picture of her and Charlotte saying that the pair were now proud of their bodies . Holly Hagan . Holly, who recently posted a picture of herself in a Kim Kardashian-style waist trainer to Instagram, trains hard and has lost over a stone and a half. She said: 'I do work hard to maintain my body as I work with a personal trainer 2/3 times a week, and we train really hard together.' She also maintains a calorie-controlled diet and has previously revealed that she prioritises fruit and vegetables over stodgy treats. 'Carrots before carbs,' she explains. 'I've been doing it for so long now that when I eat s*** it makes me feel bad. I prefer to be healthy now.' A typical day for her would be scrambled eggs for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch, and for dinner, steak and vegetables. Vicky Pattison . Before embarking on her weightloss transformation Vicky survived on a diet of takeaways. Now, she's a svelte size six after insisting that producers provide the reality show stars with a healthier menu - something she says has 'made all the difference'. 'It’s made such a difference,' she says. 'You don’t get much time to cook, so we used to have a crisps cupboard and a chocolate drawer, which we'd descend on like a pack of raccoons after a night out. 'With the catering, we swapped our fry ups for eggs or porridge for breakfast and then salads and meat platters for lunch. That made keeping our figures loads easier.' Vicky also followed the her own Seven Day Slim routine, which she turned into a DVD, which saw her shed three stone over the course of six months. Following her dramatic slim down she was unhappy with the way her breasts looked and had a boob job to plump them back up again. Vicky posts these pictures to her Instagram detailing how she has transformed her body . Marnie Simpson: . Marnie decided to lose weight at the end of last year after becoming jealous of her co-stars slim bodies. She dropped 17lbs - over a stone - in just one month and said: 'A lot of people started to pick up on my weight on Twitter and say some really hurtful comments. 'I remember one person said, \"You used to be the skinniest and now you're the fattest.\" 'Another said, \"Your face is huge,\" because when I do pile on the pounds it always shows up really quickly on my face in the shape of a double chin. 'There were also lots of comments about being be the \"fat one\" in the show and the \"fat lass\". 'I'd be lying if I said those comments didn't really hurt - you try to ignore them but it is impossible.' After a month of intensive work-outs and eating healthily, the reality TV star went from 9st 10lbs to a super-slim 8st 7lbs."}

'Our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance, HDR, refocusing, and more,' said the firm . And if a patent awarded earlier this month is anything to go by, the camera on the iPhone 7 could take even better photos. The papers, originally filed in 2011, detail a three-sensor camera that splits light to boost the number of pixels it can manage. The patent is called 'Digital camera with light splitter' and explains: 'A digital camera component is described that has a light splitter cube having an entrance face to receive incident light from a camera scene. 'The cube splits the incident light into first, second, and third colour components that emerge from the cube through a first face, a second face, and a third face of the cube, respectively. Computers with Intel's RealSense 3D camera can recognise and respond to facial expressions and hand gestures. The technology is already fitted to a range of laptops and last week Intel's boss Brian Krzanich unveiled a version designed for smartphones and tablets (refocusing examples pictured) 'First, second, and third image sensors are provided, each being positioned to receive a respective one of the colour components that emerge from the faces.' Put more simply, instead of using a standard single sensor to collect the data of an image, the proposed system uses mirrors to split the incoming light in three, namely green, red and blue. These beams of light are then projected onto three sensors. A patent filed by Apple in 2011 and awarded earlier this month details a three-sensor camera (illustrated) that uses mirrors to split incoming light in three - namely green, red and blue . These beams of light are then projected onto three sensors. Each sensor can then collect and use more pixels per photo compared to a single sensor.

The files also explained that these mirrors could stabilise the image and direct the light in a way that accounts for shaking hands, for example. In its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple added a new sensor with so-called Focus Pixels to its 8MP iSight camera. It also improved its facial detection and exposure control. Focus Pixels use a bespoke image signal processor to collect more information about an image, including lighting, to provide faster autofocus. To showcase how good this technology Apple has launched a marketing campaign that only uses images shot on its latest handsets. Each photograph is accompanied by a caption on the online gallery, which says where it was taken, whether an app was used to improve the shot and a tip about why it is a good photo, which amateurs could use to boost their photographic prowess. For example, an image of a man in a field of sunflowers says: 'Photographing a subject from behind can add wit to a photo. Here, the subject and the flowers are both facing away from the camera.' Similarly, photographer Dan Rubin recently produced a range of photos for fashion brand Vida, each shot on the iPhone.

Jason Lee forced himself on the 20-year-old in a bathroom and told her to 'shut the f*** up' so her friends in the next room would not hear. The assault ended when the girl kneed him in the groin and staggered out in such a ‘hysterical’ state she was unable to talk. Lee tried to downplay the incident and said it was 'no big deal' and dismissively told the first police officer on the scene: 'We're good, you can go', the court heard. Lee walked hand in hand with his wife Alicia into New York Suffolk County Court on Wednesday . Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . The rape allegedly happened when Lee, 38, invited the victim and her friends to party at his rented $33,000-a-month mansion in the Hamptons on Long Island, New York during the summer of 2013. On the first day of the trial, Kerriann Kelly, the Chief of the Major Crime Bureau at Suffolk District Attorney's office, said that Lee and his victim were 'from such different worlds that they might have been from different planets'. She had spent the summer in New York on a J-1 student work visa and was staying with her brother for a night out before flying home to Ireland. Lee was a high flying executive at Goldman Sachs who lives in Manhattan, but Miss Kelly said: 'What you see is not always what you get'. She told the court: 'What you see in the court room this morning is a defendant dressed in a very professional suit, his hair is nicely combed. he is copiously taking notes as I speak. 'That's not the same individual the victim encountered in the early morning of August 20 2013. Not even close. 'What she encountered was a man who wanted one thing and one thing only, and that thing was sex. He used her to get it.' Lee has pleaded not guilty to first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault charges. He could face 25 years in jail if convicted. On Wednesday he walked into Suffolk District Court wearing a dark suit hand in hand with his wife Alicia, who sat in the public gallery. The court was told that Lee and his friend Rene Duncan met the victim and her friends at the trendy Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott on August, 19 2013. The two men were there celebrating Lee's 37th birthday and they invited the Irish group back to his mansion a short distance away. Miss Kelly said that they were having a good time partying the night away, drinking wine and eating pizza they found in the freezer. The victim and her female friend stripped down to their underwear and got in the pool but Lee got completely naked and jumped in after them. Afterwards, around 6am, the victim went into a downstairs bathroom to change, and she 'became aware that Jason Lee was trying to force his way into the bathroom by pushing open the bathroom door,' Miss Kelly said. 'The victim saw him, he was naked, and she thought: \"Is this a joke?\" She pushed back and said: \"What do you think you're doing?\"' Miss Kelly said that the victim pushed so hard she left her fingerprints on the door, but Lee was too strong and forced the door open. As he did so she went flying onto her back, hurting her hip and scratching her leg. Miss Kelly said: 'Now he had her exactly where he wanted her, on the floor, on her back and he climbed on top of her and he held her down.' The victim tried to shove him off but she was unable to. Miss Kelly said: 'She asked him to get off her. She told him: \"No\"'. Lee has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and could face 25 years in jail if convicted . 'The defendant put his hand over her mouth and held his hand down so hard that the victim tried to bite him but was unable to. 'Then he told her to shut the f*** up, shut the f*** up. 'He didn't want anyone to interrupt what he wanted to do at that time and in that place - on his birthday'. Miss Kelly described how Lee pulled up her dress, pulled down her underwear and raped her. She said: 'He had no regard for her. 'He had no condom and the 37-year-old Jason Lee you see before you here had no regard for the 20-year-old Irish girl who was just visiting (her brother). 'He took advantage of her because he wanted to have sex and because he was going to do whatever he had to do to get it'. Miss Kelly said that the attack only stopped when the victim managed to knee him in the genitals, making him 'back off in pain'. As she waked out of the bathroom the victim was 'hysterical and crying', Miss Kelly said. Miss Kelly said: 'She couldn't say what was wrong to her. Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . 'Her brother was upset and said: \"What's happened to my sister? What went on in that room?\"' 'The victim couldn't speak she was so hysterical.' The police were called by Mr Duncan because he thought that his car had been stolen, though the court was told that he had actually loaned it to some of the victim's friends who had left earlier. During the call to the 911 dispatcher Lee allegedly said: 'It's not big deal, there is no problem here, we don't need you to come to this house'. The victim's brother however insisted they come and said: 'There's something wrong with my sister'. Lee was the the first to approach East Hampton police officer Sarah Mortensen when she arrived at the mansion and told her: 'We're good, you can go. We don't need you. We have got this under control'. However the victim's brother also approached her and said that Lee had 'done something to my sister'. The victim then got into the officer's car and recounted her ordeal, at which point she called for backup. During this time Lee disappeared and would not be found for two hours, the court was told. Whilst in hiding he called Mr Duncan numerous times, called two taxis - one of which was turned away by officer Mortensen - and tried to hail an Uber taxi multiple times. He was eventually found in a Range Rover parked in the driveway which had tinted windows 'curled up in the fetal position', Miss Kelly said. When asked by a police officer what he was doing, he said he was 'embarrassed' and 'fell asleep' That night the victim was taken to be examined by a sexual assault nurse who found she had injuries to her vagina. She also had a scratch almost the entire length of her leg, an injury that was consistent with her account of the incident. The house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . At that point the victim realised that she did not have her dress and could not find it. Search warrants were executed on Lee's rental home but it was nowhere to be found. The court was told that seven months later a private investigator working for Lee delivered it to prosecutors in a box - there was no explanation why or how. In his defence Lee has hired Andrew Lankler, one of the top white collar criminal defense attorneys in New York. In his opening statement Mr Lankler said that the prosecution had been 'rushed' and that there were 'critical inconsistencies in the stories provided by the victim and the witnesses'. He said that the bathroom where the alleged rape happened was 12 feet from where the victim's brother and her friend were but that they did not hear a noise. He said that the facts were 'entirely consistent with the circumstances under which consensual sex occurs' but that it could have been 'perhaps regrettable consensual sex'. Before the allegation of rape the evening had been fun for all concerned and everyone had been taking pictures together, he said. Mr Lankler said: 'This is not a case that involves an allegation of rape in some back alley between people who are completely unknown to each other'. The trial continues."}

With a Steyr assault rifle pulled tight into his shoulder, the Prince is pictured taking part in exercises with Royal Australian Artillery troops in Darwin. Harry’s participation in the exercises follows his visit to the remote Kununurra region of Western Australia where he met village elders and children, camped in the Outback and was taught how to survive a bushfire. Scroll down for video . 'Delightful chap': Prince Harry takes time out from his tough training programme to play with local children at the Wuggubun community in a remote area hundreds of miles away from the nearest city, Darwin . As well as demonstrating his weapons handling and first aid skills, the 30-year-old took to the air in the Royal Australian Air Force’s Tiger assault helicopter, which is similar to the Apache the Prince flew in combat sorties against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2012. At the end of the exercises in the Northern Territory, Prince Harry will hang up his fatigues and, after attending official functions in Perth and Sydney, is expected to return to Britain. In July, the Prince is scheduled to spend several weeks on a conservation project in Africa before finally deciding on a fulltime job, most probably in the charity or public service sectors. Harry may choose to continue his work with the MoD’s Recovery Capability Programme, which helps wounded troops rebuild their lives and find new jobs. A source close to the Prince said his employment options were ‘wide and varied’ but he will not have to do Royal duties on a full-time basis. Put through his paces: The Prince patrols during Exercise Thunder Observer, a Joint Fire Team exercise with the 8th/12th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, at Robertson Barracks in Darwin, Northern Territory . Bowing out: Prince Harry started his army career in 2005 when he began training at Sandhurst, and has completed two tours of Afghanistan . Harry, affectionately dubbed Captain Wales by his fellow soldiers, has completed the first two weeks of a month-long attachment with the Australian 1st Brigade - but he is due to leave the British military in June after 10 years' service . Harry has been participating in day-to-day soldiering activities and physical training sessions as well as undertaking flight simulation training. His itinerary also included time in an armed reconnaissance helicopter. After meeting with some of the army's wounded, injured and ill members, the royal joined in a game of wheelchair Australian Football League with soldiers from the recovery centre and the 1st Brigade. During his time in the Kununurra region he was briefed on operations and trained in bush survival lessons, including how to source food and water. After receiving his orders, Harry headed out on patrol with members of the force, spending two nights camping out in the remote outback. His attachment with the Australian Defence Force will continue after Gallipoli commemorations in Turkey, when he will return to Australia to spend time with Australian Army units in Perth and Sydney.

Prince Harry spent his first day on the placement paying his respects at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Canberra before reporting for duty. He also found time to meet some of the locals and hit the headlines when he revealed his true feelings about selfie photos. 'Selfies are bad,' he said, when asked to strike a pose by a teenage fan. He added: 'I know you're young but just take a normal photograph.' He will also briefly travel back to Europe for a visit to Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales later this month where he will take part in a memorial service for the men who fought and died at Gallipoli. Striking a pose: Prince Harry poses with members of the local community, including Mr Trust. Locals described him as a 'delightful chap' Warm welcome: Prince Harry arrived in Australia earlier this month for his four week-long secondment . Agreed! He struck a pose next to a Redheads Rule sign but refused to pose for a selfie. He was visiting the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . The World War I battle, which pitted British forces against the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives of 34,000 British soldiers, 8,700 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Harry has served with the Australian Armed Forces in the past, most notably during his two tours of Afghanistan. 'He met [Australian troops] during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,' said an aide. 'Those experiences reinforced the huge admiration and respect he already had for Australian servicemen and women and has stoked his enthusiasm even more to build on those relationships in the next four weeks. 'He knows he will learn a huge amount from his Australian colleagues during this attachment and he is grateful to the ADF for producing such a varied and interesting programme for him. Saying hello: Harry's winning ways have endeared him to Australian locals from the start . All smiles: His first act upon arriving in Australia was to visit the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Clown Prince! He was happy to pull funny faces for the amusement of one little girl while meeting wellwishers . 'He is also looking forward to learning how wounded, injured and ill servicemen and women are supported here in Australia and hopes to pass on some of his experience from his current role in the UK. 'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.' Harry entered military service in 2005, training at The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as an officer cadet and was commissioned as an Army officer on Wednesday, 12th April 2006. He then joined the the Blues and Royals, and in early 2007 began secretly serving in the Helmand region of Afghanistan before his deployment was uncovered by an American newspaper, and he was brought back home. He was promoted to Captain, his current rank, in 2011 when he also went to America to learn to fly an Apache helicopter, before returning to fly missions in Afghanistan between September 2012 and January 2013."}

In a bold pitch to working class voters, the Prime Minister said the Tories would offer discounts of up to 70 per cent to  1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home. But the National Housing Federation said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers £5.8billion and was effectively worth £100,000 to each family who benefited. Scroll down for video . Thatcher's plan: Prime Minister David Cameron will announce an extension of the right-to-buy scheme which will allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home . The Chartered Institute of Housing, meanwhile, said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis - and could even make it worse by cutting the number of low-cost social homes available for poor families. Labour jumped on the remarks this morning, claiming the policy had 'unravelled' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off – raising £100million, or 2 per cent of the funds promised by the Tories. But the Home Secretary Theresa May defended the policy on the BBC this morning – insisting it was affordable and would give families the opportunity  to live in a home that they owned. She said: 'It is a very important policy because it shows what sort of government a Conservative government would be. It shows that we're a government that's on the side of working people who want to get on a build a better future for themselves and their families.' Unveiling the Conservative manifesto this morning, Mr Cameron declared the 'dream of a property-owning democracy is alive'. He said: 'The next Conservative government will extend the right-to-buy to all housing association tenants in this country – 1.3million extra families – a new generation given the security of a home of their own.' Original plan: The right-to-buy scheme became Lady Thatcher's most famous single policy . The pledge to extend right-to-buy, which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by Labour in Wales and the SNP in Scotland, will delight the Tory faithful, who were buoyed last night by a six-point poll lead over Labour. But the policy was branded 'deeply unfair' by housing associations and industry experts today. National Housing Federation director Ruth Davison said the extension of Right to Buy to housing association properties was 'the wrong solution to our housing crisis'. She said: 'A very conservative estimate of this policy puts the cost to the taxpayer of at least £5.8billion. 'Following 40 years of successive governments' failure to build the homes the country needs, soaring rents and house prices and the biggest baby boom since the 1950s, ensuring that there enough homes today and tomorrow must be our nation's top priority.' She added: 'Halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis, if you had £20 billion of taxpayers' money, would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents?' Gavin Smart, deputy chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis. He said: 'In fact it could make things worse for people on lower incomes who are already struggling to access a decent home at a price they can afford. 'Individual tenants might benefit from the opportunity to own a home, but we would be very concerned that it would result in a dramatic loss of vital social and affordable housing. 'The Conservatives say that forcing councils to sell off their most valuable properties would fund this extension plus 400,000 new homes over five years – we fear the figures simply won't stack up.' Samantha Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne listen to Prime Minister David Cameron as he unveils the Conservative party manifesto in Swindon this morning . He added: 'And it could have a huge impact on councils' ability to build new homes, particularly in more expensive areas like London and the south east, where it might actually make more sense for them to borrow against the value of these properties so they can fund more homes.' Senior Tory figures, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and David Davis, have been calling for the measure to be at the heart of the party's manifesto. The original right-to-buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates. Leading to a surge in home ownership, it became Lady Thatcher's most famous single policy. Labour's shadow housing minister attacked the Tory policy today . The Coalition government has already increased right-to-buy discounts for council homes, meaning more are moving into the private sector. But most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations – not-for-profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing – do not qualify. Enabling them to buy their homes is expected to require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act, and is likely to be fiercely opposed by housing associations themselves. As well as promoting home ownership, the scheme could also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill. Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties. The 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people. Mr Cameron said: 'At the heart of this manifesto is a simple proposition. We are the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your life. 'If you're a young person looking for training, if you're looking for a decent job, if you want to buy your own home, if you're raising a family and need help with childcare, if you fall ill, and need to rely on our NHS, if you are reaching retirement, and want real security. We are there for you – offering security at every stage of your life.' Some Labour figures, including former welfare minister Frank Field and former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, have previously championed the idea of extending the right-to-buy to housing associations. How does right-to-buy work? Introduced in 1980, it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home. Labour dropped its opposition to the policy but, in 1999, Tony Blair's government cut the top discount from £50,000 to £38,000 and sales slowed. What has the Coalition done? It has sought to reinvigorate the scheme, cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £77,000 for most areas. Are housing association tenants covered? Housing associations – autonomous, not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes – are largely exempt. However, around 800,000 HA tenants have a limited 'right to acquire' with discounts capped at between £9,000 to £16,000. The other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy. What are the Tory proposals? They would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right-to-buy. Tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount, increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant. Those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount, going up 2 per cent every year. Discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £102,700 in London and £77,000 across the rest of England. How will this be paid for? The Tories say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant. Council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off. Around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year, because tenants die or move. The sell-off could net £4.5billion a year. What about the proceeds? They will be split, with a proportion used to replace on a 'one-to-one' basis the council homes sold off. The new properties would be more affordable, probably in less expensive locations, and could be built either by a council or housing association. Another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right-to-buy discounts for housing association tenants. The rest would go to create a £1billion fund, enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing. It would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land, and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years, Tories say."}

But until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose. The second I see the word ‘spicy’ on a bottle label (which suggests an oaky flavouring), I instantly know the price will be much higher. A £5 bottle has suddenly become £12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling. So when I read this week about a new gadget that claims to be able to ‘oak age’ wine in hours rather than years, my curiosity was seriously roused. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour — a process that can take up to two years — in just a day or two. Who wouldn’t drink to that? Scroll down for video . TV wine expert Oz Clarke puts to the test this oak bottle that claims to 'oak age' wine in hours rather than years . The product, which retails at £50, is the brainchild of 30-year-old entrepreneur Joel Paglione. Growing up on his parents’ vineyard in Canada, Joel became fascinated by the process of ageing wine. Watching his dad painstakingly filling small barrels of wine for oaking, he wondered why the wine couldn’t be stored in the same huge vats that had been used to ferment it. When Mr Paglione Snr explained that the smaller the oak barrel, the faster the oak infusion, Joel got his Eureka moment. How about a bottle made out of oak which will ‘oak age’ a single bottle in a fraction of the time? Now, after three years of experimenting, Joel has developed what he claims is the ‘smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made.’ The idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle, leave for up to 48 hours (depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy) and — hey presto! — your supermarket bottle of plonk fresh from last year’s grape harvest should suddenly taste like a posh wine from a world-class vineyard that has had years to mature and develop oaky flavours. Ageing a wine overnight is the holy grail of wine lovers. It’s like finding the elixir of eternal youth — in reverse. But can a simple gizmo really mimic such a time-honoured process? Can I turn a cheap plonk into a lovingly aged wine? I’m eager to try. When it arrives, the Oak Bottle looks like a wooden version of the thermos flask I take on picnics. It’s plain and reassuringly sturdy. For my test I choose a Bulgarian Merlot (Simply Merlot, Tesco £4.20). It’s an unpretentious, fruity wine, great for glugging, but it’s hardly stellar quality. However, as with the French wines such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, Argentinian Melbecs, Australian Shirazes and, of course, the Spanish Rioja, once you add oak to a Merlot you are entering a whole new world — and price bracket. Merlots benefit hugely from being oak aged. I’m itching to start my test. But first I have to fill the Oak Bottle with water. Oak shrinks when dried out, so the instructions warn me the Oak Bottle is inclined to leak until it is sealed using lukewarm water to swell and close up any open wood grain. Sure enough, water drips out over the next two hours — enough to saturate the kitchen towel I put underneath. Eventually, the wood ready and the drips stop. Now I can start. I pour out the water, decant my Merlot, pop the stopper on and wait. Joel suggests the whole process can take anything from 24 to 48 hours. That’s a drop in the ocean compared to the 12-to-18 month ageing process in a proper barrel. The Celts weren’t wine drinkers but apparently were the first to use oak barrels to store and transport their beer and mead. The wine-loving Romans leapt at the invention — they were sick of their ceramic jugs crashing and breaking on long sea voyages. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour . They quickly discovered the wooden barrels not only added flavours to the wine but, because wood is porous, also allowed air (specifically, what we know as oxygen) to permeate the contents slowly, removing harsh flavours. In fact, that’s the other reason we pay such a premium for barrel-aged wines — the oxygen changes the molecules in the wine, sweetens the acids, softens the bitter bits and lets the tannins (or sediment) drop to the bottom, giving it a gorgeous rich mellowness. Great European winemakers have been using the same technique ever since. It’s still all done by hand. Barrels, which hold up to 300 bottles of wine, can cost well over £1,000, with the price determined by the quality of the oak that’s been used and the skill of the cooper making them. While the overwhelming aroma you get from oak is vanilla, if the wood is toasted a bit over a fire, you also get nutty flavours of hazelnuts and almonds. Toast even longer and you add chocolatey flavours and, later, coffee and burnt toast. The skill of the winemaker is deciding just how much flavour he wants in his barrel. All these flavours infuse the wine. And it takes months. Can the Oak Bottle — which apparently has a ‘medium toast’ flavour — do the same in just one day? And, just as important — can it turn a young fruity wine into a vintage quaff? If it can, I’ll be the first to splash out £50. The length of time you leave your wine in the Oak Bottle depends how oaky you like it — but it’s advisable to sample the contents regularly. Therefore, 14 hours into the experiment, I decide to see how the magic is working. Pulling out the stopper, sadly, has none of the heady satisfaction of uncorking a bottle. But I’m prepared to overlook the disappointment if the taste is right. As I take my first sniff, I immediately get a delicious aroma of vanilla. My spirits rise, but after the first sip they crash. It’s wine — with a hint of furniture polish. Even though the wine has been in the Oak Bottle for less than 24 hours, the taste of wood is overpowering. All the natural freshness of the fruity young Merlot has disappeared. I feel like I’m licking a plank of wood. Oz Clarke said the Oak Bottle is a fun product that would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff . In a traditionally oak-aged wine, the woody flavours would integrate over many months to give a rich, mellow taste. But this has been forced. This might be remedied by leaving the wine in the bottle for less time. In fact, the Oak Bottle’s developers say you can taste the wine every hour until you reach a level of oakiness appropriate for that particular bottle. I also think the Oak Bottle might actually improve the more times you use it. With each use, I imagine the strong oak flavour will fade. This is because alcohol, which is solvent, dissolves the flavours from inside the bottle. The Oak Bottle is the result of three years of experiments . For example, in winemaking a producer might empty his oak barrel after 18 months. At this point some 80 per cent of the flavours created by the barrel will have disappeared. Reuse the barrel, and there should be only 20 per cent of the oak-lined flavour left. By the third time you use the barrel, you might only have 5 per cent of the original flavour. I suspect it will be the same with the Oak Bottle, so those overpowering notes of beeswax furniture polish would mellow. The Oak Bottle is a fun product, and would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff. But there is another trick you can use to improve wine. Simply open your bottle of wine, pour half a glass, screw the top back on (or put in a stopper) and give the bottle a good shake. This forces oxygen into the wine, loosening the flavours and making it more drinkable. Leave for five minutes before you enjoy. Perfect — and it won’t cost you a penny."}

When Yulia was 27, she decided to research alternative options to battle her chronic tiredness, fertility problems, dry skin, dark circles and deep depression. She said: 'I read up on the benefits of being vegan. I had such a desire to become pregnant, but experienced issues. I was heavily depressed and suffered from chronic tiredness. 'Suddenly my life started to change when Paul and I became completely vegan. We threw ourselves into it and started working out twice a day.' Yulia, at 31.5 weeks pregnant, moved to the Indonesian island of Bali in 2009 with her husband to set up a healthy life-coaching business .

Life coach Yulia stuck to a vegan diet consisting of massive quantities of fruit, vegetables and juice . 'I would never advise anyone to stay vegan during pregnancy, it's not only about you - it's about the baby. 'You obviously don’t need to eat twice as much - don’t eat for two! - around 300 extra calories is fine, but you need quality protein, which is hard to get on a vegan diet. 'As a vegan (pregnant or not), you must really know your stuff. 'It's important to combine proteins to get all of the amino acids. You also need vitamins, including B12, which you can only get from animal sources; without good quality B12 you may have a baby with poor immunity. 'There are no vegan sources of B12, so they would need supplementation. 'Then there’s essential fatty acids such as omega 3, which is found in animal sources (or masses of seaweed). 'On the plus side, vegans have a lot of green leafy vegetables, which are packed with iron, folic acid and calcium, which are all great during pregnancy.' On top of her healthy diet, she endured hours of running, cycling and lifting weights . As Dr PhD Marilyn Glenville (www.marilynglenville.com) explains: 'Eating healthily means eating regular meals of freshly prepared whole foods. Buy organically grown produce wherever possible as this reduces the toxic load on the body. Eat a good proportion of raw fruits and vegetables. Do not eat raw meat or raw fish. Steam rather than boil, stir fry rather than deep fry and grill or stew rather than roast or fry. Make sure your diet is balanced with adequate protein, complex carbohydrates and high in essential fats but low in saturated fats and drink plenty of filtered or mineral water.' Foods to include . • Complex Carbohydrates Good sources: fresh fruit and vegetables (raw or lightly cooked), wholegrain breads, brown rice, wild rice, millet, oats, barley, buckwheat, rye and Quinoa. • Protein Good sources: Organic poultry (1 or 2 pieces per week), fish, goat milk, sheep milk, organic eggs, vegetarian cheese, nuts, soya, seeds and pulses. Some grains are better sources than others, for example Quinoa and millet; the rest have a small amount and should be combined with other protein sources. • Fats Good sources: Oily fish such as wild organic salmon, sardines, mackerel and herring. Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds, evening primrose oil, olive oil, hemp oil, starflower / borage oil and flax seed oil. • Water: Many of us do not drink enough water. It is thought to be essential in providing the medium in which many chemical reactions within the body take place. Sadly much of our tap water does not measure up to safety standards required. It is advisable to drink only bottled or filtered water whilst pregnant. • Fibre Good sources: Whole grains, fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds. You can also soak a tablespoon of whole linseeds in a glass of water overnight and swallow with an extra glass of water to help with the bowel."}

Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would not accept foreign interference in the country in a direct criticism of Tehran's backing of Shiite Houthi fighters. It comes as a Saudi-led coalition continues to pound anti-government forces in Yemen at the start of a third week of bombing. Scroll down for video . US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the US will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen . A member of the Saudi border guard is stationed at a look-out point on the Saudi-Yemeni border today. A Saudi-led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in Yemen . Mr Kerry told PBS television: 'There have been - there are, obviously - flights coming from Iran. Every single week there are flights from Iran and we've traced it and know this. 'Iran needs to recognise that the United States is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries in other countries.' The United States has backed the Saudi-led campaign, which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on Yemen's main southern city of Aden after seizing the capital Sanaa. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled Aden for Saudi Arabia during the Houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces. Riyadh has accused Tehran, the major Shiite power, of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting, which has cost more than 640 lives since March 19, according to the World Health Organization. Military force: Saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in southwestern Saudi Arabia . Patrol: Saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with Yemen . Mr Kerry, fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme, said Washington was not looking for confrontation with Tehran. 'But we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making.' In another sign of growing US support for the Saudi effort, the Pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition. The first refuelling flight took place on Tuesday night with a US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker providing fuel for a F-15 fighter jet operated by Saudi Arabia and an F-16 flown by the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's  framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal. And President Hassan Rouhani said separately that the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day'. 'What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' said Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state. After a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations, Tehran and the six powers agreed on April 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of June reining in Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 'Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,' Khamenei said, in his first comments on the deal. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . Playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of Iranian cities - Khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as 'there is nothing to take a stance on'. 'Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against.' Under the outline text agreed in the Swiss city of Lausanne between Tehran and the so-called P5+1 powers - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany - Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. 'I have always supported and still support the Iranian negotiating team,' Khamenei said. 'I welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation, but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged.' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day' He said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for Iran's future development. 'The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors,' he said. In a potential obstacle to any final deal, Rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement. 'We will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,' he said. The pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord. Western governments, which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the United Nations, have been pushing for it to happen only gradually. 'In return for Iran's future cooperation, we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted Iran's economy,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. Rouhani, who was speaking on Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme. 'We will have a tanker sortie every day,' Warren said, adding that all flights will be outside of Yemeni air space. The air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in Aden overnight Thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city, a source in pro-government forces told AFP. Air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern Shabwa province that was seized by the Houthis' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, a local official said. The official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to Saleh, who has been accused of joining with the Houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Yemen has been wracked by conflict since Saleh's ouster, with Hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions. Supporters of the Shiite Houthi militia brandish their weapons in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. Washington has said it will not accept foreign interference in the country . Conflict: Yemeni supporters of the southern seperatist movement fire towards Houthi rebels during clashes in the southern city of Aden yesterday . As well as the Houthis, who hail from Yemen's north, the government has struggled against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network's branches. Authorities in Yemen had for years allowed Washington to carry out a drone war against AQAP but US forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest. Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the Houthis. As the fighting and air campaign drag on, concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis. Some aid trickled in to Aden by ship on Wednesday but efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to organise flights of cargo planes into Sanaa have so far failed. In Aden, witnesses have said the situation is dire, with bodies lying in the streets and mosques calling through loudspeakers for help. Smoke and flames rise from Shiite Houthi rebel camps following an airstrike by the Saudi-led allianceearlier this week . A Yemeni child receives treatment at the burns unit of a hospital in Sanaa, following a reported airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition earlier this month . Diplomatic efforts have stepped up to resolve the conflict, with the Iranian and Pakistani foreign ministers pledging to work to find a negotiated solution. Zarif laid out a four-stage plan for talks, calling for an immediate ceasefire followed by humanitarian assistance, dialogue among Yemenis and the formation of an 'all-inclusive government'. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also quoted on Thursday as calling for a regional effort to end the fighting. 'The groups in Yemen should meet and work on possible solution. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran should be involved in efforts for a diplomatic solution,' Erdogan was quoted as saying by Turkish media."}

Susan Farmer, from Eddy, Texas, who weighs 43st (605 lbs), was told she would die unless she dropped more than half her body weight by concerned doctors. But while the 37 year old was determined to shed the weight, her mother continued to buy her daughter fatty foods. Scroll down for video . Susan Farmer, 37, from Eddy, Texas, weighs 43st (605lbs) and was told by doctors to lose half her body weight or face early death . At her heaviest, Susan weighed 43st and was unable to walk for longer than 30 seconds at a time. Speaking on the TLC show My 600lb Life, which aired at 9pm tonight, she reveals how the excess flab caused her permanent pain. She said: ‘Life is miserable, I hurt all the time.' ‘I don’t get up much with me having this big stomach, it pulls on me so bad and it feels like my skin is on fire and it’s just going to melt. ‘I have trouble breathing, especially when I’m walking and I have to take baby steps because I’m afraid of falling - if I fell, there’s nothing anybody can do for me. ‘I don’t like looking at myself so I don’t look at myself in the mirror - to me I’m fat and ugly.’ Susan regularly snacked on junk food all day to make herself feel happy . At 37 years old, Susan continues to live with her mother Nita, who dotes on her daughter and does all of her washing, cooking and cleaning. Although Nita admits that he daughter’s weight is putting her in serious danger, she appears unable to stop buying her the food that is making her fat. The pair are filmed visiting their local supermarket, where Susan says: ‘I don’t like going out much anymore. I only go out to get food or if I have to. ‘I can only walk now to get to the next place and sit down.’ After entering the store, Susan asks staff for an electric cart so she can sit on it as she browses the aisles, but is told that it is out of order. On hearing the news, she bursts into tears and says to her mother: ‘I can’t walk around this damn store. Can’t do it, I can’t walk around this f****** store.’ She heads to the nearest chair in the in-store café and sits down, refusing to move until her mother suggests putting the chair in the trolley and taking it round with them so that Susan can sit down when she needs to. But in the same breath, when Susan gets up to walk around the store, her mother asks her what type of cakes she wants to buy. In the supermarket, Susan is unable to walk for long periods of tie because of the pressure her weight puts on her knees . She is then seen piling large packets of nachos and multiple large bottles of full-fat coca cola into their shopping trolley. Back home, emotions reach breaking point and Susan is seen sobbing over how she is unable to look at herself. She says: ‘All l I see is a fat blob. I’m just disgusted at the way I look - I hate myself. ‘My weight is getting to a point where I can’t take care of myself anymore, I live with my mother and she has to take care of me most of the time.’ When the producers talk to Susan’s mother and sister it becomes clear that that a traumatic childhood was the root cause for her weight gain, but also that her mother Nita tried to make everything right in her daughter’s life by feeding her treats. Despite knowing she has an eating problem, Susan is seen piling junk food into her tolley . Nita says: ‘When Susan was about four or five years old, me and her dad started fighting a lot. ‘He was an alcoholic, he would come home drunk and somebody was going to get hit, either me or Susan. ‘When Susan would get upset, I went to the store. If she wanted candy or ice cream I’d go and buy it - food was her comfort, her way of escaping.’ The situation hit fever pitch when Susan was 17, her father came home drunk one day and started to shout at his wife, before pulling out a shotgun. Susan and her sister Stephanie stood in the middle of the pair and told their father that if he pulled the trigger, he’d end up shooting them – he left the house and her mother filed for divorce. Nita says: ‘Susan started putting on weight and she just hasn’t stopped. She just keeps getting bigger.’ In an effort to lose the pounds Susan and her mother and sister head to a hospital in Texas to try and find out if they is eligible for weight loss surgery. She is weighed for the first time in years and the scales clock in at 605 lbs. Susan is weighed at a hospital in Houston, Texas, and discovers she weights 605lbs . The Dr at the hospital tells her that she needs to lose at least 100lbs (7st) before it will be safe for her to be operated on. He tells the cameras that someone of her weight is at huge risk of respiratory failure if she goes under general anaesthetic. He adds that her mother needs to stop enabling her daughter’s food habit as it is shortening her life and recommends an extreme diet of no fat and no sugar, just fibre and protein over the next couple of months. Susan goes home and totally overhauls her diet, eating yoghurt for breakfast, eggs for lunch and salad with most meals. She also pushes herself to go outside walking around her house and reveals that after two months she is walking further than she has done in years without needing to sit down. They return to the hospital and she is told that she has lost 158lbs (11st) and now weighs 449.6 lbs (32st). Susan is approved for surgery for a gastric bypass and admitted to hospital. The surgery goes ahead successfully and Susan is told that she is expected to lose 30-40lbs in the next two months while she recuperates at home. She leaves with the use of a walking frame and head back to her home with her mother. Susan with her mother Nita, who admits she spoils her daughter too much . The next couple of months prove hard to Susan and she claims to have no strength in her legs – when she returns to the hospital to be weighed she has lost just 2lbs. She returns home under strict orders form the doctor to improve her weight loss but she collapses two weeks later and is rushed to hospital complaining of numbness in her legs. After several tests, a neurologist tells Susan that she has neuropathy – extensive nerve damage that comes from being heavily obese for an extended period of time. The symptoms are so severe that the Dr warns that she could be paralysed if she doesn’t get treatment immediately. She is admitted to rehab for a month where physiotherapists help to build up the strength in her legs. But after being discharged, her mother drives her straight to a drive-thru for some fast food. After undergoing gastric bypass surgery, Susan needs to use a walking aid . A month later she has gained 6lbs and admits to snacking on fatty foods, including chips and cupcakes. She says: ‘I cheat little but it helps me with everything going on. The key is finding balance, I just can’t overdo it.’ In an act of desperation, Susan visits a therapist to try and find out if the root cause of her inability to stop eating is her emotional damage from her childhood. During the therapy session, she asks her mother to stop babying her and allow her to cook and clean after herself. She says: ‘This is going to be hard, I’ve spent to long being dependent on others I’m afraid I can’t do it on my own, something always gives me an excuse not to. 'I just have to start doing it.' A month after the therapy visits Susan’s weight reaches 392 lbs (28st), a total loss of 215lbs (15st). Susan ends u back in hospital because of the damage her weight has done to the nerves in her legs . Susan moves out of her house and in with her brother. She does the chores around the house including the laundry, washing the dishes and tries to walk as much as possible without her walker. She says: I haven’t needed it as much as I thought. I’m slowly getting back my mobility. ‘I’ve lived so long telling myself I couldn’t’ take care of myself and living in fear and excuse. ‘For the first time in my life I feel like I’m an independent person, it has been a great feeling. ‘It feels like the whole world is opening up to me and I’m actually living life.’ After 11 months of filming she weighs 340lbs, a total weight loss of 267 lbs. She says: ‘You have to get to a place where you’re broken to be desperate enough to change.’"}

But Amelia-Jane Harris, 20, says her new 'dream body' is actually a nightmare, as Crohn's disease means she is in constant pain and cannot eat. The illness has seen Miss Harris lose more than 18 stone (252lbs) in 20 months, as she regularly vomits up her food and suffers excruciating bowel pain. At her largest, when she weighed 27st 10lbs (388lbs) and was a size 32, she dreamed of pulling off skimpy outfits. But now, weighing just 8st 9lbs (121lbs) and wearing size 6 clothes, she says she would give anything to get back her fuller figure back and be able to eat normally again. Scroll down for video . Amelia-Jane Harris, 20, used to weigh 27st 10lbs and was bullied at school and called 'Fatty Bum Bum' (left). She developed Crohn's disease and lost 18 stone in 20 months to become a slim size six (right). But rather than being delighted at her new figure, she describes her situation as a 'nightmare' Her condition leaves her in constant pain and she can barely keep food down, so she can never enjoy eating or go out for dinner with her friends. She so tired from being malnourished she cannot work, and her fingernails, eyebrows and hair all regularly fall out. Miss Harris, of Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, said: 'I get lots of compliments on my figure, but I have constant, underlying pain. 'Sometimes it feels like really severe stomach cramps, but I also get really bad stabbing pains that won't go away. 'I get no enjoyment out of food anymore. Eating feels like a chore because I know it's going to cause me pain. 'It seems pointless to make a healthy meal because I'll just throw it up. 'With strong painkillers I can cope, but it feels like a curse - I'm going to have to take this medication for the rest of my life.' Miss Harris was a happy and healthy child but her weight began to increase through her teens despite making no change to her diet. Miss Harris says her 'dream body' is actually a nightmare as she cannot eat and vomits daily . By the age of 14, she was dubbed 'Fatty Bum Bum' by playground bullies. She said: 'I ate whatever mum gave me, which was healthy because she was always watching her weight. 'As my waistline expanded, my confidence shrank and it wasn't until I left school - and the bullies - behind me that I stopped worrying about my size. 'At college, I ate what I wanted and although I reached nearly 28 stone, I still made an effort with my clothes, hair and make-up. Fat didn't have to mean ugly.' With the humiliation of her school days behind her, Miss Harris gradually started to embrace her size 32 frame. But then shortly after her 17th birthday, having finally made peace with being overweight, she fell seriously ill. She said: 'I started vomiting 10 times a day. I just couldn't keep anything down. 'Within 20 months I'd lost more than 18st. It didn't make any sense to me and I was terrified.' Concerned by the rapid and unprompted weight loss, she consulted her GP. In June 2014, after months of tests, her doctor diagnosed her with Crohn's disease, a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. There is currently no cure for Crohn's disease - treatment simply aims to relieve the symptoms of the digestive system becoming inflamed. Miss Harris was immediately prescribed a cocktail of pills, which she is required to take every day. She said: 'On a good day I have to take up to 70 pills, but it can go up to 100 on a bad one. 'The weight kept falling off until I reached size six. People congratulated me on the weight loss and told me I looked fabulous – but the truth was I'd never felt worse' She now weighs 8st 9lbs, which means she is very slim for her 5tf 7in height. She said: 'I'll never be big again. I can only keep down around 10 per cent of what I eat, and right now I'm even struggling to keep down water.' Before the sickness started, Miss Harris would tuck into a healthy bowl of cereal for breakfast. Before being diagnosed with Crohn's disease, Miss Harris had four jobs. Now, she is so tired she cannot work. She said: 'I know it sounds unbelievable, but I'd give anything to be 27 stone again' For lunch she'd have a salad or a sandwich, and dinner was a meal cooked by her mother, such as a healthy portion of spaghetti bolognese made with reduced fat Quorn mince. Now, her condition means she cannot eat fats or oils. She has not eaten junk food for the past three years and has been on a strict diet of boiled meat and vegetables. She said: 'I know it sounds unbelievable, but I'd give anything to be 27 stone again. This time last year I held down four jobs, but now I'm too ill to work. 'Being curvy is part of what it means to be a girl. I had that before, but now I just look like a boy.' 'My fingernails have been known to drop off because I'm not getting any nutrients. 'I've also suffered really badly with hair loss. I wore a wig for the entire summer of 2013, which was hot, itchy and just generally uncomfortable. 'I even lost my eyebrows, which made me look like an alien. 'I can't go out and eat with my mates because I'll be sick. 'In the past when I've lost weight on purpose and people complimented me, I felt proud. Now, when people say \"well done\", I feel nothing.' Alarmingly, her weight is still decreasing and doctors are still baffled as to why her weight has not stabilised. She said: 'There's talk about admitting me back to hospital, but I'd give anything to avoid that. 'To some, I have the dream body - but to me, my size six figure is nothing but a nightmare. I can only pray that the doctors find the answer soon.' For more information and support, visit www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk . Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system . Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system. Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness, swelling and pain. Crohn's causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a healthy way. The disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis. Crohn's is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition. Sufferers will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when their symptoms flare up or relapse. There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms. The cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to contribute. Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's. Symptoms include: . Abdominal pain and diarrhoeaTiredness and fatigueFeeling generally unwellMouth ulcersLoss of appetite and weight lossAnaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells . It's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the UK. It can start in any age, but usually appears for the first time between the ages of 10 and 40. The disease can cause complications including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever. Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK ."}

The Victorian building that houses it is built on the site of England’s first hospital for the mentally ill - the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, which opened in 1247 and was often pronounced as ‘bedlam’. Fast forward a few centuries and in its place is a swanky, celebrity-baiting boutique hotel with 267 rooms  - four of which have been decorated by trendy artists. And instead of mental health patients, it's the likes of Beyonce, Lil Kim and Lady Gaga that stay here these days. Silence is golden: Step into the Andaz Liverpool Street lobby and you're in a world of hushed swankery . Star guests: The likes of Lady Gaga (right) and Beyonce (left) are fans of the Andaz Liverpool Street . Historic: Andaz Liverpool Street is built on the site of England's first hospital for the mentally ill . The striking thing about walking into the lobby is just how serene it is. Despite its proximity to one of the country’s busiest railway stations and the frenetic Bishopsgate road, the foyer is a place of almost temple-like peacefulness, as if hermetically sealed from the outside. ‘Who turned off London?’ I ask my girlfriend as we walk in. The check-in system is very Apple Store. The foyer doesn’t have a reception, it has amiable youngsters swanning around with iPads, which you use to register. Our room on the third floor matches the foyer in the hushed stakes, with the traffic noise quite marvellously suppressed. Even emergency service sirens are little more than distant bleeps. The vibe in this Large King room is minimalist chic, with two distinctive red Eames chairs and a sleek wooden desk with Jacob Jacobsen lamp. But we’ve chosen it for a certain bespoke flourish, for this is one of four rooms in the Andaz which has been decorated by trendy artists. Our room has a gigantic mural created by Patrick Vale and Paul Davis called One Day Walk plastered across one of the walls. The three other ‘art rooms’ contain works by Chris Price and his wife and collaborator Delisia Howard, design studio ILoveDust and Patrick Morgan. Art of the matter: MailOnline stays in the Andaz's quirky One Day Walk room, which features a huge mural by Patrick Vale and Paul Davis . Big draw: Patrick Vale (right) and Paul Davis (left) put the finishing touches on their amazing One Day Walk picture . Creative: The Pearly Room - also king-sized - features a flamboyant piece of art by Chris Price . Easel does it: Internationally renowned British artist Patrick Morgan reveals his Andaz street art room - The Day The Flower Rose . Multi-disciplinary English Artists ILoveDust’s East My Dust street art room will also appeal to those who fancy a quirky twist to their stay . One Day Walk is a celebration of the hotel’s east side locale, documenting a nine-hour walk the artists took that began with breakfast at St John Bread And Wine and wound its way past St Paul’s Cathedral, Hawksmoor Church, Brick Lane and Columbia Road, of flower-market fame. It’s a jumble of sketches, ponderings and quotes from overheard conversations that some might find a bit overwhelming, but we find mesmerising. A work of art that adds a splash of attitude and intrigue to a room with low-key aesthetics. The room’s other major talking point is the bed. It’s simply magnificently huge and comfortable, seemingly spanning multiple postcodes. There’s a lot of floor space, too. I’m tempted to zig-zag my way to the bathroom to extract maximum value from it. Delightful design: The Andaz Liverpool Street features a knowing nod to New York's Guggenheim Museum . Suite deal: The Andaz also contains bigger rooms with a living-room set-up . There is also an iPod dock, which would have been spiffing… if we had iPods. The Andaz should really invest in some Bluetooth-capable sound systems as mobile phones tend to be the portable music system of choice these days. The aforementioned en-suite, meanwhile, is strikingly swish, with floor-to-ceiling tiling, a deep bath and turbo-charged power shower. Room inspection over, it’s time to explore the rest of the hotel. The Andaz has made the business of sauntering around inside all the more pleasant by dispersing a zesty fragrance through diffusers and, I'm told, courtesy of housekeeping staff armed with sprays. It's called 'Darjeeling' and was created specifically for the hotel by a company called T London, which claims it 'relaxes and renews'. This aroma wafts around rather pleasing aesthetics. The hotel opened as The Great Eastern in 1884 and was given a Terence ‘Habitat’ Conran makeover in 2000 after it had fallen into disrepair. The result is most eye-catching, with a postmodern, sleek interior contrasting markedly with the redbrick exterior. A highlight is the soaring six-storey-high atrium and a winning nod to the Guggenheim museum built into the 'spine' of the hotel that joins the old part with a newer section. Guests looking up as they walk to the lifts in the foyer will notice the walkways above have been sculpted to imitate the New York museum’s world-famous spiral design. Very clever. The refurb, meanwhile, revealed something rather intriguing and Dan Brown - a Greek Masonic Temple hidden behind a fake wall. Built using 12 types of Italian marble and mahogany panelling, it was considered one of the grandest Masonic temples of its time. Masons began using it again for meetings when it was uncovered and while it's not open to guests, this ornate room can be hired by the public, with wine tastings and wedding receptions popular bookings. Our appetite for the mysterious sated, it's time to dine. Mysterious: When the hotel was refurbished in 2000 builders found this incredible Masonic temple behind a fake wall. Today it is available for hire . Flaming brilliant: Once a month the Andaz hosts a candle-lit dinner in its 1901 restaurant . Tasty: The standard of cooking at the Andaz is stunning and the setting truly relaxing . Food, glorious food: The presentation of the dishes at 1901 is stunning. Pictured is a crab starter . Casual: Breakfast and brunch is served at the Andaz's Eastway cafe, where the atmosphere is more informal . Brute of a breakfast: The full English option at Eastway will satisfy the hungriest of customers . Dinner at the Andaz, in its 1901 restaurant, is truly an experience to savour. Feeding takes place in a space that’s almost other worldly, a grand high-ceilinged room containing huge Mount Olympus-style pillars, gigantic potted plants that only Hercules could lift and a central block brimming with cocktail-making juices, as one of side of the room functions as a bar. The setting is enhanced because it's 1901’s Candlelight Dinner night which takes place on the last Wednesday of every month. Three hundred and fifty candles are lit and placed around the room for added dreaminess. The food quality is equally impressive. It's so beautifully presented you could call it art, frame it and hang it. I savour a delicious crab starter with cucumber, grapefruit and blackberry jelly (£14) followed by a brilliantly executed beef fillet with potato cake, oxtail spring roll, stilton beignet, carrot and courgette puree (£29). A glass of 2006 Woodlands Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot from Australia complements it marvellously. Brunch the next day in the hotel's Eastway diner is far more casual, but memorable all the same. The DIY Bloody Mary bar there is a great idea, but I summon a revitalising oatmeal and banana smoothie and a dreadnought of an English breakfast served in a huge roll from an interesting and fun New York-style menu. It's delicious but I feel anchored to my seat, so it's time to abandon the tranquillity of the Andaz and follow in the footsteps of Vale and Davis through the streets of the East End to walk it off.

Or how a hotel handles it if a guest dies during their stay? Hotel industry insider turned author Jacob Tomsky shares his tales from working in two top hotels in New Orleans and New York City and provides lots of little-known tips to ensure guests make the most of every hotel stay. MailOnline Travel chatted with Tomsky to get the answers to some of our most burning hotel questions... Scroll down for video . Hotel industry insider turned author, Jacob Tomsky, reveals the most common items people take from hotels . What are some of the most common items that people take from hotels? Without a doubt, toiletries and towels are definitely the most popular items for guests to pocket, according to Jacob Tomsky, author of Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality. But some individuals staying at the hotel take things a bit too far. 'They take everything,' he tells MailOnline Travel. 'Duvet covers, little silver trashcans, universal remotes - anything that's not nailed down.' Despite common misconceptions, it is possible to pocket a plush robe - without incurring any charges . What can you usually get away with taking? Despite common misconceptions, you actually can get away with stealing that coveted hotel room robe. 'If you were to, say, check into a room, take a fresh robe and pack it away in your suitcase, then call down and say your room didn't have a robe in it when you checked in, is the hotel staff going to search your belongings? Highly unlikely,' Tomsky reveals. And when it comes to pocketing toiletries, you can occasionally even ask for more. 'There are other items, as well - complimentary amenities that you may not be aware are available,' he explains. 'Good hotels keep extra items, such as slippers, razors and shaving cream, travel lint rollers, and mini-deodorants, in stock but not displayed in the room.' As it turns out, the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel, full of items 'sold at an absurd mark-up' If you lie about using the minibar, will the hotel really charge you? 'The minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel,' Tomsky tells MailOnline Travel. 'Human error, over-stocking, failure to re-stock, errant charges from weighted items being shifted but not consumed, all of these lead the front desk to spend hours a day slicing off incorrect charges.' He also notes that the 'items are purchased in bulk and sold at an absurd mark-up.' 'Hotels are much more concerned with your overall experience and securing further room nights - the main revenue stream - than whether or not you ate a candy bar.' Mike Holovacs, a front office supervisor at a major hotel chain and an adjunct hospitality instructor, adds: 'If an item has not sold, it's just like any other retail setting - the item is pulled when it reaches its expiration date.' Because certain rooms have varying levels of cleaning difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' How long does it take to clean a hotel room? Is there anything that typically does not get cleaned? The length of cleaning time generally depends on the room. Because rooms have varying levels of difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' and housekeepers must clean a certain total of points in one day. This may translate to a few larger suites or simply multiple standard rooms. 'I'd guess the average time is between 30 minutes to an hour to flip the room,' Tomsky estimates. 'A great deal of that time discrepancy depends on how the guest has left the room.' Once a year, large sections of rooms, or even entire floors are pulled out of service for maintenance and deep cleaning. 'This is includes sending the draperies out for cleaning and shampooing the carpets,' Holovacs explains. However, minibar glasses are often cleaned less thoroughly, usually soaked in shampoo or furniture polish . When it comes to the items that are cleaned less frequently or less thoroughly? Minibar glasses and the remote control. 'Housekeepers are usually responsible for cleaning the glasses, yet are not provided with dish soap,' he explains. 'So they either soak them in the sink with shampoo or, in a pinch, use furniture polish, as it leaves a 'clean-looking' shine.' And have you ever tried to clean your own remote? 'The rubbery buttons make it near impossible and dousing it with a cleaning agent could damage the circuitry,' Tomsky adds. How much money hotels spend on toiletries generally depends on the scale of the property and its occupancy . How much do hotels generally spend on toiletries per year? This one has everything to do with the scale of the property and its occupancy. According to a recent Forbes article, the Marriott hotel chain will spend approximately $20 million annually on their Thann products, a natural skincare line that's stocked in their Americas and Asia Pacific hotels. 'Usually the ordering is done by a housekeeping manager who takes into account the current supply and the average monthly uses from years past,' Tomsky reveals. 'People use more toiletries in the winter, have longer showers, and go through more toilet paper. 'It's a rather intriguing ordering process based on a large amount of collected data. 'And, ultimately, you don't want to be the one who fails to order enough toilet paper for the entire hotel.' Though there's a belief that hotel staffer furnish their home with amenities, Tomsky says it's not often the case . And do staff ever get to take them home? 'There's a long history of hotel staffers semi-furnishing their own home with hotel amenities,' Tomsky admits. 'Every party I threw from 2001 to 2004 was catered with hotel pillow chocolates. 'For the most part, items are either so pre-used that to take them would be distasteful, or so expensive that to steal them wouldn't be worth the loss of one's job. 'But I do have shoe polish that I've never paid for and hotel-branded slippers to keep me comfy in the wintertime.' One charity has come up with a novel way to deal with leftover hotel soaps - churning them together to provide soap to those in developing countries. Clean The World, receives partially-used and discarded soap from hotels, recycles it into millions of new bars, and then works with partner Global Soap to strategically distribute the new soap to people who lack access to it around the world. People dying in their hotel room is not quite as rare of an occurrence as guests may think, Tomsky admits . What happens if someone dies in a hotel room? While a bit morbid to talk about, Tomsky admits that such an occurrence is not quite as rare as guests may think. 'It's not something a hotel wishes to publicise, naturally,' he explains. 'So, they are removed as discreetly as possible. 'This may involve flashing lights and paramedics, depending on the severity of the situation, but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits.' Afterwards, the room is sanitised, cleaned, 'flipped' and sold - and that can happen a lot faster than you'd think. And, of course, all hotel staffers are forbidden from revealing any details - including cause of death and room numbers - to anyone. 'Death is a part of hotel life,' Tomsky adds. 'In fact, suicides often prefer hotels, relieving loved ones of the cleaning duties or seeing the deceased in a disturbing way.' Guests should take comfort in knowing that their in-room safes are actually very secure . Do staff actually have access to the in-room safes? No, they do not. The safes truly are, you know, safe. 'I always recommend using the safe to every traveller,' Tomsky says. 'The only person who can open the safe, should you forget your password, is a manager from the security department, using a tool that only they are trained and authorised to use.' What really happens to that half-used roll of loo paper in hotel room bathrooms? Well, it depends... And finally, what happens to the half-used loo roll in hotel room bathrooms? There's a bit of dispute over this one, and again, a lot of times it depends on the hotel itself. In the spirit of being environmentally-minded, most chains will simply refold the paper and leave the half-used roll in the bathroom, with another full roll behind it, should the guest run out. If there's not enough left to warrant leaving it, a Quora thread user, who works for the Beechmont Hotels Corporation, believes that the nearly-used up roll most likely winds up on housekeeping carts for when a room attendant needs a tissue for other cleaning tasks or in employee bathrooms."}

After angering locals with an initial proposal, the developer has now submitted fresh plans to demolish the John Nash-designed Park Crescent West and rebuild it as apartments. The crescent's facade will look near-on identical to its current design, but residents who live behind the site are furious at the proposals, claiming years of noise and disruption will ruin their lives. Fresh start: Park Crescent West, next to Regents Park in London,  could be demolished and re-built again under controversial plans which have angered nearby residents worried about noise and disruption . How it could look: Controversial plans for houses behind Park Crescent West (pictured) have been unveiled by property developer PCW Property Holdings. The development would be made up of 73 homes in total . PCW Property Holdings paid £105million for the crescent in 2013. The new development will be made up of 73 homes, ranging from studios and mews houses to five-bed flats worth £15million. With around 183,000 sq/ft of accommodation, any completed development is set to be worth in excess of £500million. Carlo Seidel, who is representing residents, yesterday said 'an overwhelming number' of people were against it. He said: 'There are a lot of elderly people living here and a number who aren't healthy. They do not want the development to go ahead. Opposition: Modern flats next to the planned development (pictured) where residents are objecting to the proposal to demolish a Grade I listed crescent designed by the architect of Buckingham Palace . The vision: After angering locals with an initial proposal, the developer has now submitted fresh plans (pictured) to demolish the John Nash-designed crescent and rebuild it as ultra-posh apartments . A big deal: With around 183,000 sq/ft of accommodation, any completed development in place of Park Crescent West, near Regents Park in London, is set to be worth in excess of £500million . A glimpse into the past: How Park Crescent West looked in the early 1900s. It was designed by Buckingham Palace architect John Nash . 'This is a complicated project and there will be massive disruption. People are upset. 'It is at the expense of longstanding London residents who are expected to put up with years of misery and mess without any compensation, for the sake of the developer's profit.' Mr Seidel added: 'Residents are conscious that developments have to happen from time to time but they feel that they ought to be appropriately compensated for being caught up in one. 'It is probably going to take around five years and some of the elderly people are saying they won't be alive for another five years. 'If this is going to happen they are going to need decent compensation so they can move while any work takes place.' The crescent was originally designed by John Nash in the early 19th century to be grand houses for the friends and family of the Prince Regent. In the pipeline: The revamp will be made up of 73 homes, ranging from studios and mews houses to five-bed flats worth £15million. Residents fear the work could take around five years to complete . Bombed: What the crescent looked like in the early 1950s after being partially destroyed in the Second World War. The Grade I listed terrace was restored in 1960 and replaced with offices and residential accommodation . Nash, who designed Buckingham Palace, wanted a full circus, but only a semi-circle was ever built and a large amount was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The crescent was restored in 1960 and replaced with offices and residential accommodation. Developers want to replace the facade of the Grade I listed crescent, which is a 'flawed modern copy' of the original work by Nash. The proposals are to remove it and build a more historically correct and accurate replacement. There were plans to build 80 homes, but the developers had to revise their proposals after discovering an 18th century ice house beneath the road and parking bays. Fresh plans, consisting of almost 150 documents, were submitted to Westminster Council last week. John Nash, remembered for his work on Buckingham Palace, Regent's Park and Regent Street in London, is one of the most famous architects of the 18th and early 19th centuries. He was born in January 1752 and after an early education received training from the architect Sir Robert Taylor. After early education, Nash was trained by the architect Sir Robert Taylor and worked as a surveyor and builder in the city of London. In 1777 Nash established his own business and later inherited £1,000 from an uncle which he decided to risk on the building of houses in Great Russell Street and Bloomsbury Square. The buildings failed to rent out and Nash was declared bankrupt in 1783. Returning to London in 1797, Nash then designed a number of Gothic castles around the country, in places such as Luscombe Castle in Devon and Caerahays Castle in Cornwall. Nash  soon came under the patronage of the Prince Regent, later King George IV. In 1806 he was appointed Surveyor General of Woods, Forests and Parks and from 1810 onwards worked solely for the prince. By 1813 he had been appointed official architect to the Office of Works, which meant advising parliamentary commissions on things such as new church buildings. This was when he designed Regent's Park, Buckingham Palace and two theatres in Haymarket. When George IV died in 1830, Nash lost his royal protector amid a backlash about the extravagance of the King's reign. Buckingham Palace had cost thousands, millions in today's terms, and Nash ultimately retired. He died a few years later in May 1835. Architect: John Nash (pictured left), who designed Buckingham Palace, wanted a full circus but only a semi-circle crescent was ever built, where scientist and inventor Sir Charles Wheatstone (right) once lived . Landscaping: What the gardens could look like under the landscaping scheme for Park Crescent West. A raise pool with seating is included . But despite the anger from residents, there is support from people working in the property industry while Westminster Council would receive around £5million from the developers for affordable housing. Becky Fatemi, managing director of luxury estate agent Rokstone, believes it is an 'exciting new plan' which will help boost the area. She said: 'Over the last five years the regeneration of Marylebone and new super-prime resi projects in Regents Park such as the new mansions at Cornwall Terrace have totally transformed the perception of the park and its surrounding properties. Builders at the Park Crescent West site.

There were plans to build 80 homes, but the developers had to revise their proposals after discovering an 18th century ice house beneath the road and parking bays . Around 200 people living in flats (pictured) that back onto Park Crescent West, many of whom are elderly, are opposed to fresh plans, consisting of almost 150 documents, submitted to Westminster Council last week . Unhappy: Carlo Seidel (right), who is representing angry residents, said 'an overwhelming number' of locals were opposed to the plans for Park Crescent (left). He claimed the project would cause 'massive disruption' 'Oil royals, wealthy Russians and Ukrainian commodity billionaires plus celebrities such as Tom Ford have all moved into homes around Regents Park and the location has become totally transformed into a highly sought after luxury village. 'The buyers will be people looking for homes in and around Marylebone and Regents Park who want lateral space and like the Regency aesthetic.' Ms Fatemi added: 'Modern schemes nearby such as The Chilterns and Chiltern Place are superb, but not everyone likes ultra modern developments. 'Period facade projects like Park Crescent and Cornwall Terrace appeal to another market who like opulent period architecture homes with luxury new specification features. 'This market is very popular with Middle East, Russian and Eastern European buyers, and it also attracts City brokers wanting a luxury London home.'"}

Californian Joshua Corbett faces charges of stalking and burglary this week after allegedly breaking into actress Sandra Bullock's home last summer. Terrified Sandra, 50, who was in her property at the time, was forced to make a desperate call to the police having locked herself in a cupboard. Scroll down for video . Sandra Bullock was horrified when she discovered that Joshua Corbett had broken into her house last summer . In the disturbing voice clip released byTMZ - which was played to the court as Corbett stands trail - the audibly panicked Oscar winner is heard telling the police that she is hiding in her closet. She is heard saying: 'I'm in my closet. I have a safe door. I'm locked in the closet right now.' Corbett has pleaded not guilty to the charges bought against him. Corbett broke into the house on 8 June last year brandishing a love letter for the actress. In the clip Sandra can be heard saying that she had seen him making his way up to her attic. The judge read out a section of the note which Corbett had been carrying in a black notepad which said: 'You are so hot and intelligent and lithesome and taut.' Corbett, who was found in Sandra's home clutching a love letter for the actress, has pleaded not guilty to the charges bought against him . Corbett's defense lawyer Paul Takakijan said: 'The love letter that Corbett carried with him professed nothing but love and admiration. 'There is nothing in there about harming her. The people are trying to make more of the case than there is.' Corbett also is charged with having an arsenal of illegal weapons, including assault weapons, tracer ammunition and machine guns, that were found when authorities searched his home in Montrose, California. Corbett was not armed when he was arrested at Bullock's residence, police have said. Unfortunately Sandra is not the first person to experience a celebrity stalker. A-listers such as Madonna, Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber have also been plagued by the experience. Here FEMAIL lists some of the worst offenders... Kim was stalked by a man named Dennis Shaun Bowman who would show up to events with a jokers mask painted on his face . Kim Kardashian: Dennis Shaun Bowman .

Justin Bieber was the subject of a murder plot by two convicted criminals until one of them turned himself in . Justin Bieber: Dana Martin . Justin's terrifying stalker Dana Martin was already a convicted rapist and killer when he decided to target the pop star. Along with his fellow inmate at the Las Cruces state prison in New Mexico, Mark Staake, he plotted to kill Justin, enlisting the help of Staake's nephew to carry out the plot. Dana Martin - who was already a convicted rapist and murderer - planned to kill Justin Bieber but he turned himself in before going through with the plan . The plan was that he would travel to New York to murder Justin but Dana turned himself in before they went through with it. It is thought the inmate was fanatically obsessed with the young singer and even had a tattoo of him on his leg.

A group of Eritrean refugees told how they were forced to deny their faith or face death at the hands of Islamist gunmen who patrol the towns and beaches of the North African state searching for 'infidels'. Haben, 19, told MailOnline: 'We are Christians but we had to deny our faith otherwise the gunmen would kill us, slit our throats and cut off our heads.' He and his brother Samuel, 14, arrived in Sicily a week ago, just days before around 900 people died when their boat capsized during the same dangerous journey from Libya - one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. Scroll down for video . Migrants: Eritrean refugees Haben (left) and his younger brother Samuel made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to escape beheading from Islamic State fanatics . Haben said his friends had been shot dead by armed ISIS terrorists who patrol the anarchy-ridden towns and beaches of the country. He told MailOnline: 'I have friends - from Eritrea and Egypt - who were killed because they are Christians. 'The men come around with Kalashnikov and they ask you what is your faith. 'If you are Christian they take you away and kill you. They cut off your head or shoot you. This is what they have done to hundreds of Christians.' Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists  take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country. With ISIS having established strongholds in the towns on Sirte and Derna, and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country, fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical Islamists is driving the desperate migrants to leave Libya as quickly as they can, dangerously overloading vessels. Only yesterday, Ethiopian officials revealed that the 30 Christians filmed being beheaded and shot by Islamic State militants in Libya were likely to have been desperate migrants trying to reach Europe and even Britain. The 29-minute video released on Sunday is titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', and shows dozens of militants butchering two separate groups of men in the north African country. (l-r) Haben, Aman, Tesfalem and Samuel set off on the perilous sea journey across the Med Sea last week .

Local residents and rescue workers help a woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Rhodes, southeastern Greece yesterday . Haben and his brother Samuel, 14,  risked their lives in hope of a brighter future in Europe. The teenagers were able to keep their faith hidden, concealing the polished wooden crosses they wear around their necks underneath thick clothes. But other Eritrean Christians told MailOnline they were forced to deny their faith to stay alive. Aman, 18, said: 'I had a wooden cross but I had to throw it away to keep my life. The gunmen came around looking for Christians. They said they would kill the infidels, so I cut my cross off my neck and threw it away. 'I speak Arabic so I pretended that I was not a Christian, that I pray to their God, and they believed me.' Aman, together with Haben, Samuel and another Eritrean Tesfalem, who are all followers of the Coptic Orthodox Church - the main Christian Church in Egypt which has members worldwide - set off on the perilous sea journey across the Mediterranean last week. Refugee route: Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country . The 29-minute video released on Sunday is titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', and shows dozens of militants butchering two separate groups of men in the north African country . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video.  Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in boats launched from Libya. Aman, speaking from Mineo which is a temporary home to around 4,000 people, said: 'We paid $2000 each for a place in a boat. The boat left Libya and we were in the sea for two days before we were rescued. 'We were taken to the port and then to a camp with other refugees. 'But we won't stay here. We are going to Rome and then other countries. We want to work and make a hood life.' Haben said he fled his homeland after he was conscripted into the army - an ordeal that can last up to 30 years in this authoritarian state in the Horn of Africa. The country has been likened to African version of North Korea, led by President Isaias Afewerki. Most of the adults living in Eritrea face conscription or compulsory labour. The other migrants were sent by their families in the hope they could lead a better life - an education and good jobs - than is impossible in the isolated nation state. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centres after landing in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . As well as the spread of ISIS in the country, Libya is currently in a state of civil war - with two rival governments controlling and operating in different areas of the country. People smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught. In 2015 there have already been 30 times more migrants dying off the coast of Libya than in 2014 - which was itself a record-breaking year. Last week, Christian refugees  revealed how they linked arms to form a 'human chain' in a desperate bid to stop Muslim migrants throwing them into the sea after an argument about religion. A group of 15 men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate' earlier this month after 12 Christians from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown off a rubber dinghy into the Mediterranean Sea. Survivors from the boat, made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities, have now claimed the men tried to throw other Christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain. Born out of the Iraqi War in 2003, Islamic State's deadly grip has stretched across the Middle East and into northern-Africa where today, only the Mediterranean Sea separates the militants from Europe. It has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria. New ground: ISIS has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya (pictured) while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria . Europe's doorstep: Islamic State has now gained control of a number of Libyan coastal towns including Benghazi, Sirte, Derna and Nofilia . ISIS commands 31,500 loyal fighters according to the CIA but a commander of the Kurdish fighters who battled the extremists told the Independent on Sunday that they number closer to 200,000. Its growth in power and territory has been staggering since 2004 when it was known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). The group played a prominent role in the violent insurgency against the US and British occupation of Iraq after toppling Saddam Hussein's rule in 2003. After a string of bombings and murders over the next two years, its membership grew to around 1,000 according to the Washington Monthly. AQI then merged with its Mujahideen Shura Council allies in October 2006 to form the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). During the Iraq War which took place between 2006 and 2008, ISI had strongholds in Mosul, Baghdad, Al-Anbar and Diyala and commanded between 1,000 and 2,500 soldiers by late 2012. When it expanded into Syria in April 2013, it finally transformed into the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS) as it exists today. Islamic State has now self-proclaimed the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital, although there have been reports of increased defections. It was once a rebel group defying the British and US occupation of Iraq. Now other extremists across the Middle East and northern-Africa are pledging allegiance to it. Terrorist organisations inside Libya such as Ansar al-Sharia - which has taken control of Benghazi and declared its own Islamic state - also announced its alliance with ISIS in 2014."}

It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family. On Saturday - the day which English and drama teacher Ms Scott was set to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley - a memorial was held to honour the late bride-to-be. On Saturday, the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, a memorial was held . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service at the weekend . In a poignant move, the memorial service took place at the same time as when her wedding ceremony was due to take place. Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton. The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher. 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday. 'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her. 'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.' Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was too upset to take the stage, but was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life. A vigil has been created at the school where the popular 26-year-old teacher taught drama and English . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}

Rachel Lehnardt, 35, had been a life-long follower of the Mormon church and had never touched a drop of alcohol before her split from her husband James, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from Iraq, her lawyer said in a statement on Thursday. But following their divorce last year, she began drinking and ultimately broke away from the church, where she had once been a Sunday school teacher, the lawyer said. Her alcohol abuse culminated in the startling incident in which she allegedly allowed her daughter and her friends to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in front of her at their Evans, Georgia home. Scroll down for video . Struggles: Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, is pictured walking outside her Georgia home on Wednesday, several days after she was arrested for allegedly throwing a drunken party for her teenage daughter . She had already been drunk when her 16-year-old daughter returned with her friends, according to her lawyer, Shawn Hammond. According to authorities, Lehnardt and the teenagers then played naked Twister - although Lehnardt left halfway through the game to have sex with an 18-year-old man in the bathroom. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, Augusta Crime reported. After going to bed, she awoke around 3.30am to find her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend raping her and immediately threw him off, according to Hammond. The girl later told her mother that she felt guilty because his 10-inch penis was too big for her, so he had to have sex with her mom instead, according to a police report. According to Hammond, Lehnardt woke the next day and realized that her drinking had got out of hand and had led to her being raped by the 16-year-old. Her daughter has now split from the boy. Video from KJBF . Arrested: Lehnardt, pictured in her mug shot, was arrested after she told her AA sponsor about the incident and the sponsor then contacted authorities. Lehnardt said she is working to put it behind her . Split: Her lawyer said Lehnardt, who is a life-long Mormon, turned to drink after divorcing from her husband James Lehnardt, pictured right. He returned from Iraq with PTSD and was later discharged, the lawyer said . After the incident, the children's paternal grandparents found out about the party from the teenage girl and were awarded custody of the five children. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected. Lehnardt's lawyer said she was shocked with what had happened so she researched local Alcoholics Anonymous groups and met with a sponsor, named Heidi, who encouraged Lehnardt to tell her about her divorce, her drinking and the incident that led to her losing her children. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend, and admitted to being a porn addict. Heidi then went to authorities and told them what the mother-of-five had confessed to doing at the party. Lehnardt's lawyer called Heidi's decision to go to the sheriff's office 'unfortunate'. Lehnardt was arrested last Saturday and charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Hammond, the lawyer, released a statement shared by Augusta Crime on Thursday, saying Lehnardt was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened. 'Mrs. Lehnardt acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct,' he said. 'Although, many of the allegations are exaggerated, she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counseling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated.' He denied that she had thrown the party for the teenagers or provided them with drugs, and said she would be fully cooperating with authorities. 'Mrs. Lehnardt has recommitted herself to her faith and her family,' he continued. 'She is hopeful that her children, members of her faith and others will learn from her poor example as to just how easy it is for people to exercise such extremely poor judgment while intoxicated.' He did not comment on the naked Twister, bathroom sex or sex toy allegations, and simply said reports of the incident had been exaggerated. Denial: The mother-of-five said she did not throw the party but did admit to witnessing teenagers smoke marijuana. She also claimed she later awoke to her daughter's teenage boyfriend raping her . Scene: After the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, she lost custody of her five children . Downcast: Her lawyer said she has been a life-long Mormon who only recently started drinking alcohol . Before the divorce, she had never consumed alcohol, drugs or caffeine, he said. She married her husband, James, in 2000 and they had five children together, now aged between four and 16. James Lehnardt served with an artillery unit in Iraq during one of his deployments where he held the rank of specialist. He was based in Basra, Iraq's second largest city, from July 2009 as part of Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 17th Fires Brigade, Brigade Aviation Element. The unit, part of the 7th Division, co-ordinated American and Iraqi security force missions in the south of Iraq after British forces left and American troops were deployed there to deal with the Shi'ite militia which took control of the city. He was later based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Tacoma, Washington and more recently, the Augusta-Fort Gordon area of Georgia. But due to his PTSD and anger issues, he was ultimately discharged and is now on VA disability, according to Mrs Lehnardt's lawyer. According to her sponsor, who went to police, she also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . Neighborhood: She was already drunk when her daughter and her friends came back to the neighborhood, pictured, because they had been staying at their father's, she said . The couple separated in 2014 and she kept custody of the children. She also returned to work, where she struggled while earning just above minimum wage, he explained. Around this time, she started drinking at the weekends when she didn't have the children and it ultimately got out of hand, leading to the incident at their Evans home, her lawyer said. Following her arrest on Saturday, she posted $3,200 bond and was released from the Columbia County Detention Center. While Lehnardt said she had been raped by the teenage boy, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. This week, she was seen outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes, and looking downcast. Her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, remain with their grandparents."}

Audio has surfaced of the cop who killed Walter Scott laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the deadly shooting in South Carolina earlier this month. Michael Slager, 33, can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. The dashcam footage showing Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran, being pulled over for a broken tail light just minutes before Slager shot him, was released to the media on Thursday. The camera continued to record for another hour and a recording of the audio feed, including the conversation between Slager and a senior officer, was obtained by The Guardian. 'By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,' the senior officer said. 'You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.' 'It's pumping,' Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: 'Oh yeah. Oh yeah.' The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days. Scott was shot five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death has sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Warning: Graphic Content Below . Scroll down for audio and video . Slager can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5 . Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. The dashcam also recorded a cellphone call that Slager received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer. 'Hey. Hey, everything's OK, OK?' Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside . Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest . Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians . Scott, who was remembered as a beloved father, had his coffin draped in an American flag during Saturday's funeral ceremony ."}

And I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun’. ‘I have made a lot of money. Most of this is the incomparable TV Money. Nothing like it’. After the first year of the hit TV show, when she won the Golden Globe and Emmy for best actress, her salary headed skyward for over ten years and she kept that fact a secret. Financial secrets prevailed in her upbringing by her model/ actress mother and her famous father, Edgar Bergen, best known for as ventriloquist who's sidekick was dummy Charlie McCarthy. Scroll down for video . Puppet envy: In her new memoir, Candice Bergen writes that her father belittled her looks and favored his dummy. She reveals that she would sit on one of her father’s knees at the breakfast table and Charlie McCarthy sat on the other.‘A gentle squeeze on the back of my neck was my cue to open and shut my mouth so he could ventriloquize me. Charlie and I would chatter together silently, while behind us Dad would supply the snappy repartee for both of us' Success: Candice starred in the long-running TV hit Murphy Brown, here with costar Grant Shaud . Happy at last: Candice Bergen and husband Marshall Rose t the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party . Edgar spent more time with the dummy than his first-born child, Candice. And when he died in 1978, her penurious father left his only daughter out of his will - but not Charlie.. Charlie McCarthy was willed $10,000 with the proviso that the funds be managed, invested and reinvested to fund ventriloquist performances in the future. Edgar wrote ‘I make this provision for sentimental reasons which to me are vital due to the association with Charlie McCarthy who has been my constant companion and who has taken on the character of a real person and from whom I have never been separated even for a day’. ‘I’d chased my father’s approval all my life and here was proof I’d never get it’, the actress candidly reveals in her new memoir, A Fine Romance, published by Simon & Schuster. Charlie McCarthy dominated Candy’s childhood. She sat on one of her father’s knees at the breakfast table and Charlie sat on the other. ‘A gentle squeeze on the back of my neck was my cue to open and shut my mouth so he could ventriloquize me. Charlie and I would chatter together silently, while behind us Dad would supply the snappy repartee for both of us. Charlie had his own bedroom next to mine – and his was bigger. Candy's competition for her dad's affections was not with a sibling - it was with her ventriloquist EdBound to give Charlie McCarthy . ‘Those were unique circumstances to grow up in. Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being,' she writes . ‘Those were unique circumstances to grow up in. Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being’. ‘I knew my father loved me, but with his Swedish reserve, it wasn’t his nature to tell me’, Bergen writes. He was not physically affectionate and when the young girl decided to get over her own terror of trying to say she loved him, his response to her declaration was a pat on the hand. But the two would go up in his plane together and he’d prop the young girl up on phonebooks and let her fly the plane. They also went on fishing outings together and took long breakfast rides on horseback when visiting Palm Springs. ‘Still I was hurt, shocked when I discovered he had left me out of his will’. She didn’t need the money but it was an emotional slight. Edgar also kept secrets from his wife – the contents of a safe in his study. When Candice and her mother finally figured out the combination after his death, the name ‘Charlie’ transposed into numbers, the door opened to reveal fabulous pieces of jewelry that Edgar had purchased and stowed away as investments and also to avoid paying taxes on them. Mrs. Frances Bergen, known professionally as Frances Westcott after becoming ‘the Chesterfield Girl’ and the ‘Ipana (toothpaste) Girl’ in newspaper ads and on billboards, had no clue as to the existence of the large marquis diamond ring or the beautiful diamond necklace with an aquamarine the size of an egg. Edgar never included her in any financial discussion but after his death, she became the ‘stock witch’, cleverly quadrupling the value of the estate over twenty years. Charlie McCarthy always dominated Candice’s life. She compared playing her award-winning title role on Murphy Brown to channeling her inner Charlie. The Murphy Brown character fit her like a glove and ‘gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self’. Her father was schizophrenic in the same way -- buttoned-down, quiet, and introverted– unless he was with friends or had Charlie with him, an invitation to be risqué and tell dirty jokes. Director Louis Malle and actress Candice Bergen attend the 'Dangerous Liaisons'  premier in 1988 . ‘He belonged to a men’s group called the Rancheros Visitadores. They would go on weekend horseback rides and camp out and tell stories and fart around a campfire’. Then he would revert to his introverted self when back at home. Candice married the brilliant French film director, screenwriter and producer Louis Malle in 1980. When she became pregnant with their first and only child, Chloe Malle, Candice agonized over whether or not she would be able to tell the baby still in her womb that she loved her. She had never heard those words growing up and had never been able to tell her parents she loved them until late in their lives and well into her thirties. For thirty-nine years, those feelings were suppressed until Chloe was born in 1985 and then the infant hijacked Candice’s feelings and turned her into a lunatic if she was separated from the child. The little girl became the love of her life distancing her from Malle. He escaped Los Angeles to work in France and New York. But the couple remained devoted and thought about having a second child until Louis was diagnosed with myelofibrosis that morphed into lymphoma and inflammation of the brain. The illness was fatal.' ‘I was in a black anger. I felt that my life, which had always been blessed, had suddenly been hijacked by this completely other force.’ Candice's daughter Chloe is engaged and will marry in France, as her mother did Chloe's father, this summer . ‘I felt like my heart was breaking’. She hid in the housekeeper’s room and cried at night. She sought out primal scream therapy and was angry that that her life was being taken away from her and that she had become caretaker. Louis died in November 1995 at age sixty-three and Bergen confesses she still thinks about him all the time. ‘We loved each other completely, then were pulled apart by distance’. Three years later in 1998, she met Marshall Rose, who had been chairman of the New York Public Library, a real estate developer, philanthropist and a billionaire. They married in June 2000 and writes that she found this new married life claustrophobic. She and Louis had lived together and apart with his work in Europe. Now ‘Marsh’ was reaching out for a closeness she found excessive and suffocating and reacted to with tiny tantrums. Back to analysis that helped her open up to the continued tenderness of her second husband. Feeling too old for movies, feeling like a cliché, a middle-aged actress with no job offers, she was suffering from empty nest syndrome until the offer to act in Boston Legal in 2005 came along and rescued her from her anxieties. These days Bergen accepts the thirty pounds she’s packed on since her marriage to Marsh. She accepts that she is ‘a champion eater. ‘No carb is safe – no fat either’. Always a compulsive eater, when she was a young girl, she consumed twelve peanut butter and jelly sandwich halves in less than ten minutes. She no longer overeats past gratification but still indulges in cookies and ice cream if she can find where the housekeeper has hidden them and Parmesan cheese. She writes there is so much fat in her face that the skin is stretched to the max while hanging in folds under her chin. She’s on meds for mini-strokes she first suffered while taping Boston Legal, but she’s off the Prozac that had been prescribed. She’s given up chasing plastic surgery or fills to look younger and has settled in a loving and devoted relationship with Marsh. A Fine Romance by Candice Bergen and published by Simon & Schuster is available on Amazon tomorrow."}

In an intensely personal interview, he revealed: 'We weren't falling out with each other, but we were falling apart just coping with the nights and everything.' His comments were echoed by his wife who, in a separate interview, said the stresses of looking after Ivan pushed their relationship close to 'breaking point'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has revealed that he and his wife Samantha (pictured together in 2008 with their son Ivan) were 'falling apart' with the pressure of trying to care for their son  after he was born with a rare brain disorder . Ivan (pictured) was born with Ohtahara Syndrome, a rare brain disorder which left him in a wheelchair, needing to be fed through a tube and suffering from cerebral palsy and severe epileptic fits. He died aged six in 2009 . In a tearful interview, Mrs Cameron spoke for the first time of the 'nightmare' of learning that their first child had a rare disorder which left him needing round-the-clock care. Within a year, she said, looking after him had left the Camerons 'totally shattered' and trying to 'find a way through'. And she described the shock of his sudden death, which came 'out of the blue'. Ivan was born with Ohtahara Syndrome, a rare brain disorder which left him in a wheelchair, needing to be fed through a tube and suffering from cerebral palsy and severe epileptic fits. He died aged six in 2009. Speaking days ahead of what would have been his 13th birthday on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said: 'It's true – it is a knock. You are exhausted. You become a part-time parent, nurser, carer, doctor.' Mrs Cameron recalled how within days of Ivan's birth she knew 'something wasn't quite right' because he was making 'funny, jerky movements'. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday – which pictured her at home in Downing Street with her husband and their other children – she said: 'It's your worst nightmare. They did a whole load of tests, they push the box of tissues towards you and you feel like you're in an episode of Casualty.' Mr Cameron said Ivan was a 'blessing in lots of ways' but admitted the strains he created on their life left them both 'falling apart'. He said: 'We both worked out that we could cope, and find a way through this' Dressed, fittingly, in a fleece, David Cameron took a break from the campaign trail yesterday to be photographed feeding a newborn, orphaned lamb. He cradled the young animal to feed it milk from a bottle after dropping in at Dean Lane Farm in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire. At one point they were snuggled up so close that they were nuzzling each other’s faces. Inevitably, it prompted a flurry of comments on Twitter, several from Labour supporters, many of them unrepeatable and several referring to mint sauce. David Cameron took a break from the campaign trail yesterday to feed a newborn, orphaned lamb in Witney . The diagnosis had 'frightening' and 'scary' implications, she said, adding: 'It changes your life for ever. It's tough, lonely and isolating. You are terrified of not being able to cope.' She praised her 'amazing, strong and steady' husband and his 'sense that it's going to be OK'. Mr Cameron, in a separate interview with the Sunday Times, said Ivan was a 'blessing in lots of ways' but admitted the strains he created on their life left them both 'falling apart'. He said: 'It takes over your life. We both worked out that we could cope, and find a way through this.' In a frank admission of the pressures their son's condition had placed on their relationship, Mrs Cameron said: 'There's lots of people in our situation whose marriages don't survive. 'Looking after a disabled child pushes you to the limits of what you can cope with physically, emotionally. By the end of the first year we were totally shattered and pretty much at breaking point. Samantha Cameron . Samantha Cameron has said she would be ‘fine’ if her children copied her and got a tattoo. The Prime Minister’s wife has a leaping dolphin on her right foot which she had done during a gap year spent travelling in Indonesia following her A-levels. Asked how she would feel if her children followed her example, she told the Mail on Sunday: ‘I’d be fine about it. ‘Obviously you’d have to explain that they might not want it in certain places where it would be for ever. But no, I wouldn’t have any problem with them having a tattoo.’ 'The doctors realised we needed help. But as parents you have this feeling that you shouldn't ask for help.' She added that they were 'so, so proud' of Ivan, saying: 'He was very beautiful, one of the great gifts in our lives. A day when you haven't been to hospital, a day when he smiled, or a day when you haven't cried, becomes the most amazing day.' She described her battles with education bosses who tried to send Ivan to a mainstream school, before his parents secured him a place at a special needs school. 'Ivan had a feeding tube, very bad epilepsy. He couldn't sit up. He couldn't communicate at all. He needed to be somewhere more sensory and stimulating with people who knew how to look after him,' she said. His death came as a big shock. 'It was totally out of the blue and happened so quickly,' she said. 'It takes a long time before you see sunlight poking through the dark fog but never does the pain go as it's so connected to the love.' She said she still receives some bereavement counselling. Mr Cameron also spoke of Ivan's death: 'Your whole world collapses. You push pause on your life; you stop and have a think. Nothing really matters at that stage.' In her interview Mrs Cameron also revealed that her taste in music includes US psychedelic band Polica, whose latest album Shulamith has on its cover a topless woman with her back turned and her hair and neck covered in blood. Mrs Cameron saw the band perform in London when they toured Britain. The album is named after Canadian Marxist Shulamith Firestone, the author of The Dialectic Of Sex: The Case For A Feminist Revolution. Mrs Cameron also told of her embarrassment at being told Nancy and Elwen were having a 'huge pillow and duvet fight' when the family stayed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at her schloss near Berlin in 2013. This picture - from a new set of photographs showing the Camerons at home in Downing Street - has a clear message: That while the Prime Minister has been holding down the most important job in Britain for the past five years, he’s also made time to learn the all-important art of tying up his daughter’s hair for school. Showing that being left-handed is no handicap, he holds four-year-old Florence’s hair with one hand while brushing with the other. Behind them, the dishwasher looks suspiciously empty in the midst of the morning chaos inevitable in the home of any family of five, but reaching down to it provides the Prime Minister’s wife with an opportunity to show off her enviable figure . While this battered ministerial red box may have carried some of the most important documents in British history, as it lies around in the Cameron household it becomes the perfect toy. In this previously unseen 2011 family photograph of Florence as a toddler, she fits perfectly into the box as it sits perched on the yellow sofa from the Fancy Nancy range at sofaworks.com (£1,579).

Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, crossed over the Turkish-Syrian border last February and are believed to be living in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Begum has forged social media links with three of the British leaders of the al-Khansa brigade – an all-women militia set up by the terror group a year ago – and it is understood the trio are now training with one of the notorious females arms of ISIS. Covered in black from head-to-toe and wielding automatic weapons, the group has been accused of doling out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa and spying on its citizens. They are said to mercilessly patrol the streets of the terror group's adopted capital and has previously declared children as young as nine should be married, women should obey men – who are their masters – and remain 'hidden and veiled' at all times. Scroll down for video . Exodus: Amira Abase (left), 15, and Kadiza Sultana (right), 16, also travelled to Istanbul from UK on February 17 before reportedly entering Syria - where they could now be under the control of deadly female insurgents . Life of terror: 15-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) - one of three British teenagers who is now believed to be inside Syria - contacted Aqsa Mahmood who is considered to be one of the leaders of brutal all-woman militant group al-Khansa . Extreme beliefs: The al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Armed patrol: Chilling footage from inside ISIS' adopted capital Raqqa revealed how the notorious women of al-Khansa patrol the streets with automatic weapons - while tending to their toddlers . According to Syrian activist group Raqqa is being Slaughtered Silently, the female fanatics are feared by local women, particularly due to their use of torture. The activist group claim imprisoned women are tortured using a device known as 'the biter', a iron bar with sharp jagged edges. Placed on the helpless woman’s chest, the serrated edges of the bar are pressed into the woman's skin, causing deep lacerations. Such is the violence of the torture, some women reportedly slip into unconsciousness due to the pain. Aqsa Mahmoud, a 20-year-old woman from Glasgow who fled to Syria in 2013, is reportedly the leader of an al Khansaa group known as 'Om Amara'. Om Amara is reportedly a female foreign battalion, with just two Arabic speakers who mercilessly patrol the streets of Raqqa. Begum made contact with Mahmood, known as Umm Layth, on social media prior to departing for Turkey. Begum also used her Twitter account to follow two other members of the al-Khansa brigade known only by their Islamic names Umm Khattab and Umm Waqqas. In one of her recent tweets, Umm Waqqas advised British women on marriage in the Islamic State saying they should choose their jihadi fighters carefully and not to marry any 'Tom Dick or Harry'. The British women jihadists in Syria have conducted a sustained recruitment campaign in the last few months and are thought to operate a woman-only jihadi route for European girls who are groomed to leave their Western lives for the caliphate. They use social media, including Tumblr, Twitter and Ask.fm to publish detailed, practical advice about how to adapt to life in Islamic State and suggest essential items that the teenage wannabe-jihadists will find useful when they arrive. Privately-educated Glaswegian Mahmood - along with Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22 - are thought to be helping patrol Raqqa with guns and daggers hidden beneath their robes. Terror leader: Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), who was reported missing by her Scottish parents in 2013, is now a prominent member of a dangerous all-woman police force that dishes out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa, Syria . Shocking: In 2014, Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria as young children looked on . Trained to kill: One of the Halane twins, who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, tweeted this picture with the caption: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters' Wrong hands: The three teenagers who recently fled to Syria are feared to be with the al-Khansa Brigade, who have been accused of oppressively monitoring the behaviour of women in the city . The group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in the city and dishing out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. Mahmood recently advised that the Syrian winter was even colder than what she had experienced in her native Scotland and suggested 'winter woolies' were an essential. Seventeen-year-old British jihadi twins Salma and Zahra Halane from Manchester, who left for Syria in June last year, are thought to be with older British women who have taken on matriarchal roles within the group. They have been posting pictures on their Twitter accounts showing four al-Khansa women - veiled and armed with automatic weapons - undertaking 'self defence' training. Umm Khattab started a Twitter account on June 27 - the day after Zahra and Salma Halane went missing from their home in Manchester to head for Syria. Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to join the Al-Khansa Brigade in Syria in June last year - after becoming radicalised online . Shooting practice: One of the twins tweeted an image showing the women of Al-Khansa practising with their automatic weapons while dressed head-to-toe in black niqabs . Brain washed: The Halane twins have posted a number of pictures on their accounts where they are dressed completely in black and brandishing deadly weapons - just like their Al-Khansa sisters . Path of extremism: Yusra Hussein (pictured), 16, was also reported to have arrived in Syria in October and is also thought to have been mentored by British jihadists . She later tweeted: 'Missing twins – chilling with one of them now', adding she had met 'many British girls' since arriving in Syria. The female branch of ISIS also released an eye-opening manifesto stating Western women who join the terror group have a duty to wed a jihadi – then spend their life cooking, cleaning and raising a family. Two other British schoolgirls, Yusra Hussien, 16, from Bristol and Samya Dirie, 17, from south London, who were reported to have arrived in Syria last October, are also thought to have been mentored by the British jihadists. Brutal patrols: The duties of the all-woman jihadi group  include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise . Jihadi bride: Another Briton who left Britain to join ISIS is Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare (left, with her Swedish terrorist husband Abu Bakr) Muslim society: Members of the all-female Al-Khansa Brigade are seen walking in their adopted capital of Raqqa in Syria . Security services say that 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women. According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, a US-based monitoring group, al-Khansa was set up by ISIS commanders in Raqqa, northern Syria, in February last year. Its members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about £100. Their duties include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise. Uniform: Al-Khansa's members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about £100 . Deadly: British members of the female militant group are the most extreme members of the group and are responsible making barbaric threats against Britain . Mahmood, who once studied radiography at Glasgow Caledonian University, is regarded as one of the leaders of the group of British female jihadists. She was reported missing by her parents over a year ago before surfacing in Syria last February as an outspoken supporter of the terrorist group. In her tweets, she urged Muslim men and women who could not come to fight to instead commit terrorist atrocities at home, praising the brutal murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, the bombing of the Boston Marathon and the shooting of soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas. 'If you cannot make it to the battlefield, then bring the battlefield to yourself,' she tweeted."}

Sisters Yogita Rameshbhai Nandwana, five, and Anisha, three, and their 18-month-old brother Harsh, are among the world's heaviest young children. Weighing 5st 5lbs (34kg), 7st 8lbs (48kg) and 2st 5lbs (15kg) respectively, the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month. Now their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 34, of Gurjarat, India, is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists. He said: ‘If my kids continue to grow at this rapid rate they will have major health issues. We’re terrified they will die.’ Scroll down for video . Obese: (From left) Yogita, five, Harsh, 18 months, and Anisha, three, weigh 5st 5lbs (34kg), 2st 5lbs (15kg) and 7st 8lbs (48kg) respectively . Yogita and Anisha eat 18 chapatis, 3lbs of rice, two bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits, 12 bananas and a litre of milk daily. And their extreme hunger means their mother Pragna Ben, 30, spends most of her day making their meals. She said: ‘My day starts with making 30 chapatis and 1kg vegetable curry in the morning. After that I am again in the kitchen preparing more food. ‘Their hunger never stops. They demand food all the time and cry and scream if they’re not fed. I am always in the kitchen cooking for them.’ The couple have one older daughter, Bhavika, six, who weighs an average 2st 7lbs (16kg), and do not know why their other three children are so big. Mr Nandwana said: ‘When Yogita was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg (3.3lbs). We were worried for her health. 'So we fed her a lot during the first year of her life to build her strength but by her first birthday she had bloated to 12kg (1st 12lbs). Family: Rameshbhai Nandwana (left), 34, and Pragna Ben (back right), 30, are the parents of Yogita (front left), Anisha (front right), Harsh (front centre) and six-year-old Bhavika (rear centre), their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs. They all live together in Gujarat, India . ‘Our third daughter Anisha also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg. ‘But we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son Harsh was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year. 'We started looking for medical help and consulted many doctors but they would just refer us to bigger hospitals that I couldn’t afford.’ Mr Nandwana earns just Rs 3000 (£35) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children. He said: ‘I am a daily wage labour and I usually get paid Rs 100 a day but there are times when there is no work at all. ‘I work in fields, dig wells, and do whatever menial job I can find to earn money. 'And I’m constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children.’ Despite his paltry income, Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children and said he 'cannot leave them starving' Diet: Yogita and Anisha eat eight chapatis, 4lbs of rice, three bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily .

Six wheat chapatis . One litre of milk . Buttermilk (1.5 litres) Two big bowls of vegetables . He added: ‘If I don’t have the money, I borrow it from my brothers and friends. But I make sure I feed my children when they need.’ The father has spent Rs 50,000 (£540) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years – without any improvement in his children’s condition. He said: ‘No one in our family has a giant frame. Only my children are overweight. As parents, it pains us immensely to see them unable to move. ‘They cannot walk; they cannot do anything on their own. Selling my kidney is a desperate measure. But I’m now desperate to get the right help for my children.’ Miss Ben cannot pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around. She said: ‘They need me to help them bath or when they need the toilet. I’m only 40 kg so it’s impossible for me to pick them up. ‘It’s a struggle when my husband is at work. Hard-working: Anisha hugs her father Rameshbhai, with Harsh. Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children . 'They are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that, they cannot go to school. 'All they do all day is eat and play and giggle with each other. 'I want my daughters to get an education and play like other kids. I want them to have a life. This is no life.’ Local doctors believe the children are suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, but do not know how to treat it. The rare genetic condition causes various symptoms including constant hunger, reduced muscle tone, restricted growth and learning difficulties. Dr Akshay Mandavia, a paediatrician at Mandavia Children's Hospital in Gujarat, said: ‘There is an abnormal accumulation of fat in these children. ‘They’re not able to breathe properly, and they wheeze. Their condition could be due to endocrinal disease or Prader-Willi syndrome. ‘But we can only ascertain the right treatment after a proper diagnosis at one of our top hospitals.’ Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. These include: . It is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome number 15, which happens purely by chance, and is usually diagnosed by carrying out genetic tests. Sadly, there is no cure for the condition. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems such as overeating. Parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food . Instead, a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has, such as overeating. Children usually want to eat frequently, so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories, and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted. Getting the child to stick to an eating plan voluntarily is practically impossible, so parents usually need to lock any storage areas that contain foods, such as fridge or cupboards. They should also search the child’s room for hidden foods, forbid them to leave the house unsupervised, or play with other children who are eating food, in case they try to steal it. Any family, friends or teachers should be informed of the need to restrict their diet. The child should also be encouraged to exercise as much as possible. If the child has restricted growth, treatment with an artificial version of the human growth hormone (HGH) is usually recommended, as it can increase their final adult height by around 10.5cm (4.1 inches). Most adults with Prader-Willi syndrome are unable to live fully independent lives, such as having a full-time job and living in their own home. Their behavioural issues and problems with food mean these environments and situations are too demanding. Adults with the syndrome who don't live with their parents will probably require residential care. Source: NHS Choices .

Just a day after William's parents made an impassioned plea for the three-year-old to be returned to them, police have described the 'fast-paced' investigation into the new line of inquiry. 'The two worlds collided. We have information that could link William’s disappearance to a group of people suspected of paedophile activity,' said lead investigator Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin. Scroll down for video . The parents of missing William Tyrrell, who police now say may have been kidnapped by a paedophile ring, have revealed the moment they realised their son was missing . The focus of the investigation has shifted dramatically, and is now 'progressing rapidly', according to Homicide Squad commander Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, reported news.com.au. 'We are pursuing many, many lines of inquiry but what I can say is that there is a team of detectives working very hard. This is a very fast-paced moving inquiry,' Detective Superintendent Willing said. The Detective Sup took a firm stance on the consequences for anyone found to be involved with the toddler's disappearance. 'If you know anything you are implicated. If you are involved you will be charged,' he said. Det Sup Willing also spoke of the heartache William's parents had experienced since his abduction, and said that the family needed answers to where their beloved little boy was. This comes as the three-year-old's mother spoke out about the horrifying moment she realised her son had vanished. Little William's mother frantically searched the house, opening cupboards and yelling out, 'You need to talk to mummy and tell me where you are' in the moments after she found she couldn't hear her son. 'When I realised that William was missing – I think back to that moment where I just went, \"I can't hear him, why, why can't I hear him\",' she said. William had been in the front yard of his grandmother's house in Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast, when he disappeared in September last year. 'I just walked out and just I see nothing, I hear nothing, I'm speechless. I'm walking around in a circle on the spot thinking where is he? Why can't I see him? And I'm yelling out, \"William, where are you\"?' his mother told The Sydney Morning Herald. The toddlers parents released a heart-wrenching video earlier on Friday begging for his return. 'Just give him back ... take him to a church, take him to a police station, take him to school. Give him to someone, give him back,' his mother says in a video released by police. William's father choked back tears as he remembered his son, who was infatuated with the Spider-Man superhero. '(He loved) anything that related to Spider-Man and superheroes,' William's father said in the video. 'He's a cheeky, vibrant little boy ... full of energy. I mean he's my little boy.' One of the new photos released by police of William Tyrrell show the three-year-old smiling and playing guitar, while other images and photos show an energetic and happy youngster full of life . Heartfelt plea: William Tyrrell's distraught parents released a video pleading for their missing son's return as well as home movies showing the lively boy riding his bike (pictured) and playing at the family home . But he said William was a cautious boy who wouldn't go with a stranger. His mother said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... has gone `clump' on his shoulders, picked him up and moved him on ... because ... that's the only way ... to explain for him not to be there.' She said the family was struggling with not knowing where William is or what happened to him. 'We need to know what happened to him ... `cause we can't live forever ... like this.' She said she hoped whoever had him was looking after him. 'I want him to be safe, I want him to be feeling loved and I want someone to be looking after him because to imagine that something else is going on ... we can't live like that.' The distraught couple has also released new pictures and home videos of the boy in the hope that new clues will emerge as to his whereabouts. In the videos, William can be seen riding his bike down a path and flashing a cheeky grin, as well as playing a guitar and swivelling his hips in times to the music. 'Just give him back':  The parents (pictured) issued the plea in an emotional video released by NSW Police to encourage people to come with forward with new leads as to the missing toddler's whereabouts . Full of life: The new videos of William Tyrrell (pictured, above at a slightly younger age) show a smiling boy full of energy and his mother has begged kidnappers to show her son care and love if the little boy is still alive, seven months after police believe he was abducted from his grandmother's NSW mid north coast home . The parents of missing three-year-old William Tyrrell have released new pictures of their son and a video pleading for his return by abductors who are believed to have snatched him in daylight last September . Legal restrictions have prevented William's parents from speaking publicly throughout the ordeal, and their identities are not revealed in the video. The footage comes as detectives reveal that they believe the three-year-old may have been abducted by a paedophile ring. Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, NSW Homicide Squad Commander, said on Friday: 'One of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring.' He said detectives from the homicide squad and the sex crime squad are 'vigorously perusing that line of inquiry and this investigation is moving at a very fast pace.' 'We are persuing every lead that we get,' Detective Willing said. William was last seen dressed in a Spider-Man suit and playing in his grandmother's yard in broad daylight in a quiet street in Kendall last September. Vigorous pursuit: NSW Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing (pictured) revealed on Friday that police are investigating William Tyrrell's disappearance at a very fast pace and that 'one of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring' A new home video of cheeky William Tyrrell (pictured, eating cake) has been provided by the family in their desperate wait for the return of the three-year-old, seven months after his probable kidnap . Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. The parents are calling for any who has any information to contact Crime Stoppers immediately on 1800 333 000. The release of the video comes more than a month since police scoured bushland in Bonny Hills, south of Port Macquarie, for evidence relating to William's whereabouts. Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search a murky dam in a bush reserve and a nearby swamp, after more than 30 officers and the dog squad had spent spent two days searching through dense bushland - including along a track that can only be accessed by four-wheel drive. The three-day search was carried out near local washing machine repairman William 'Bill' Spedding's home. Mr Spedding was identified as a person of interest in the case after he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the toddler vanished. However, Mr Spedding says he didn't go to the house on September 12 because he couldn't get in contact with William's grandmother. Police searched the 63-year-old's home and business in nearby Laurieton in January, seizing various items, including cars, a mattress and computer, for forensic examination. Mr Spedding has strongly denied any involvement and police have previously stressed he isn't their only line of inquiry.

Around 650 foreign entrants, three times more than last year, joined in today's event under the constant watch of soldiers. The event - which only opened its doors to non-local amateurs in 2014 - was founded in 1981 in the single-party country, which is now led by brutal dictator Kim Jong un. One of this year's entrants Duncan Erasmus (far left) a 23 year-old software firm owner from Auckland ran in the full amateur marathon . Charles Kobold, a cable TV installation guy from the state of Wyoming, took gold in the 10km race. There were also categories for amateur full and half marathon runners plus North Korean entrants. Foreign professionals were not allowed to take part. Last year Will Marks, the British man who won the amateur half marathon category, revealed how runners were banned from displaying country flags and western logos. Photography was also forbidden, but many runners flouted the rule. Photographs of this year's event were submitted by people from Koryo Tours who flouted the ban to secretly snap the runners on their smartphones.

The event starts and finishes at the Rungnado May Day Stadium or Kim Il Sung Stadium (pictured) every year . Local entrants to the Pyongyang marathon were joined this year by hundreds of runners from across the world . Runners praised the jovial atmosphere as thousands of supporters turned out to cheer them on . ‘I did feel like I was in a bit of a bubble,’ he said. ‘The North Koreans were very friendly during the run but outside of it there was a marked change. They were very cautious about interacting with us, whereas it felt like during the marathon they were allowed [to interact more freely]. ‘Our cameras were confiscated by our tour guides – although they asked us for them very politely. ‘Although, like last year, some people managed to get through with cameras anyway.’ He added that alongside the thousands of supporters who came out to cheer them on was a huge number of soldiers strategically positioned to ensure that no-one stepped out of line or saw anything they weren't supposed to. ‘The soldiers were stern and restrained in their actions but even they cracked the occasional smile,’ said Mr Erasmus. ‘Their presence was everywhere – you could always see the uniform. ‘When I was running I noticed that they were positioned in places that could be deemed sensitive. For example, I saw three soldiers standing by an entrance to a construction site. They don’t like you photographing or even seeing construction.’ This year saw around 650 foreign entrants, three times more than last year, join in the Pyongyang marathon . Entrants were ran past North Korean monuments on during the marathon, such as the Arch of Triumph . Photographs of this year's event were submitted by people from Koryo Tours who flouted the ban to secretly snap the runners on their smartphones . Around 5,000 westerners visit North Korea every year. All tourists face tight restrictions and must be accompanied by guides who work for state-owned companies. Free roaming is banned. In February authorities announced that the marathon would be closed to foreigners due to North Korea’s borders being closed to keep out Ebola, despite no cases of the disease being reported in the country. They reversed their decision shortly afterwards. Mr Kobold, a 30 year-old cable TV installation worker from the city of Casper, won the 10km amateur race in the isolated country with a time of 40 minutes and 20 seconds. Speaking to MailOnline after the winners’ ceremony that took place in front of thousands of North Koreans in Pyongyang’s Kim il Sung Stadium, he described how he came second in last year’s 10km run. Back then he fainted due to exhaustion before picking up his medal, but he had no such problems this time round. 2014 Winner: British runner Will Marks  triumphed in the North Korean half marathon after the event was opened to foreigners for the first time last year . Photography was also forbidden at the marathon and other races but many runners flouted the rule . One of this year's entrants told MailOnline he was aware of being constantly watched but said the atmosphere remained jovial . ‘I only did the 10km run but I felt like a million dollars – I had 50,000 locals cheering me on in the stadium,’ he said. He added, ‘A lovely Korean woman in traditional dress gave me a porcelain vase, which was instead of the medals they gave out last year. It’s pretty big, it’ll have to be my carry-on luggage when I go back to the US.’ The race, named the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon after the late North Korea leader Kim il Sung’s birthplace, gave foreigners the rare chance to run through the streets of Pyongyang, which is home to the country’s elite classes. Thousands of locals came out in force to cheer them on. ‘There was a festival atmosphere – there were so many people waving and shouting “Hurry up!” in Korean to me,’ said Mr Kobold. He added, ‘I was high-fiving so many people. By the end my arms were in such pain from doing it, I couldn’t even wave to any more supporters.’ The marathon trip, like all other heavily-vetted tourist trips to North Korea, gave foreigners a sanitised view of the country .

The marathon trip, like all other heavily-vetted tourist trips to North Korea, gave foreigners a sanitised view of the country. Founded in 1981 in the single-party country, which is now led by brutal dictator Kim Jong un . It offered no glimpse of the horrors that allegedly exist outside the version of North Korea authorities allow outsiders to see. Human rights groups claim that torture, infanticide and oppression characterise Kim’s dictatorship and are kept from view. But Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, the tour firm that Mr Kobold travelled with, told MailOnline that events such as the marathon were good for increasing interaction with the culturally-isolated country. ‘It’s a good thing because anything that has foreigners interacting, even in the simplest way such as high-fiving, is positive,’ he said. He added, ‘At this marathon any interactions were fleeting. But it was a spectacle and an opportunity for the locals to see hundreds of foreigners and for foreigners to see thousands of North Koreans.’ During his 10km race Mr Kobold ran past landmarks such as the imposing Arch of Triumph and statues of late North Korean leaders Kim il Sung and Kim Jong il. He is staying in the Yanggakdo International Hotel before returning home. Despite Kim’s hatred of the US, and the fact that anti-US rallies regularly take place in Pyongyang, Mr Kobold found that western comforts were available in the hotel. ‘You can easily buy Coca Cola there,’ he said. ‘And I was pleasantly surprised to find Milka chocolate, which is originally from Germany, available.’ However, he said he was more likely to indulge in a few glasses of the local beer, Taedonggang, to celebrate his victory. ‘I’ve been enjoying it – it’s a little spicy but it’d stand up to a pint of Worthington’s,’ he said. Runners, in matching red tracksuits, lined up for the race which was closed to foreigners due to North Korea’s borders being closed to keep out Ebola, despite no cases of the disease being reported in the country.

There they were: phalanx upon phalanx of shiny new vehicles glinting like Dinky toys in the sun; and I suddenly realised that they weren’t arriving in this country. These cars hadn’t just disembarked from France or Germany or Japan. They were about to make their own journey overseas – they were British cars, for goodness sake. They were examples of British manufacturing and design and engineering – and they were about to be loaded on to ships and taken to other European countries, and to Africa, and Asia; and I reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country. Scroll down for video . Britain last year produced more than 1.5 million cars – the most since 2007 – and we are poised to overtake France and become the second biggest car manufacturing power in Europe. Across the West Midlands – and indeed across the country – there are now literally thousands of businesses, large and small, that are engaged in automotive innovation and supply; and there was a time when no one would have believed that was possible. I remember the 1970s. You, too, may remember that mullet- haired decade. The music was superb, the food was mediocre, and British industry was on its knees. I remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of ‘conveners’ and ‘shop stewards’, and when the man who ran British Leyland – then our biggest car company – appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called Red Robbo. When I was a child I am afraid to say that British cars were the butt of international derision. They leaked oil, and they were generally assembled with such slovenly imprecision they gained a reputation for unreliability that it has taken decades to shake off. Lemon after lemon rolled off our production lines, culminating in the ludicrous rustbucket called the Austin Allegro – and there was a reason for the disaster. Boris Johnson: The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s . We had atrocious relations between management and unions, and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions. We had a Labour government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market, or the desires of their customers – but to satisfy the rights of their workers. We had an era of tea breaks and ‘demarcation disputes’ and closed shops and one-out-all-out strikes, with the Labour government trying to impose such insane solutions as Tony Benn’s communist-style motorbike ‘collective’ at Meriden. It did not work then, and it seems to me to be deranged that we could be even contemplating going back to such arrangements now. I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone, who has long been on the Bennite wing. By Ed Miliband’s own admission, Livingstone has been a big influence in his thinking – and in their return to the Benn/Livingstone approach Labour’s plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise. Miliband is turning the Labour Party sharply back to the Left, and actively repudiating the chief insight of Tony Blair – that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy. That is why British business people are so unanimous in their horror, including many former Labour supporters and donors. They are not wrong. Labour wants to hit small- and medium- sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance – but it is worse than that. 'I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone' They want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s, in which management was deprived of the ability to manage. They want to make it easier for employees to take firms to employment tribunals – when you might think the system was already out of control, with people endlessly and automatically and indeed very often vexatiously claiming racial or sexual or age or disability discrimination. They want all companies with more than 50 employees to have a system of profit-sharing – a return to Bennery – and they want the workers to be able to block takeovers. That is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the City, higher income tax, and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with – the result of Labour’s failure to tackle the deficit. What makes this anti-capitalist agenda so dangerous is that the British motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms. We are talking about huge numbers of often tiny companies – firms that pride themselves on making a more efficient windscreen-wiper or a quieter air-conditioning unit or a more easily wipeable dashboard fascia. It is incredible but true that Britain now has more specialised motor manufacturing marques than any country on earth – Lotus, McLaren, Bristol, Morgan, Caterham, TVR… the list goes on. Think of London’s new hop-on hop-off Routemaster bus, a glorious piece of low-carbon technology and one of the greenest new buses on the market – made in Northern Ireland by Wrightbus. The West Midlands is once again the epicentre of one of the world’s densest ecosystems of motor manufacturing and development. British brands have shed their 1970s reputations; they are taking on the world and winning. How mad, how tragic, that this extraordinary British triumph should be faced with a Labour government that regards capitalism as ‘predatory’. The problem with Ed Miliband is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie – in fact I totally sympathise on that one. The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s, writes Boris Johnson . The problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time, though he did. He and Balls were at the controls in Downing Street when this country experienced the worst economic catastrophe in living memory – a catastrophe that was gravely exacerbated by their irresponsible fiscal policies. The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s. He genuinely thinks France is the model we should emulate, when the French – whatever the splendours of their civilisation – have 12 per cent unemployment, and when huge numbers of the most talented French people have decided that they wish France was more like Britain. How many Brits work in Paris? 16,000. How many French men and women live and work in London? About 400,000. Mais oui. That should tell Miliband all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies. Labour wants to go back to the 1970s, Ukip to some non-existent version of a monochrome 1950s, the Greens would like to go back to the middle of the stone age, and the Lib Dems would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls. There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that seems to believe in the genius of this country, and that has a plan to take it forward. The Lib Dems under Nick Clegg would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls . It is only the Conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those British cars lined up at Bristol. They aren’t the results of an evil and predatory system, by which workers are exploited and the boss class luxuriate in ever greater privilege. They are the fruits of a long and painful post-war period in which Britain has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete, and that we cannot hope to compete if we over-tax and over-regulate in the way that Ed Miliband is proposing. Those British-made vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the Labour-made disaster of 2008-9, in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars; an economy that has seen the creation, since 2010, of about two million jobs. And those glistening British cars at the Bristol docks therefore embody the great moral purpose of wealth creation – because it is only if you have a strong and vibrant economy that you can hope to raise the tax to pay for roads and schools and hospitals and pensions and welfare – not to speak of strong defences – and all the other civilised objectives that we want to meet. I really don’t think Miliband gets that. He is one of those theoretical socialists who thinks the problem with socialism is it has never been properly tried; and I am horrified at the idea he should be given another go. There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that believes that on the whole today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow is going to be better than today. That is David Cameron and the Conservatives. We need five more years to entrench this economic recovery, five years to take this country forwards and not backwards. That is the Battle for Britain next month, and one this country can’t afford to lose."}

But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity . Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls’ refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women’s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated £10,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: ‘I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women’s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. ‘I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra’s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved. Roberts had been working for Andrew's former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire (pictured together above) ‘I am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the United Kingdom. ‘Most importantly, this has helped the Women’s Interlink Foundation support more young people to develop skills, which is an important area of focus for my work.’ One of the young women who moved him so deeply was Anita, now 19. She was chosen to show the Duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge. In return, he left two copies of Little Red’s Summer Adventure, a book written by his former wife Sarah. The child of two tea garden labourers from northern Bengal, Anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends. Lured to New Delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family, she escaped only to find herself living as a ‘railway child’ at the city’s station. Illiterate and destitute, she had no way home until she was taken in by the WIF where she met the Duke on his trip. She was among the first girls to sign up to Key to Freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees – approximately £430 – supplying silk goods to Topshop. She has also been reunited with her family near Darjeeling. ‘We traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted,’ revealed Aloka. ‘Once we had told them her real story and that she’d learned English and Bengali and maths, and that she had a craft and was earning a living, they changed their mind.’ Anita said: ‘I am doing well now and so is my mother. She was sick and I have been able to pay for medical treatment for her. ‘I have earned almost 40,000 rupees through Key to Freedom and I have a skill which will help my future. I hope I keep getting orders for my work. I hope it won’t stop.’ Prince Andrew’s 25-year-old daughter, Princess Eugenie, and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have both paid private visits to help support the charity, and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative. The Duke’s eldest daughter Beatrice, 26, was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months, although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in New York. Eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house. Other workers with Key to Freedom include Taralika, 25, who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home. ‘She was locked up in a brothel and beaten, and then starved for days for refusing to have sex,’ said Aloka. Profits: About £20,000 from Topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their UK stores . ‘Finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police. She was, and still remains, mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she’s making excellent progress. She is happy and confident working as a tailor.’ Another Key to Freedom success story is Shila, 21, an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of Calcutta. Aloka said: ‘She now has a bank account like any other working woman. It has totally changed her life. ‘Poverty makes these women victims. They suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn. They live with abuse – mental, physical and sexual – just to be certain of food and shelter. ‘The Duke understood that and wanted to make a difference – as the father of two daughters I think the plight of the girls here resonated with him. ‘He wanted to given them their independence. Handmade: A silk Topshop kimono . ‘There was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit. The only thing he asked me was, “What do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls?” ‘I spoke to him about alternative income earning, a regular outlet to sell their work, and skills development to make their craft more marketable. His aides called less than an hour after he’d left and set up a meeting the same night. ‘He had already spoken to the Duchess of York about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could. The name Key to Freedom was her idea.’ Aloka added: ‘While I understood that their heart was in the right place, I also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought. ‘Not only did they find the time, they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today. ‘It was Prince Andrew’s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to Topshop. It’s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the UK.’ Aloka came to London for talks with the Duke’s team at Buckingham Palace just three months after their initial meeting, and by summer 2013 Key to Freedom was up and running. It fulfilled its first order to Topshop, every piece individually signed by the woman who made it, in July 2013. Since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold. Yesterday, the High Street giant, which sent designer Penny McIvor to India to assist with colours, patterns and quality control, confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year. Topshop declined to discuss sales figures, but it is understood around £20,000 has so far been paid by the company, which makes no profit from the scheme, to the Prince Andrew Charitable Foundation. This then sends the money back to Key to Freedom in Calcutta. In addition, the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace events for entrepreneurs last month, where 200 of its scarves were also on sale. The scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors, venture capitalists and mentors. A Buckingham Palace source said that the Prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity – such as Pitch@Palace – to promote it. ‘It’s been completely empowering for the girls here,’ said Aloka. ‘It’s about honour and dignity, and having control over their own future. ‘It means they can look ahead and put their past behind them.’"}

Billy Mitchell, now seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull, face, hands and feet. He endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities – which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and another to rebuild his features. He also had a titanium frame drilled into his head, which was left there for nine weeks. Billy Mitchell, seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes malformations . The surgeries carried risks including meningitis, brain damage, catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death, but Billy pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face. Billy’s mother, Denise Mitchell, 47, said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born. ‘When I saw him I had an overwhelming sense of love. But he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen,’ she said. ‘I also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together.’ It was then a doctor broke the news he suspected Billy had Apert syndrome, a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally. The condition is caused by a chromosomal defect. Children with Apert have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides. They may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a cleft palate, and may have webbed fingers and toes. After his birth, doctors feared Billy would not last the night. The next day Mr and Mrs Mitchell, who live in Hertfordshire, were forced to have a heartbreaking conversation with doctors about turning off his life support machine. Specialists feared Billy's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone, blocking his airway. Billy, pictured with his twin sister Lois, has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt . But miraculously, Billy held  on, and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children’s hospital where he had thin, metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe. He remained in a critical condition, surrounded by tubes and machines. Finally, when he was a month old, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister Lois and older sister Darcy, then five. But he often stopped breathing in the night, and at 10 weeks old Mrs Mitchell heard him crying. Apert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in 160,000 to 200,000 births. The condition is characterised by malformations of the skull, mid-face, hands and feet. The skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally. The mid-face - the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw - appears sunken. Some children with the condition have fused fingers and toes. Early surgery can relieve the pressure that builds up inside the fused skull as the brain grows. And operations can be carried out to re-model a child's face. She noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball, causing his eye to pop out. After rushing to a doctor, he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week. Children with Apert syndrome have very small eye orbits, meaning more of their eyeball is exposed. Billy's eye orbits were so shallow, especially the left, that his eye regularly popped out of its socket. Doctors advised Billy have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer. Just six weeks later, he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head. Known as a ‘front orbital advancement’, surgeons opened his skull, detached it, remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw. They also inserted two pins – each three inches long – into his head. For six months, the pins were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain. Billy now needs 24-hour care, which has put a strain on family life. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘Luckily Paul and I had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt. ‘But Darcy was still young and had to grow up fast. When Billy was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head . His fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly. When he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate Billy's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle . ‘And as for Lois, every time Billy was admitted to hospital, she’d look around wondering where he was. ‘But she was thriving, passing all the usual milestones. ‘It was also clear she had a special bond with Billy. Sometimes they’d snuggle up together. ‘When she learnt to sit up we propped Billy up with cushions and they’d spend ages playing together. And when Lois became mobile she’d fetch Billy his favourite toys.’ Billy’s fingers were fused together – known as ‘mitten hands’ – and so he struggled to clasp things properly. But when he was 17 months old a surgeon at Leeds General Hospital agreed to operate on them. During a nine hour operation, involving bone and skin grafts, he separated Billy’s fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes. In a second operation he finished the process, separating them fully. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘Billy had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing. ‘He grew in confidence overnight and a couple of weeks later learnt to sit up by himself. ‘Bright as a button he’d would watch Lois intently and began to copy her. As a family we were astounded by his progress. So too were the doctors.’ But the outside world was less understanding, and Mrs Mitchell said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram. ‘Walking down the street one day I heard one woman say to her friend: \"God he looks awful\". Earlier this year Billy had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks . ‘I was so upset I went straight home. ‘Another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see Santa when Darcy noticed some children pointing at Billy. ‘She told them not to do it because it was rude. Afterwards I overheard their mother saying: \"Well she shouldn’t bring him out should she.\" ‘If only they knew what Billy was going through.’ But determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool, Mr and Mrs Mitchell sent Billy to nursery and he went to exactly the same school as his twin sister Lois. Despite his difficulties he has turned into a typical little boy, obsessed with cars, reading books, and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister. Since his most recent surgery, Billy loves his new face, his mother Denise said . ‘He loved life and was determined to join in with everything,’ Mrs Mitchell says. In the summer of 2012 he underwent more major surgery. During a nine-hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth. His condition also left him with a distorted face and his eyes were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye sockets and breathing was a struggle. So earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery, where his face was literally taken apart, reshaped and put back together again to create more room. His head was cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically, with the skin being pulled down, exposing all of the bones of his face and jaw. His forehead, eye orbits, nose and top jaw were taken apart, reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts. The frame was left in place for nine weeks to encourage the bone to grow, as well as pull the existing facial bones forward. The bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame, a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘So far he’s endured more than 50 general aesthetics and has been through so much. ‘But since his recent surgery he loves his news face. When he saw it for the first time without the frame I think he would have done cartwheels if he could. ‘It was a massive boost to his confidence. ‘And now, a few months on, he doesn’t even associate himself as having Apert syndrome. ‘But what’s incredible is the way he’s taken everything in his stride. We can’t thank all the doctors and nurses enough who’ve looked after him. '"}

The former Secretary of State, played by Kate McKinnon, and one of her advisers, played by Vanessa Bayer, discuss how she will declare her intentions at noon on Sunday following years of speculation. The pair decide to record a cellphone video of the Democrat for her campaign launch in a bid to make her come across as soft and approachable, following concerns she will not be able to relate to ordinary voters. During the scene, which includes a cameo from her husband Bill, they insist her second run at the White House will be about the people and not centered around her. But, despite desperate attempts to not be self-centered, Clinton seems incapable of talking about anyone but herself and brushes off her potential competitors. The show took aim at the 67-year-old as she is expected to reveal via video that she is taking another stab at what she believes is 'the highest and hardest glass ceiling'. Saturday Night Live skewered the news that Hillary Clinton would be announcing her presidential campaign on social media this week . The show portrayed the former Secretary of State as aggressive and driven, saying things like; 'Citizens, you will elect me' Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Former US President Bill Clinton at a 2013 event. It is believed she will have a string of celebrity backers for her second White House bid . Barack Obama has already given her his backing by saying he believes she will be an 'excellent president', but the comedians on the NBC show latched onto a memo that was made public on Saturday, saying her campaign will be humble and about 'everyday Americans'. After decades in the public eye, and stints in political offices, she faces a challenge showing her more down-to-earth side. On her first try at recording the video she screams in a dictatorial manner: 'Citizens, you will elect me. I will be your leader.' For the second attempt, they try to get Clinton to stop saying 'I' or her name, but she also fails immediately. 'Hello, 'tis I, Hillary Clinton,' she says. The two women are then joined by Bill Clinton (Darrel Hammond), who sneaks up behind his wife as she is filming. He says how grateful he is that camera phones did not exist when he was president - because he would probably be in jail if they were. The former president tells America in his wife's video: 'Hillary would make a great president. And I would make an even greater first dude.' From there they decide to make talk about how difficult the election will be, and the tough challenges Clinton will face from other Democrats. She starts talking about potential rival Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, but the starts laughing, saying: 'He sounds like a Simpsons character.' Her husband makes a second appearance at this point with his saxophone, playing the theme tune to The Simpsons and revealing that he will be his wife's Vice President. He adds that when she dies it will be 'Bill Clinton 2: Bigger and blacker.' After trying to quiet her husband, Clinton gives in and says; 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back.' She then goes over one more problem she has with her adviser - the fact she cannot be her own vice president. Bill Clinton was also featured in the skit, urging America to elect Hillary so he could be her vice president. He adds that he will make a great 'First Dude' Once she formally announces her campaign, Clinton, like all major presidential hopefuls, will no doubt be making an appearance on the show, which this week was hosted by Empire star Tarji P. Henson. However she has been targeted by Saturday Night Live many times before. Just four weeks ago she was skewered on opening sketch following revelations over her personal emails. At the beginning of a mock interview the politician describes herself as a 'relatable woman on a couch'. 'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? 'Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi'.' Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley took to Twitter on Sunday after the actress playing Clinton compared him to a 'Simpsons character' during the sketch . Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.' Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat.' When she announces she will likely become the overwhelming favorite to win her party's nomination, with no stiff opponents expected to face her in the primaries. She will inevitably have a number of celebrity backers who will stage fundraisers for her in the coming months with reports suggesting she is looking to raise $1.1billion - double the amount Obama spent on his re-election campaign in 2012. Among them are high-profile Hollywood backers including director Steven Spielberg, and actors George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks. The November 2016 election will emphasize her plans to address economic inequality and will tout the historic nature of her bid to become the first woman U.S. president, aides have said. 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back,' says Hillary in the end of the skit . Clinton will also have to quell a controversy over her work use of a private email account while secretary of state, which Republicans have said is a sign of her penchant for secrecy. Clinton has said she used the single email account for convenience and should have used government email, but violated no rules. Clinton, who lost a heavyweight Democratic nominating battle to Barack Obama in 2008, will announce her campaign on video and social media, a Democrat familiar with her plans said. She will travel later in the week to Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest in early 2016. In a memo made public on Saturday, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told staff while the goal was for Clinton to win the presidency, the campaign was not about her. 'We are humble: we take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always out-compete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states,' he said in the campaign memo, titled 'We Are Hillary for America.' Many Democrats have eagerly awaited Sunday's announcement since the day in June 2008 when Clinton pulled out of her primary battle against Obama with an expression of regret that she could not crack 'that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time.' Opinion polls show Clinton has a huge lead over potential 2016 Democratic rivals, and few are expected to enter the race. A Reuters-Ipos tracking poll shows Clinton backed by more than 60 percent of Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of liberals but who says she is not running, is a distant second at 18 percent. So far, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and former U.S. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose support languishes in single digits in polls, are the most prominent contenders to take steps toward challenging her. Republicans have been gearing up for the battle, and a big field of Republican presidential contenders is expected. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have been the first to formally enter the race, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will jump in on Monday. Clinton operatives have already begun reaching out to top bundlers to urge them to start calling people in their donor networks, a source familiar with the matter said. At least one West Coast bundler began making calls to top donors this past week, and will place another round of calls after the announcement Sunday, the source said. She also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders. In New York on Saturday, at the final event put on by 'Ready for Hillary,' a group not connected with her campaign that's worked for the past few years to stoke excitement for it, enthusiastic supporters joined elected officials and local party leaders to celebrate the launch to come. 'After she left the State Department she could have slipped into grandmother-hood, but people want to call her back into public service,' said Jarret Berg, 29, a Democratic staffer in the New York legislature. 'It's time for her.' As her official announcement loomed, the Republican National Committee linked Clinton to Obama, a regular focus of criticism from the GOP. 'All Hillary Clinton is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown Washington instead of the middle class,' RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement Saturday. 'That's why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction, not four more years of Obama's failed policies.' Clinton (pictured on UN Woman's day on March 10 addressing the email scandal) is expected to be the clear front runner from the Democratic nomination ."}

A friend insists Fredric Brandt was offended by a character on Tina Fey's new TV show that bore uncanny similarities to him - despite initial claims he 'laughed it off'. The cosmetologist killed himself on Easter Sunday, weeks after the March 6 launch of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix. In it, Martin Short plays a caricatured white-haired cosmetologist called Dr Franff with an inordinate amount of fillers in his face. Friends admit Brandt identified the resemblance - but most claim he jovially pointed it out and laughed. However, another friend, hair colorist Kyle White, told the New York Times his reaction was a front. 'He never thought it was fun,' White told the paper. 'He was about putting on a happy face in public.' The character has been targeted as a 'breaking point' for Brandt, who had allegedly started spending his Saturday nights at home injecting himself with fillers. One of his clients and friends Rosemary Hayt told the paper she spotted syringes for fillers in his bathroom at home in Chelsea, New York. She said: 'I thought, \"Oh, Fred, this isn't a good thing to be doing alone on a Saturday night.\" 'It was disturbing thing, and I didn't want to think about it.' According to a growing body of voices, this worrying behavior was exacerbated by The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Sources close to Brandt said the doctor, who suffered from depression, told People magazine he was 'definitely hurt' by an apparent portrayal of himself on the Netflix show. The friend called the Kimmy Schmidt send up 'bullying,' but added that it did not cause his suicide. Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show. A friend speaking to People said: 'It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying. '...It wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. It definitely hurt him. He was absolutely upset, who would want that? But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help.' Another source, speaking to the New York Daily News, said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients. The source said: 'He worked 15-hour days, his office was jam-packed, and I paid him a compliment. He was so sensitive he started to cry. He said how awful the public was, and how mean people are. He was really affected by negative feedback.' Scroll down for videos . Discovery: Dr. Brandt was found by a friend inside his home early on Sunday morning having taken his own life . Startling resemblance: Dr 'Franff' (played by Martin Short) – his name was Grant, but Franff is how he pronounced it due to all the surgery and injectables he'd presumably had - is lampooned in Tina Fey's Netflix show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Brandt worked with stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Jane Holzer. Left, the doctor is pictured with morning show host Kelly Ripa in 2011 at his Dr Fredric Brandt's SiriusXM launch and right, with comedian Joy Behar at the same event . Speaking out: Jeff Richmond, left in New York City today, spoke out on Monday over the death of Dr Fredric Brandt. The plastic surgeon was reportedly upset over his portrayal in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which Richmond's wife Tina Fey, right with Martin Short, created and for which Richmond has producing credits . A police report into the tragic passing of the celebrity plastic surgeon revealed Brandt was suffering suicidal tendencies for just 10 days before he killed himself. Brandt was discovered hanged inside the garage of his Coconut Grove home by his friend, John Joseph Hupert, at around 9.15am on Easter Sunday morning. According to the police report, Hupert was concerned for his friend and was staying with the doctor because he was suicidal. The last time Hupert said he had seen Brandt alive was around 11.30pm on Saturday. The police report says that Brandt's psychiatrist Dr Saida Koita had become so worried for her patients state of mind that she ordered Hupert to stay with him to monitor him. She also revealed she had him on daily medication and was seeing him everyday for therapy sessions. When DailyMail.com asked Tina Fey's husband Jeff Richmond about Brandt's death near his home in New York City's Upper West Side, he said he hadn't been aware of it. Richmond is an executive producer and music composer on his wife's show. He said: 'That's very sad. I don't know anything about it. I just got home. Tina might know, I don't. She's not home.' Brandt was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry, with high-profile stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Kelly Ripa. The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami where he lived alone with his dogs.

Successful businessman: Dermatologist Dr. Frederic Brandt poses for a portrait with his newest additions to his skin-care line in 2013 . Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy. Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt . Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma, The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality. The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Brandt grew up in Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments."}

Pretty Agnese Klavina, 30, vanished after being driven away from celebrity Puerto Banus haunt Aqwa Mist on September 6 last year. Older sister Gunta fought back tears as she described her sister as 'very beautiful' and spoke of her despair at the lack of news. Tearful: Older sister Gunta has made an emotional video appeal for information about Agnese's whereabouts . Blonde beauty: Agnese travelled to Marbella to start a summer job at the Ocean Club in Marbella, was wearing a multi-coloured halter neck dress and carrying a large white Louis Vuitton handbag when she left the club . Suspicion: Multi-millionaire property developer's son Westley Capper (left) and pal Craig Porter (right) were summoned to court on Monday in nearby Marbella . Looking pale-faced and drawn and speaking in a faltering voice, the 31-year-old said: 'It's been over seven months since she went missing and we don't know anything about her. 'I beg you. If anyone knows anything about her whereabouts or what happened to her that night, please provide us with this information and we will give this information to the police. 'We have heard that she left the nightclub with some English people. Please if you have heard, if you can imagine how I feel, how her mother feels, please give us some information about her.' Gunta's heartbreaking video appeal emerged hours after multi-millionaire property developer's son Westley Capper, 37, and pal Craig Porter, 33, were summoned to court on Monday in nearby Marbella. The pair, who are being investigated on suspicion of Agnese's illegal detention after a damning police report based on CCTV footage claimed she did not leave the club voluntarily, refused to answer questions about the case. A secrecy order imposed on the case was removed and a huge police file  released to the family's lawyer. Marbella-based judge Sergio Luis Martin indicated at Monday's hearing - which took place behind closed doors - that he would be happy to meet Agnese's family and brief them on his findings so far. Missing: Friends reported Agnese missing the week of her disappearance along with her mum and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages . The judge is now expected to order new DNA tests on a human hair found inside the boot of the Mercedes privately-educated Capper has admitted to driving Latvian-born Agnese away from the club in. Samples taken from a motorboat belonging to Capper's family - which police fear may have been used to dispose of Agnese's body if she is dead - are also expected to be analysed using DNA from her mum. Overweight expat Capper - whose Essex-born dad John specialises in buying and selling luxury properties around the world - has had travel restrictions imposed on him while the investigation against him continues. He is claiming he dropped off Agnese, whose boyfriend Michael Millis is a former owner of west London club Westbourne Studios, near a flat she was staying at for the summer close to the home of former England manager Fabio Capello. Porter, from Liverpool, says he fell asleep on the back seat of the car they left the club in before the drop-off. Forensic experts were unable to discover who the hair in the boot of the car belonged to during during initial tests following a sweep of the vehicle. Agnese with British boyfriend Michael Millis, who travelled to Spain to help the search for the 30-year-old . The motorboat belonging to Capper's family was seized in a port in the province of Murcia, around 300 miles east of Marbella. It left a port in Fuengirola near Marbella days after Agnese vanished. A doorman at Aqwa Mist was initially arrested alongside the two current Brit suspects for allegedly obstructing police inquiries - but the case against him dropped after the trio took part in a police reconstruction of the last night Agnese was seen alive. The criminal inquiry is expected to become a homicide probe if new DNA tests show Agnese was in the boot of the car or on the motorboat. Neither suspect has yet been formally charged with any crime as is normal in Spain in the early stages of an investigation. Aqwa Mist is one of four Marbella venues owned by international restaurant brand La Sala, whose shareholders include ex-Tottenham Hotspurs winger David Bentley and defender Dean Austin.

Hollywood star Eva Longoria, American actor and singer Terence Howard, and boxer Amir Khan have partied there since its opening in June 2012. The stars of BAFTA award-winning reality TV soap opera TOWIE are also summer regulars at the club, which bills itself as Marbella's number one party venue. Lawyers acting for the two Brits refused to comment as they left court. A court official confirmed: 'Both suspects declined to answer questions from the judge. 'The investigation is ongoing.' A source close to the case said: 'The judge has indicated he will order fresh DNA tests which may involve the use of Agnese's mum's DNA. 'He had important questions to ask the suspects and obviously would have preferred it if they had agreed to cooperate with his investigation.' Capper's dad, known to friends as Fred, has made a fortune from purchasing and selling luxury properties across the world. He has modernised and sold luxury villas in fortress estates like La Zagaleta near Marbella, home to some of the world's wealthiest people. One of his companies also boasts of assets including yachts and private jets. An acquaintance, who asked not to be named, described him as 'mega-rich' and said he owned his own private plane with his name on the tail plate. He is currently understood to be based in Gibraltar. The source said: 'Westley might not look like a multi-millionaire's son but he's never wanted for anything.'

{"tokens_range": "2k", "total_prompt_tokens": 1902, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday demanded that all sanctions on Iran be lifted at the same time as any final agreement with world powers on curbing Tehran's nuclear program is reached. Khamenei, the Islamic Republic's most powerful figure and who has the last say on all state matters, was making his first comments on the interim deal reached last week in the Swiss city of Lausanne. In remarks apparently meant to keep hardline loyalists in line, he warned about 'deceptive' intentions of the United States. Reuters reported that the crowd chanted 'Death to America!' during the speech. 'Instant annulment of all sanction is one of the demands of our officials,' Khamenei said in a speech broadcast live on state television,' according to translations published by Reuters and the nonprofit Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But he hedged on whether there will be a deal in place at all by the June 30 deadline. 'I neither support nor oppose the deal, since nothing has happened yet,' he said. 'All the trouble arises when the details will be discussed; it may be that the deceptive other side wants to restrict us in the details.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO DEAL: Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Thursday that nothing is final and Iran will continue to insist on a complete withdrawal of sanctions . Khamenei tweeted his dismissal of what the White House claimed Tehran had agreed to . His stand on the lifting of sanctions matched earlier comments by President Hassan Rouhani, who said 'we will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' These include nuclear-related United Nations resolutions as well as U.S. and EU nuclear-related economic sanctions. 'All #sanctions should be removed just when the deal is reached,' Khamenei tweeted later. 'If sanctions removal depends on another process then why [have] we started to talk?' A senior Israeli defense official said in a radio interview after the speech that Iran could still obtain a nuclear weapon if sanctions were lifted immediately, and would have more money to spend on arming regional proxies. 'The moment the sanctions are removed, tens of billions [of dollars] will flow to their coffers,' Amos Gilad predicted. 'They will get rich. They will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets.' The U.S. State Department on Thursday repeated its position that sanctions against Iran would be removed gradually. 'Under the agreed-upon parameters, sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that Iran has met specific commitments,' State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said during a daily press briefing. 'We're not going to respond to every public statement made by Iranian officials,' Rathke said, 'or negotiate in public.' State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke held firm, saying 'sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that Iran has met specific commitments' One of those statements, from Khamenei, accused the White House of misleading the world with its claims of what was in the framework agreed to in Switzerland. 'Americans put out a statement just a few hours after our negotiators finished their talks ... this statement, which they called a \"fact sheet,\" was wrong on most of the issues,' Khamenei said during his speech. 'In most regards,' he claimed, it 'was faulty, incorrect and contrary to the substance of the negotiations.' In the U.S., Omri Ceren, press director at The Israel Project, told Daily Mail Online that Tehran has a good chance of winning a tug-of-war over what Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif actually agreed to. 'The Iranians have a 100 per cent record of forcing the Americans to bow to their interpretation whenever there's a dispute over Iranian concessions publicly declared by the Obama administration, including and specifically on fact sheets,' Ceren said Thurdsay. 'There's a good reason why Congress is increasingly worried, even as American negotiators assure them that they're telling the truth.' Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Daily Mail Online that up-front lifting of sanctions is a bad idea that might be put into practice anyway. 'A gradual lifting of sanctions in return for each step taken by Tehran is the only way to secure Tehran's cooperation in the future,' Alfoneh said. 'We are also concerned the Obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal, that Washington will give more concessions to Tehran,' he added.' Secretary of State John Kerry played a major role in nuclear negotiations that some observers now say are unraveling quickly . Khamenei claimed Thursday that the White House had lied about the substance of talks in Switzerland . Another area in which the parties seem to disagree is the question of monitoring and access to Iran's nuclear sites. While Kerry and Obama have emphasized expectations that Iran will let International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors tour and inspect their facilities at any time, Khamenei threw cold water on the idea. 'Any unconventional inspection or monitoring which would make Iran into a special case,' he said Thursday, 'would not be acceptable.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn’t allowed,' he added on Twitter. Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan also told the state-run FARS news agency on Thursday that Iran had not agreed to let international inspectors enter its nuclear facilities, which are typically enclosed on military installations. Ali Alfoneh of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said his group is 'concerned the Obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal, that Washington will give more concessions to Tehran' 'No such agreement has been made,' Dehquan said. 'Principally speaking, visit to military centers is among our redlines and no such visit will be accepted.' Khamenei and Rouhani spoke during a ceremony on Thursday marking Iran's National Day of Nuclear Technology. 'Our goal in the talks is to preserve our nation's nuclear rights,' Rouhani said. 'The Iranian nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations.' The U.S. and EU sanctions have choked off nearly 1.5 million barrels of Iranian exports per day since early 2012, reducing its daily oil exports by 60 percent to around 1 million barrels. The tentative accord was a step towards a settlement that would allay Western fears that Iran could build an atomic bomb, with economic sanctions on Tehran being lifted in return. Negotiators from Iran, the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China will resume negotiations in the coming days to pave the way for a final deal. Since relations with Washington collapsed after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, enmity towards the United States has always been a rallying point for Iranian hardliners. 'I was never optimistic about negotiating with America... nonetheless I agreed to the negotiations and supported, and still support, the negotiators,' Khamenei said, . 'I support a deal that preserves the interests and honor of Iran.' The United States and its Western allies say it is vital that Iran fully cooperate with a U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation into past nuclear activities that could be related to making weapons. Israeli defense official Amos Gilad predicted that when Iranian sanctions are dropped, 'they will get rich' and 'will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets' Khamenei is now saying no foreign inspectors, including those from the IAEA, will be allowed to tour the military facilities where Iran's nuclear operations are housed . Khamenei ruled out any 'extraordinary supervision measures' over Iran's nuclear activities. 'Iran's military sites cannot be inspected under the excuse of nuclear supervision,' he said. A final deal would require a vigorous monitoring framework to ensure Iranian compliance. The negotiators have been working out a monitoring mechanism that would involve the IAEA. This has not been considered a sticking point in the nuclear talks. France, which has demanded more stringent conditions on Iran, said the comments by the Iranian leadership showed that reaching a final deal would be difficult and that in any case there would need to be a mechanism in place to restore sanctions if Tehran violated its commitments. 'Subjects still remain that we aren't agreed on, notably on economic sanctions, and the Supreme Leader has made statements that show there is still a lot of work to be done,' Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told lawmakers. 'We are going to keep the position we have held from the beginning, which is constructive but extremely demanding,' Fabius said. Khamenei also said the tentative deal did not guarantee reaching a comprehensive deal by a June 30 deadline. 'What has been achieved so far does not guarantee a deal or even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' Khamenei said, adding that an extension of the deadline should not be a problem. He then reiterated Iranian denials that Tehran was seeking to build a nuclear weapon."}

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for £130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out £130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget £19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of £19.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, £130: Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At £130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of £130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, £19.99: The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for £14.99 in 2013. Aldi's £19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At £19.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the £130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts."}

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites."}

Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to obesity - which she says leaves her so tired that she falls asleep unexpectedly. The 21-year-old, who put on 13 stone in four years by eating through 'boredom', has not worked for five years because she says she would be a 'danger' in the workplace. Pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance has now warned that the benefit system should not become a 'comfort blanket' and that people should 'get themselves in shape' to work. Scroll down for video . Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson (left and right) claims £18,000 in benefits because she suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to excessive weight - which leaves her so tired that she can't stay awake . Ms Coulson told MailOnline: 'I can't work because of my condition. If I was sat in an office, I would just fall asleep and the manager will end up sacking me. 'It's not just that, but I could make something go wrong, couldn't I? By falling asleep and making a mistake. Who knows what buttons I would press or what would happen? It wouldn't be fair on my colleagues.' Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she needs a state-funded support worker to write her meal plans. Instead, she continues to claim £18,712 a year in benefits - the equivalent of a £22,000 taxable salary - which is more than a nurse's starting wage and the same pay as a newly-qualified teacher. She added: 'I would love to have a job, I didn't chose to be like this. But I can't. I'm too dangerous. I can't do anything if I'm falling asleep the whole time.' Ms Coulson, who lives alone in New Milton, Hampshire, said she has always battled with her weight. However, her weight spiralled out of control after she left home four years ago. Unable to get a job due to being signed off with depression, the young woman started eating up to ten packs of crisps per day because she was 'bored'. She would also have an evening takeaway - and had soon put on 13 stone. Ms Coulson, pictured with her mother Lynda, 50, says she would like to work if she were able to do so . Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she can only do that with a state-funded support worker to help her write meal plans . She said: 'I developed depression and that just made me eat more. I would have takeaways most nights. I ate a lot, including chocolate and crisps. It was a way of coping.' Sleep apnoea is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, which interrupts normal breathing and can stop someone getting a decent night's sleep. Ms Coulson, who is 5ft 6in, claims the condition leaves her so tired that she cannot travel to work, incase she drifts off to sleep and misses her bus stop. She also says she is not allowed to drive incase she nods off at the wheel. Rochelle Coulson is entitled to a raft of benefits every month which means she has not had to work for five years. Every month she is entitled to: . Total: £18, 712 . The 21-year-old is supposed to use a Continuous Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) to help her sleep during the night. But she decided not to use it because she claims she cannot travel to the doctors for a check-up. She has also been offered half-price gym membership by the NHS to help her lose weight - but says she cannot use it because it is too painful to walk. Despite this, Ms Coulson says the NHS could be doing a lot more to help her. She said: 'Yes I do feel there is more out there to help me and the NHS could have done better. 'They haven't done enough to help me tackle my weight. It would be nice to have a check-up each week, or month, when me and the doctor sit down and write a meal plan. Or they could try and get me a support worker. 'I am supposed to have a CPAP machine to help but I do not use it because I can't get back to hospital for a check-up. 'I can't go to hospital because I can't go on public transport as I will fall asleep and my mum can't always be there with me. I can't drive either because of my condition.' Ms Coulson said she started applying for jobs when she first finished college at the age of 18. But she was soon diagnosed with depression and told she was not capable of working. In December 2012, she was then diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Now, she claims she can drop off to sleep unexpectedly for up to six hours per day, meaning she relies on repeat sick notes to claim her state handouts. But in June last year, Ms Coulson was struck off from a GP surgery when her mother Lynda, 50, asked for a three-month note which the doctor refused. When the doctor offered to give her a one-month note instead, the pair were banned for being 'verbally abusive'. Ms Coulson then had to be 'interviewed' before being rejected by another surgery. In November, she was finally signed off for five months, after signing up to her third GP. The 21-year-old, who spends her days playing on Facebook, has not had a job for five years because she says she cannot stay awake . This healthy meal of carrots, potatoes, chicken and salad, recently posted by Ms Coulson, is an alternative to her usual takeaways and crisps . In total, Ms Coulson gets £411 in Personal Independence Payment a month, as well as £260 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) a fortnight. Her £135 a week rent is also covered through housing benefit. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net, and those with genuine conditions must of course be caught by it, but it can never become a comfort blanket and we must ask individuals to get themselves in shape to work. 'Taxpayers cannot afford to support individuals who simply choose not to work, so the authorities must be strict about who is deemed 'fit to work' or not. Ultimately, the benefit system has to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves.' Ms Coulson is now trying to lose weight by swapping her takeaways for healthy alternatives. She hopes that by losing some weight that she will be able to become more active. Nurse starting salary: £21,388. This job requires students to complete a three-year degree at university. Nurses then work a complex shift pattern, including weekends, evenings and nights. Teacher starting salary: £22,023. This requires the person to complete an undergraduate degree - usually three years long - and a one-year PGCE. Alternatively, the trainee teacher can complete an intensive year-long school-centred initial teacher training course on the job (SCITT). Care home worker: Between £14,000 and £18,000. This usually requires someone to complete a diploma in health and social care, as well as to undertake training and courses while on the job. She said: 'At the moment, it's hard for me to do everyday things like getting out of bed. The hardest is getting out of my mum's couch. It hurts my hips to lift myself out, because the sofa is broken due to my weight. 'My back also can't cope with standing for too long because of my weight, which means it very painful to walk.' She added: 'I'm dropping things like crisps and chocolate and replacing it with low fat Greek yoghurt. I used to eat takeaways on a regular basis but now I don't. 'Once I've shifted some, I can hopefully get out a little more.' Ms Coulson also said she had a blood test last week which showed she is borderline diabetic and has an underactive thyroid, for which she is now taking medication. A DWP spokesman said: 'Being obese in itself does not entitle a person to disability benefits, although the associated long-term health effects may. 'Decisions on whether a person is entitled to disability benefits are based on thorough assessments and consideration of any medical evidence, including from their GP.'"}

Your average package holiday won't do for these youngsters who travel by private jet, sleep in presidential suites, wake up to scrambled eggs topped with truffles - and spend the rest of the day lounging on a luxurious yacht. MailOnline caught up with the world's most extravagant 18 to 26-year-olds who blew their cash in Miami, New York, Marbella and Monaco to name but a few cities before indulging in their stratospheric nightlife during Spring Break. While the glamorous Scolaro sisters 'partied with A-list movie stars', self-made millionaire Tomer Sror continued to earn hundreds of thousands in minutes over online trades – even when he was sunbathing on the beach. And their message to the 'haters' remains exactly the same: 'Keep watching and enjoying. There is more to come.' Scroll down for video . Jet-setter: 'Sometimes it's not about where you go, but rather how you get there,' says Marcus W.A. as he boards a £2 million private jet . Travel in style: For 25-year-old Andreas Arnhoff from Norway it is more about the journey - on a luxury yacht - than the destination which just so happens to be the gorgeous beaches of Miami . Glamorous: And when she needs to get to the other end of Monaco or Milan, Lana Scolaro (pictured) takes a pristine Bentley Continental . Loaded: Online trader and workaholic Tomer Sror travels light with one of his many passports, his $1,000 Hermes loafers and piles of cash . Businesswoman: Having grown up between New York, Monaco and London, with her sister Stephanie (right), 20-year-old fashion designer Lana Scolaro (left) knows nothing but the jet-set lifestyle . Whether on a £2million Phenom E100 private jet or a brand new Bentley Continental, they travel in style. And no one does it quite like 18-year-old Marcus W.A. who 'constantly needs to be on the move' and hates being in 'one place for two weeks'. In the last two months alone, the native New-Yorker has flown to Costa Rica, Nantucket, Boston, The Hamptons and Switzerland, where he stayed in the famous Badrutt's Palace and skied every single day. But not before heading down to Louis Vuitton to pick up a gold and brown document holder worth over £750 which has made several appearances on his opulent Instagram account. The young investor says it's not all fun, games and champagne - telling MailOnline: 'I wouldn't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while I travel I'm not just sitting there and relaxing I'm always networking or doing meetings. 'But the concept that life is just one long fun trip that is constantly moving around definitely can describe my mindset.' 20-year-old Lana Scolaro and her sister Stephanie - who have been travelling back and forth between countries since they were young children - have become pretty used to the jet-setting lifestyle. Lana told MailOnline: 'We were just in LA partying with our usual crowd and a lot of the same friends we hang with in Saint Bart's. 'We hung out at the Beverly Hills Hotel a lot with some friends who are actors we'd prefer not to name, and went to some cool house parties in the hills.' But Tomer Sror who describes himself as a self-made man believes vacations should be spent relaxing with a beautiful girl. He told MailOnline: 'Unlike the other kids I have had to work for the money so ''vacation'' is what I do. I can't just be away all the time because I'm running a business but I still try to take time off as much as I can.' High-fliers: While most 20-somethings would shack up in a local hostel, the jet-setting Scolaro sisters spend their vacations in Monaco in the Cafe . Scenic: And instead of hiring a cheap rental car for a cross-country road trip, Andreas Arnhoff does the trip in his Porsche Turbo before enjoying a beautiful panoramic view of Oslo fjord . Wish you were here: 20-year-old businesswoman Lana Scolaro says she travels to promote her jewellery business as much as to have an adventure . Can't stop: Marcus W.A. who 'constantly needs to be on the move' used his mind-blowing trip to Machu Pichu in Peru to satisfy his need not to be 'one place for two weeks' Playtime: After spending time in Los Angeles and London, Lana was delighted to be back in her 'playground' of Monte Carlo . Unlike most 23-year-olds who would book into a local hostel, he spent his time between the presidential suites of the Elysium in Rhodes which set him back around £1,000-a-night and the Eilat in Israel which costs at least £500-a-night. For Lana who grew up between New York, London and Monaco, travelling both a hobby and a necessity to promote her luxury jewellery company Lana Scolaro Diamonds around the world. She said: 'In the last few months I've invested a lot into my new up and coming Jewellery collection which involves rare sapphires, rubies, emeralds and diamonds.' And despite his own desire to unwind and relax, even Tomer takes time away from the jet-ski and presidential suite to make a quick '209k profit'. The online trader's Instagram account is packed with huge piles of cash in different currencies and screenshots of his enormously lucrative trades. Following a post of Tomer asleep on a bed of money is a which suggests he made a staggering €209,000 in a single day. He told MailOnline: 'Money never sleeps and too much is never enough. I admit that I work a lot. I don't like being lazy. I'm very motivated and always wish to grow more and expend.' Same is the case for globe-trotting Marcus who told MailOnline: 'I wouldn't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while I travel I'm not just sitting there and relaxing I'm always networking or doing meetings!'

Big money: Self-made Israeli businessman Tomer Sror can't bare to leave the office at home and manages to make a quick few hundred thousand while on vacation . Stunning: The Scolaro sisters Lana (left) and Stephanie (right) still manage to fit in a bike ride on Venice Beach in between their many meetings . Despite the extreme levels of wealth he flaunts on his social media site, the 18-year-old insists he is not out to make people jealous or infuriate the so-called 'haters' - but to inspire people to reach higher. He said: 'To me I think anyone who takes Instagram that serious is just being silly. My followers like luxury content and inspiration to do better and when I can give that content its great. 'I hope that all my followers are happy with the content I bring to them and with every like and every comment I am motivated to keep it up. In addition, keep in mind there are certainly people out there who are crazier than me and spend much, much more and whenever I look at their pages I don't get mad. Norwegian real-estate developer Andreas once joked that he preferred his Porsche Cayenne Turbo over his exquisite Rolls Royce 'for the comfort'. He previously ran the marketing department in the family business and used his savings - and a little borrowed cash from the family - to buy his apartment in Oslo, Norway. He has been spending his Spring Break relaxing on his yacht in Miami harbour, enjoying Florida's beautiful open golf courses and road-tripping across Europe in his pristine Porsche. Mile high: Marcus even relaxes in style wearing his vintage Ray Bans and expensive time piece in the back of a £2million personal jet . Chilling: Andreas' choice of hang-out spot after a yacht ride and a round of golf in Miami isn't too shabby either, as he stretches his legs in the Marquis residence in Miami where apartments cost up to £3.2million . Sunset cocktail: What better way to relax and watch the sunset after a busy day of business meetings in Malibu than dinner at the exclusive Nobu restaurant rooftop . Cheers: And Tomer who says he is 'unlike the other kids' because he 'had to work for the money' says there is nothing better than using your vacation to kick back and relax ."}

But unlikely as it may seem, Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, aren't the only pair to have found their real-life doppelgängers, either by mistake or after a social media hunt. Now three similar British cases have been revealed; a London-based journalist who found hers in Birmingham, two male university students, also in London, and two retired men in Essex. Scroll down for video . What are the odds? Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, (right) moved to Braintree in Essex to be confronted with his doppelgänger, former head teacher John Jemison, 74, (left) Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old TV presenter from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' last week in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, moved to Braintree and was surprised to greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings wherever he went. 'John' turned out to be John Jemison, a 74-year-old former head teacher who was well-known to the town, and just so happened to look exactly like Mr Richardson. Upon meeting, the pair, who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised that as well as being doppelgängers, they had an awful lot in common. Both had attended the same college, and both became RE teachers and choir singers. The pair finally came face-to-face in March when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a Friends of Braintree Museum visit to the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library. 'It was quite spooky,' said Mr Jemison, adding that they 'hit it off immediately' and are now friends. 'My only worry is the number of people who probably think I've been ignoring them when they've been saying \"Hello John\" to Neil all this time.' Upon meeting, Mr Richardson (left) and Mr Jemison (right), who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised they  had a lot in common in terms of their life stories . Mr Richardson married his wife in 1968 (left) while Mr Jemison also married wife Jenny in the sixties (right) In 2011, Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her. In fact, she was the inspiration behind Miss Geaney's ultimately successful social media search. In much the same way, Ms Robehmed launched her mission to find her doppelgänger by publicising it on Facebook, YouTube, and through blogs around the world. And just like Miss Geaney, it turned out that Ms Robehmed didn't need to look that far. Her closest match turned out to be Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher, who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend. Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed (right) launched a hunt to find her 'twin stranger' in 2011 and found Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher (left) through a mutual friend . After seeing Ms Hatcher's photo, Miss Robehmed set up a meeting in Covent Garden in London, and the rest is history. And in another accidental result, doppelgängers Jonny Sandgrove and Michael Harris, both based in London, got to know each other at university. As cases of mistaken identity around the campus began to mount up, the pair met, again though mutual acquaintances, and ultimately became firm friends. Doppelgängers Jonny Sandgrove (left) and Michael Harris (right), both based in London, got to know each other at University, after friends kept getting them confused . When Mr Harris married his then-girlfriend Naomi a little while later, several members of his family approached Johnny at the wedding to congratulate him. All this comes after Miss Geaney and Miss Branigan's story blew up across the media yesterday, for being the most twin-like case yet. Miss Geaney, a TV presenter, found Miss Branigan after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called Twin Strangers. This is the moment that Miss Geaney (right) met her doppleganger Miss Branigan (left) for the first time . 'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Miss Geaney (right) said about Miss Branigan (left) The aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website TwinStrangers from across the world. Incredibly, Miss Geaney found Miss Branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away. After their first meeting she said: ‘I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face. ‘And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, “Oh my God that’s my face”. I can’t remember the number of times I said “this is so freaky”. It was truly amazing. Uncanny: Miss Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Miss Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . ‘I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,’ said Miss Geaney. ‘But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.’ Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Geaney has two sisters and a brother, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Miss Branigan (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Miss Geaney (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \"Oh my God that’s my face\"' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!' Miss Geaney (right) said she and Miss Branigan (left) got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities (pictured) Friends for life? Since meeting, Miss Geaney (right) and Miss Branigan (left) - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly' Feedback: Shocked reactions to  their story have flooded in from far and wide . Challenge: Miss Geaney's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelgängers, and the search isn't over until April 27 . Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'"}

Dumped on the side of a busy road outside Southampton, emaciated and riddled with worms, he was shivering pitifully in the January chill and clinging to life by a thread. His rescuers called him Rupert: a teddy bear name for a teddy bear temperament. Despite what he has endured, Rupert is a loving, affectionate soul who likes nothing more than to have the back of his head rubbed. To see him today, three months on but still unsteady on his feet, it seems heartless beyond belief that anyone could leave such a vulnerable creature to die. Sixteen-year-old Elise, from Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire, is just one of the many people finding that they can no longer keep up with the financial costs of keeping and looking after a horse . But, sadly, stories like Rupert’s are all too common. Across the country, horses, ponies and donkeys — many of them once much-loved family pets — are being abandoned in record numbers and left to fend for themselves or tied up on busy roadsides in the hope that someone will rescue them. Animal welfare charities, meanwhile, are full to capacity, leaving them increasingly helpless in the wake of the hundreds of calls they receive every month about neglected or abandoned horses. Earlier this month, in desperation, the RSPCA launched an urgent appeal to rehome some of the hundreds of horses in their care. Their three sanctuaries, with capacity for 640 horses, are full, with 500 other horses being kept at huge expense in private boarding stables while they wait for a place. Three thousand more, meanwhile, are estimated to be at risk, although the real number could be much higher. Last year, the RSPCA alone took in 1,500 horses, many of them former family pets. Little wonder that the word RSPCA workers are using to describe the situation is ‘crisis’. As Anna Hemmings, centre manager at Lockwood, one of their three animal centres, puts it, trying to provide care for the ever-growing numbers of needy equines is a ‘constant battle’. ‘The moment we rehome a horse another one steps into its place,’ she says. ‘I have been here for four years and every year the problem has got worse.’ Sara Cooper, 33, a trainee agricultural assistant from Wiltshire, says that since an accident which hurt her back she can no longer ride her horse Pip, and as a result can't afford to keep him either . It’s hard to argue with the numbers, which all equine welfare organisations say have risen steadily in the recession, and continue to do so, despite the economy improving. Dene Stansall, a horse consultant for campaign group Animal Aid, says that many people remain unable to afford the minimum £3,000 cost per year to keep a horse — a sum that can soar if there are veterinary bills. Yet those who bought a horse years ago and are now struggling to afford it, find they have no one to sell to. ‘There is no demand or buoyancy in the market compared with seven or eight years ago,’ says Dene. ‘People might afford a new TV, but they can’t commit to the long-term care of an animal.’ Sara's horse Pip (pictured) is one of the many family pets who find themselves either being sold on by owners who can no longer afford to keep them, or abandoned by those who fail to find them a new home . Reluctant to sell their horses to abattoirs, many owners mistakenly believe that leaving them to fend for themselves on a patch of land such as a roadside verge — a common practice known as fly-grazing, which is illegal — is the better option. In reality, however, most horses cannot survive for long without human care. The problem is that more and more owners are taking on horses without preparation. Mother-of-four Teresa Christie, from Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire, is the first to admit she was naive about horse ownership — and as a result has been left frantically trying to find a home for her 16-year-old daughter Elise’s Irish cob Beau, without success. ‘None of us realised the financial commitment of owning a horse,’ says Teresa. ‘We didn’t have any land so found him a field and stables which cost £80 a month.’ Then there is Beau’s food and hay, which can cost up to £100 a month, and the regular £30 charge to keep his hooves trimmed. ‘We’ve at least been lucky that he’s been healthy, so the vet bills have been low, but vaccinations are still £260 a year,’ she says. ‘It began to get more and more of a stretch to care for him.’ Sara's back pain forced her to give up her beloved horse Pip (pictured together left). 'On average, I was paying £160 a month to rent a field and a stable. It was £10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days' The situation reached crisis point last summer — by when Teresa had taken a part-time cleaning job to help fund Beau’s care, while Elise had started work as a trainee hairdresser to help out, too. ‘But it still wasn’t enough money. I thought: “I can’t do this any more” — I’ve got four children and there are other priorities,’ says Teresa. ‘It’s been a difficult decision, but the truth is Beau is a luxury we can’t afford.’ So, earlier this year, the family made the reluctant decision to put him up for sale. Yet months on, there still have been no takers — though the family is adamant they will not abandon him. Teresa’s experience chimes with that of Sara Cooper, 33, a trainee agricultural assistant from Wiltshire. The mother-of-two has always loved riding her 20-year-old horse Pip, but last year had to stop after being kicked by a cow, leaving her with back pain. ‘Riding now exacerbates the pain and I simply can’t afford to keep a horse that I can’t ride,’ she says. ‘On average, I was paying £160 a month to rent a field and a stable. It was £10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days.’ Long-time rider Melanie Maddocks, a 54-year-old self-employed carer from Barnstable, Devon, says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14-year-old cob, Connie . And so, like Teresa, she had to make the painful decision to get rid of Pip, selling him to a family in Buckinghamshire. The price of hay has risen far beyond inflation, with some farmers putting up a bale by £5. It is a cost hitting busy animal sanctuaries harder than ever. Fiona Oakes, who runs Tower Hill Stables Animal Sanctuary in Tillingham, Essex, is overseeing 50 abandoned or neglected horses. ‘We have had them left tied up outside the Sanctuary gates,’ says Fiona, 48. ‘We’ve found horses in such a pitiful state that it makes you want to weep.’ Like the beautiful Palomino pony, found in a coal shed, skeletally thin, cast aside when she was too old to be ridden. ‘She would have been every little girl’s fantasy in her prime, but once she had outlived her usefulness she ended up in this appalling state,’ says Fiona. ‘It was heartbreaking.’ Melanie found it so difficult to find a buyer for horse Connie, at one point she considered having her put to sleep. 'The thought broke my heart, but I didn’t know what to do,’ she says . Long-time rider Melanie Maddocks, a 54-year-old self-employed carer from Barnstable, Devon, says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14-year-old cob, Connie, who she couldn’t afford alongside her other horse, Flossie. At one point last year, she became so overwhelmed that she contemplated having Connie put to sleep. ‘The thought broke my heart, but I didn’t know what to do,’ she says. In the end, after many frantic phone calls, Melanie found a local stud farm, who took Connie to breed from. ‘I was lucky, although it was devastating. But a lot of people abandon their horses as they don’t know what else to do and think it’s the kinder option.’ Well-meaning or not, fly-grazing is now heartbreakingly common and many owners do not comply with laws requiring them to microchip their horses, making tracing them impossible. So it is left to animal sanctuaries to take in the poor creatures — if they are discovered in time to save them."}

Images revealed Fiery Cross Reef virtually untouched by man-made structures in March 2014 but by March this year, it had been transformed into an artificial island. They followed equally disturbing photographs released earlier this month showing a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built island on the nearby Mischief Reef.

Territory: The area near the Spratly Islands (pictured) where China is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region .

Disputed: China has built the airstrip (pictured) on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands without consulting the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan who all claim the region . 'We have compelling reasons to raise our voice to tell the whole world the adverse effects of China's aggressiveness,' Catapang told reporters, describing the reclamation and construction activities as 'massive'. Catapang said this was causing concern 'not only because it would deter freedom of navigation, but also due to its possibility of military purposes'. Edward Schwarck, Research Fellow in Asia Studies at defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said that the installations China is building could lead to military conflict. He told MailOnline: ‘Assertive behaviour from China in this region is not a new thing. Chinese maritime law enforcement vessels have been harassing fishermen and US vessels for years. ‘The concern is that they give the Chinese military the ability to project force and sovereignty much better into the South China Sea. They could be used as launch pads for law enforcement vessels and harassing operations of other countries in the region. ‘These have been very provocative in the past and the installations mean more ships, that in turn escalates conflict.’ He added: ‘As they stand they’re not a threat. In a military conflict these sorts of installations would be sitting ducks. The concern is what it signifies about China’s long-term intentions.’ China claims most of the potentially energy-rich South China . Sea, disputed in parts with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, . Brunei and Taiwan, and denies accusations its actions in its own . territory are provocative. General Catapang showed journalists surveillance photographs of construction work at Johnson, Fiery Cross, Cuarteron, Kennan and Gaven reefs. He added: 'Our biggest problem now is the Mischief Reef. This is worrisome. This is our main . concern now. This is the issue that we are now trying to . address. 'We feel that we are in a very difficult situation. If they reclaim the Mischief Reef, we will be cut off. We have a series of islands going down south and going up north. It will challenge the Ayungin Shoal that we are claiming. Military troops from the Philippines and United States hold up their respective national flags during opening rites of the Philippines-US Exercise Balikatan in Quezon City, east of Manila . Force: Following their release, U.S. President Barack Obama accused China of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the South China Sea . Worrying: A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation in the South China Sea (pictured) is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts . Territory: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands (pictured) and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty' Ownership: China claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea . The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. There are soldiers there and if this happens, they are very near each other. I hope there will be no miscalculations or aggressiveness on both sides.'

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, which . begins on Friday. In an interview with AFP last week, President Aquino said the world should fear China's actions in the disputed sea, warning they could lead to military conflict. The United States' military commander for Asia has said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region, which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone. China's ambassador to the United States has said it was 'natural' that his country's reclamation work would include military defence facilities. Cui Tiankai said there 'should be no illusion that anyone could... repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences'. Its actions in the South China Sea have been described as 'aggressive' by Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. He urged President Obama's administration to move more military resources into the economically important Asian region - and boost cooperation with Asian countries worried by China. Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said China had a duty to address regional concerns And his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the South China Sea for trading nations like his. China's leadership hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who recently condemned the country for constructing the artificial island on Mischief Reef. Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions'."}

An outraged mom live tweeted her son's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance. Author Alice Dreger took to Twitter to express her horror at what she heard at East Lansing High School, in Michigan, when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week. Ms Dreger, a respected professor, began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex. According to the 45 tweets sent by Ms Dreger during the lesson, stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant, people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts. 'The whole lesson here is \"sex is part of a terrible lifestyle. Drugs, unemployment, failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster\",' tweeted Ms Dreger. She added: 'I feel like raising my hand and saying \"Can I tell my sexual history, which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage?\"' Ms Dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students, who are freshmen in high school, by the teacher, who did not normally work at the school. At one point, paper babies were handed around the class to show how 'easily' condoms fail: the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times. \"We are going to roll this dice eight times,' Ms Dreger reported the teacher as saying. 'Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby.' In fact, according to the NHS, just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly. Outrage: Ms Dreger's tweets, above, show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week . Untrue: The school has denied it only teaches abstinence, saying it just happened to be that day's lesson . The tweets went viral, with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education. But the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day's lecture which focused on the subject. 'Abstinence-based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe, but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices. This parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught,' high school principal Coby Fletcher said in the statement released to The Lansing State Journal. The school has taken no direct action against Ms Dreger for the tweets. They have, however, banned her from the premises - apart from her son's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson. @alicedreger: The kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is, so I'm going.

It now goes to the full Senate, where it is could pass with a veto-proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers. The House's top vote counter on Monday said lawmakers in the lower chamber would also take up the bill after their colleagues in the Senate finished the voting process. Senators voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks, and left in a signature feature of the bill giving Congress the authority to approve a final deal with Iran that the White House earlier implied may have been on the chopping block . The Obama administration was in panic-mode this week, trying to strike a last-minute deal with legislators on both sides of the aisle that would satisfy its concerns with bill, which the White House had said as recently as yesterday that the president would 'absolutely' veto as written. While the legislative branch was in recess administration officials called 130 Members of Congress to try to persuade them not to act until the political framework that Iran agreed a week before firmed up. Officials ramped up their efforts in classified briefings with lawmakers today and yesterday. Among the White House's demands were that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee drop from the bill a requirement to for Iran to certify that it has not backed terrorism against Americans, cut down a 60-day 'window for Congress to look over a deal and 'clarify' that it is the president's 'decision to make' whether or not to enter into an agreement with Iran. It also said it wants legislators to promise that the bill currently under discussion 'would be the one and only mechanism for codifying precisely what the appropriate congressional oversight is into this matter.' 'If we arrived at a place where the bill that is passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support is essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions - not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement - that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we've expressed about the authority that is exercised by the President of the United States to conduct foreign policy,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. It is 'critical' Earnest said that the legislation that comes out of the Senate is bipartisan so that 'there isn't an untoward effort to insert a different provision into some sort of must-pass piece of legislation that could really gum up the works here.' 'And if presented with a compromise along the lines that I just laid out here, that would be the kind of compromise the president would be willing to sign,' he said. Earnest later indicated that the president's signature would be predicated on senators watering the bill down to just a vote to later vote on congressional sanctions and the inclusion of language that would make clear the proper role of congressional oversight. 'If the president were writing this piece of legislation it would look substantially different,' he said, noting that he didn't want to leave reporters with the impression that even in senators were 'willing to agree to this substantial number of changes that I've laid out here, that we're gonna be particularly thrilled about the legislation that emerges. 'I rather think what we would find ourselves with is the kind of compromise that the president would be willing to sign,' Earnest explained. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker,  the author of the bill, center, shakes hands with the committee's ranking member Sen. Ben Cardin after the committee unanimously passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 . He later expressed concern that Republican members, if given a vote on the final deal, would be 'willing to flush down the toilet the best bet that we have' in favor of carrying out air raids  on Iran, as former U.S. Ambassador John Bolton has suggested. 'Only' that kind of military action 'can accomplish what is required,' Bolton said in a March 25 New York Times op-ed. 'Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.' The bill's lead sponsor, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, during the hearing noted that as a result of 1600 Pennsylvania's last-ditch lobbying efforts, misinformation was circulating about the current language of the bill. 'This legislation is exactly the congressional review that we've been working on since day one,' he said, and had '100 percent of the integrity' senators on the committee hoped it would. Lawmakers did agree to take out the terrorism provision and to reduce the review period from 60 days to 30 days but refused to cut it out entirely. And sanctions that have been put in place, Corker explained 'cannot be lifted without the administration bringing to us every detail of the deal.' Then, he said, 'the clock will start' on the period of time Congress has to debate and decide if it wants to move ahead with a resolution of approval or disapproval - and in the meantime no sanctions can be lifted. And that's not the end of it, he explained, 'Congress stays involved.' Every 90 days, the administration would have to certify that Iran is in compliance with the accord, and if there are violations, the executive branch would have 10 days to notify Congress so it can reapply sanctions if necessary. 'So I think this puts Congress in its rightful role,' he said. The White House, sensing a legislative defeat was nigh, today said President Barack Obama would be willing to meet Congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with Iran if a Senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon. In the end, the committee decided to buck the White House . Pushing back on the administration's suggestions that supporters of the Senate legislation are warmongers, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, a key force in the bipartisan negotiations around the deal, characterized the claims as 'ridiculous' and 'offensive' during the committee meeting, . 'I’m pro-diplomacy...but I have also been strongly pro the need for congressional approval,' he posited. 'I actually think that congressional approval, in this instance under the framework that is now before us, is necessary, helpful and what the American public demands and deserves.'' Democratic Chuck Schumer, next in line for his party's top leadership role in the supper chamber, applauded Corker and ranking Democratic Senator Ben Cardin for coming to a bipartisan agreement on how to move forward. '‎I'm certainly in favor of what they've put together,' he said, throwing his support behind the bill. New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker also lent his name to the legislation this afternoon, signing on as a cosponsor. 'The United States must do everything in its power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,' he said in a statement. 'The framework deal with Iran is an important step forward in accomplishing this goal by diplomatic means. 'But as the body that imposed sanctions on Iran, Congress has a vitally important role in any process that seeks to modify them,' he added. 'The Corker-Menendez bill sets up a reasonable mechanism for Congress to have a voice in the process that will help make any agreement with Iran as strong as possible.' Fellow New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, a namesake of the bill who temporarily stepped aside as ranking member of the committee as he deals with legal troubles, said he wanted to make clear with the committee's vote it never 'envisioned a wholesale waver' of nuclear sanctions 'without congressional input.' He was responding to Iranian leaders' affirmations last week that they would not accept a deal that does not immediately terminate sanctions. The Obama administration has repeatedly said that it only ever agreed to the phased lifting of restrictions on Iran and made that clear during the last round of talks. Menendez, speaking during today's hearing before the vote, said, 'Let's send a message to Tehran that sanctions relief is not a given' and it is 'not a prize for signing on the dotted line.' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, an original co-author of the legislation, said in a statement that 'Congress should have a say in lifting the economic sanctions which Congress created.' 'Every Member of Congress needs to listen, speak, and be accountable for what I believe will be one of the most significant foreign policy decisions our nation has faced in decades,' he said. 'Either with President Obama’s signature – or over his objections – this legislation should immediately be pushed into law.'"}

The image was captured over Jaibru in Australia by an off-duty emergency services officer who dubbed the phenomenon 'looping lightning'. Upwards lightning is possible, but is very rare - with current estimates suggesting less than one per cent of lightning strikes travelling in an ‘upwards’ direction. And storm chaser Dan Robinson believes 'looped lightning' is simply a trick of perspective, based on where the viewer is stood, meaning it appears to rise and loop even though it is not. This image was captured over Jaibru in Australia by emergency services officer Scott Murray, who dubbed the phenomenon looping lightning'. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than 1% of lightning travels in an ‘upwards’ direction. But storm chaser Dan Robinson said 'looped' lighting may instead be a trick of perspective, based on where a viewer is stood, meaning it appears to loop when it's not . The 'looping lightning' image was taken by  Scott Murray and the bolt appears to shot out and up from the cloud before curving towards the Earth. Typically lightning is seen from a distance, or from the side, and it is rare to capture an image almost directly beneath a bolt. As a result, this can skew its perspective. In particular, if the bolt is travelling straight at the viewer - so they are almost looking up the length of the bolt -  it can make it appear as if it is curving because of its forked nature. There have been examples of lightning appearing to make complete circular loops, but this is also a trick of the eye. Lightning is caused by the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds. As they develop, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds. The preceding flash causes an electrical field change, which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object like a building or wind turbine. During winter snow storms, it is possible for tall objects to initiate upwards lightning without preceding flashes. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an ‘upwards’ direction. It is typically classified into three groups. The smallest are starters, which extend up to a  altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30km). Next are jets, which extend 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50km), and the last are gigantic jets, which reach 44 to 56 miles (70 to 90km). Positive charge builds up in one area of the cloud, while negative charges build up in the other - typically the top and bottom of the cloud respectively. If this build up of charge reaches a certain level, the insulating capacity of the air breaks causing the negative charges to escape or 'leap' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground. As negative charges gather in the bottom of a cloud, the negative charges in the ground are forced from the surface, leaving it positive. When a so-called 'streamer' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud, it is therefore attracted to the ground, which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up. In particular, the negative 'stepped leaders' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to Earth, with the least resistance. This is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud. As the streams connect it causes electrons to jump, or 'return the stroke', and an electrical current begins flowing, which creates lightning. This flash temporarily equalises the charged regions, until the opposite charges build up again. Lightning can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud, known as intra-cloud lightning, or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground, referred to as cloud-to-ground lightning. And there are roughly five to 10 times as many cloud flashes as there are cloud-to-ground flashes. Within these strikes are two types of ground flashes known as natural and triggered. The latter includes strikes to very tall structures, planes, rockets and towers and goes from the ground up to the cloud. Natural lightning is cloud to ground. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds. The preceding flash causes an electrical field change, which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an ‘upwards’ direction - and it is typically classified into three groups, based on peak altitude. The smallest are starters, which extend up to a maximum altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30km). Next are jets, which extend 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50km), and the last are gigantic jets, which reach 44 to 56 miles (70 to 90km). Lightning is caused by a build up of electrostatic charges. As they develop, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground. If this build up reaches a certain level, the insulating capacity of the air breaks. The negative charge 'leaps' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground (pictured) When a so-called 'streamer' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud, it is attracted to the ground, which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up. In particular, the negative 'stepped leaders' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to Earth, with the least resistance. This is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud (pictured) However, the upward movement of the lightning in Mr Murray's image doesn't appear to extend as high as other forms of upward lightning, and storm chaser Dan Robinson suggests an alternative. He explained: 'Sometimes a lightning channel will have the illusion of 'looping back' on itself or having bright knots in it. The reason behind this phenomenon is quite simple. 'Lightning is three-dimensional - it 'zigs' and 'zags' in all directions. As the streams connect, it causes electrons to jump, or 'return the stroke', and an electrical current begins flowing, which creates lightning. This flash temporarily equalises the charged regions, until the opposite charges build up again. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds . Upward lightning is typically classified into three groups. Starters extend up to an altitude of 19 miles (30km), jets extend to 31 miles (50km), and the gigantic jets reach up to 56 miles (90km). The upward movement in Mr Murray's image doesn't appear to extend this high, however, and storm chaser Dan Robinson said if part of a bolt is coming straight at you, it will appear to loop back on itself even when it's not . 'Most of the time you'll view a lightning channel from the side and it'll appear to travel in one general direction only. 'However, if that lightning bolt - or part of the lightning bolt - is coming straight at you, that is, you are looking at it from one end. It will appear to loop back on itself, sometimes even appearing go back upwards. 'The bright knots in a lightning channel you sometimes see in lightning photographs are the result of the same phenomenon - they are just smaller, tighter 'loops'. It appears brighter because there is more than one section of lightning channel 'overlapping' in the camera's frame.' The Met Office's lightning expert Sven-Erik Enno told MailOnline: 'On the particular photo it seems that the upper part of the channel may be pointed towards the observer. 'In such perspective the upward movement of the horizontal channel may be more amplified - the approaching horizontal channel seems to rise higher in the sky as approaching plane seems to rise higher above the horizon although its real altitude does not change.' The map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013. Areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer (0.4 square miles) - are bright pink. The Democratic Republic of Congo was found to have the most over the period ."}

Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus recalled the years of rapes, torture and psychological games at the hands of Ariel Castro, a man who lived close to their homes in Ohio, and managed to lure them into his house with trust because his daughters were the girls' friends. The brave survivors have written a book, Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland, which will be released on April 27. In an excerpt, published in People magazine this week, Amanda and Gina, revealed how they found the strength to survive imprisonment. Scroll down for video . Amanda Berry, pictured following her escape from Ariel Castro's 'house of horrors' with her sister (left) and daughter (right) in 2013. The survivor has described in her new memoir, how her daughter gave her the strength to go on during the harrowing ten-year ordeal . Amanda Berry, 29, revealed in her first-person memoir about her abduction and imprisonment by Ariel Castro, that she was left confused by conflicted feelings towards him when he was kind to their daughter, whom she gave birth in captivity after being raped . Gina DeJesus, 25, also shared the details of her horrifying ordeal in a new memoir with Amanda Berry, being published later this week . Amanda recalled how she had learned from TV news that her mother died of a heart attack, aged 43, in March 2006, while she was 'chained like a dog' in Castro's home. At this point, the teen had been missing for three years. Castro lured her into his home on April 21, 2003, on a promise to see his daughter, her acquaintance. He barricaded the 16-year-old in a room, told her to pull down her pants and raped her. She was then chained in the basement and repeatedly abused. Four days after she was captured, Castro turned on the news and saw her mother pleading for her safe return. She said that a silent Castro watched Louwana Miller beg for her daughter to come home. 'He has an odd look on his face, and then I realize: He's proud,' Amanda wrote about her monstrous captor. She also described in the People interview how Castro was much stronger than he looked, packing muscle beneath his rotund figure. 'To be around him was scary,' Amanda recalled.'He had these cold black eyes. We were afraid we were going to die.' The Cleveland 'house of horrors' survivors have written a book, being published on April 27 . Gina DeJesus was abducted using a similar ploy by Castro a year later. She described her abductor to People as 'always prepared'. It later emerged that Michelle Knight, now 34, had been imprisoned in a separate bedroom since August 2002. A month after learning that her mother, Louwana Miller, had died, Amanda, realized she was pregnant by Castro in April 2006. Although initially elated, she worried how Castro would react. Amanda wrote: 'I think my mom sent me this baby. It's her way of giving me an angel. But I worry about what he's going to do. 'Michelle told me that he beat her to make her miscarry. Will he let me carry my baby?' As the pregnant teen mourned her mother alone amid harrowing torture and abuse, she recalled how she made video tapes of news reports of her mom at vigils and watched them repeatedly. Amanda wrote in the memoir: 'I would rewind and hear her voice. I feel like she's definitely here with me now.' On Christmas Day, she gave birth in her prison of a home to daughter, Jocelyn, with the help of Michelle. Castro appeared delighted to have a new daughter, Amanda wrote. She recalled: 'When the baby started kicking, I reached for his hand and placed it on my stomach. 'I knew the baby would be safer if he was excited about being a new father.' Castro told her that they were 'a family'. The predator took the little girl, whom he called Pretty, to church and out to play while her mother remained in chains in his filthy, dilapidated home. Castro finally took the chains off the three women when Jocelyn started to notice them, even though Amanda tried to protect her daughter by telling her that they were only bracelets. Amanda described her confusion at feeling some warmth towards Castro when he treated their daughter well. She wrote: 'I know it's wrong but I feel closer to him. I appreciate that he treats Jocelyn so well and buys her clothes and toys. 'I desperately want Jocelyn to have a normal life. On the days that he helps me do that, I actually feel some affection for him. I'm so confused. 'How can he be good one minute and so cruel the next?' When Jocelyn was five years old, Amanda set up a kindergarten in their bedroom. Amanda asked Castro to buy books. She recalled how her daughter would sit at her 'Dora' desk while Amanda, acting as teacher, would recite the Pledge of Allegiance with her. In November 2012, Castro was becoming more agitated. He lost his job as a bus driver due to stress and began to wonder how he would be remembered in the newspapers because of what he had done. His daughter Jocelyn began to ask when she could go to a real school. Amanda Berry (pictured left as a teen) along with Gina DeJesus (right) and Michelle Knight were held captive in Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio home for 10 years . The broken front door of the house on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland Ohio where Amanda Berry kicked her way to freedom on May 6, 2013, more than a decade after she went missing . On May 6, 2013, a chance finally arose - Castro forgot to lock the door of her bedroom, and Amanda grabbed her daughter and bolted for the front door, kicking her way out through a bottom panel. Amanda described that heart-pounding break for freedom in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts for ABC's 20/20 to be aired next Tuesday. She said: 'I didn't know what to do, my heart immediately started pounding because I’m like, ''is-- should I chance it? ... He could be here any minute, if I’m going to do it, I need to do it now.' Following the daring escape, police descended on the home, freeing the other women and arresting Castro. He pleaded guilty in July 2013 to 937 counts including two charges of aggravated murder related to one act of forcing one of his victims to miscarry. The 53-year-old was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years in August 2013. He hanged himself in his prison cell less than a month into his sentence. Neither Gina nor Amanda is still in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight (pictured) but said in an interview that they wished her well for the future . Amanda recalls how mixed she felt when she learned from a text message that he killed himself. But despite being chained and raped for a decade by the monster, Jocelyn was his daughter and the little girl loved him. 'I don't know what to feel,' she wrote of that September night, as tears streamed down her face. Amanda and Gina revealed in their memoir, written with Washington Post journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, how their captor would play mind games and try to turn them against each other. However they began to establish bonds as they struggled through their darkest hours. Neither Amanda or Gina is currently in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight. In People Magazine, Gina said: 'I think we all did like each other at one point but then [Ariel} played us against each other so we couldn't trust people.' Amanda added that the difficulty of their situation was something that only the three women could understand and she wished Michelle the best for the future. The mother said that she was focused on moving forward in life and concentrating on doing the best for her now eight-year-old daughter. Gina, who is studying for her high school diploma, dreams of owning her own business. And both women said what they have been through left them happy, simply for being able to have regular lives, surrounded by their families.

The firm's boss told MailOnline the aim is to offer features that customers want, including 12-month contracts and affordable 4G handsets . When iD launches next month it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries, ahead of Three with 18 countries and Lyca on 17. Carphone Warehouse's iD will use Three's existing infrastructure to offer these networks and plans. 'Carphone Warehouse is unique because we speak to more customers across the networks than anyone else. This gives us a unique customer insight,' UK and Ireland chief executive Graham Stapleton told MailOnline. The iD network (logo pictured) will use Three's existing infrastructure to offer networks and plans . 'They tell us what could be better across the whole of the industry and iD is based on that insight; giving customers what they want. 'We're building this network from scratch and are using the latest technology to connect and build iD, and because tech is moving so quickly we've been able to come up with something innovative and different.' He said that at launch Carphone Warehouse is creating a platform for the network and in 'two to three months' time [it] will launch products that no-one else will have.' But Mr Stapleton wouldn't reveal what these will be in order to maintain a competitor advantage over rival networks. He continued that the aim is to have all the handsets it currently sells available on the network. 'The reason we are putting 12-month contracts and deals out there is that there is no-one else offering such 12 month contracts and our customers said it was a feature they wanted,' he continued. iD won't the only network to offer 12-month contracts, though. Vodafone, for example, has a range of contracts that start at £9.50 a month. When iD launches it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries, shown in the graph above. This will put it ahead of Three with 18 countries and Lyca on 17 . Carphone Warehouse's boss Graham Stapleton said the iD website will launch tomorrow, where people can register their interest. The full range of plans will be announced as they become available, but an example  offers the Samsung A3 (shown) on a 12-month 4G plan with 300 mins, 5000 texts and 1 GB data for £19.50 . In terms of next steps, Mr Stapleton said the website will launch tomorrow where people can register their interest, and the network as a platform will launch in May - although he didn't give an exact date. Two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network, Google is now said to be looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees. The tech giant is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. The firm will also be launching an app to manage billing and then new features will be announced during the summer that Mr Stapleton described as 'just fantastic and very innovative.' The full range of plans and offers will be announced as they become available, but an example plan offers the Samsung A3 on a 12-month 4G plan with 300 mins, 5,000 texts and 1 GB data for £19.50. 'This is just the beginning,' added Mr Stapleton. 'We know that there are lots more customer issues and frustrations with existing mobile plans that we're eager to tackle. 'We want this network to be focused on the individual and we will continue to listen to customers over the coming months, asking them to help develop and evolve iD.' Other features include controls and caps to help people prevent 'Bill Shock' - surprise costs and fees added to their account. iD is the first major initiative from Dixons Carphone and will be available to customers via all Carphone Warehouse, Currys and PC World stores, as well as online. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'It's quite a coup that iD piggybacks off Three's network given that Carphone Warehouse hasn't offered any deals from the network in years. Perhaps iD Mobiles was the olive branch. 'The promise of 12-month contracts is likely to be a major win with mobile users who crave flexibility - we know that because of the rising popularity of SIM-only deals. 'But iD's success all hinges on how keenly these shorter contracts are priced. We eagerly await more concrete details, in terms of cost and the full range of handsets that will be offered.' Carphone Warehouse is the latest firm to launch its own network. In January Sky announced plans to launch its own network, powered by O2. O2's owner Telefónica UK will give  Sky wholesale access to 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data services. The first deals are expected to launch in 2016.

It is also said to be the most popular 'triple-play' provider, with almost 40 per cent of its customers taking its three services - TV, telephone and broadband. Adding a mobile service would make it a so-called 'quad-play provider.' More recently it launched a mobile TV service Sky Go that lets people watch live and on-demand  films and TV shows on their phones and tablets.

As a candidate for president in 2008, Obama promised to use the term to describe the mass murder if elected but has not followed through despite calls from the most famous Armenian-American, Kim Kardashian, and the Pope for the world to recognize the killings as a genocide. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since at least 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. She last week traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins Kara and Kourtni Kardashian. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument’s eternal flame. Scroll down for video . Tricky language: President Barack Obama (pictured Tuesday) will be sending an administration official to Armenia this week, to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But the White House still refuses to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim Kardashian, in red, and Khloe Kardashian, in blue, walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial last week. Kim and Khloe were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Kholoe Kardashian's Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. Top administration officials discussed the decision with Armenian-American leaders Tuesday. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use this week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said yesterday he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kim and Khloe laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert genocide monument’s eternal flame during their visit . Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . The White House said that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' The White House also announced that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew will attend a ceremony in Armenia Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement yesterday. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name last week to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Kim Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it.' 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip last week to her ancestor's homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' She kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Wednesday morning the online petition had more than 175,300 supporters and was less than 25,000 signatures away from it's goal of collecting 200,000 names. 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed."}

In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed Nigel Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines . Mr Cameron issued an appeal to people planning to vote UKIP to instead support the Tories in an attempt to block a 'toxic tie-up' between Laabiur and the SNP. But Mr Clegg condemned the 'worrying' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the 'far right'. Speaking in his bright yellow campaign bus as he headed to the South West, Mr Clegg: . Mr Farage has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, in an apparent attempt to generate headlines and shore up Ukip's core vote. He was condemned in the first TV leaders' debate for saying people with HIV should not be allowed into Britain and in the second for attacking the audience for being too left-wing. After criticism that the Ukip manifesto featured almost all white faces, he insisted yesterday that there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person'. The Lib Dem leader told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' Miriam González Durantezhas been writing a food blog . Nick Clegg is such a bad cook his wife Miriam only lets him do the washing up. The Lib Dem leader admitted his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - MumAndSons - posting recipes and photographs online. Mr Clegg said he had played no part in the culinary operation, but had helped with taking pictures for the blog: 'I'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them.' But his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast. 'I'm a sort of sous chef, Mr Clegg told MailOnline. 'I provide helpful moral backing and assistance. I'll do the washing up, and tasting and preparatory tasks.' Asked if there was nothing he could cook, Mr Clegg replied: 'I'm sure I could but I'm great eater, I'm just really not a very good cook. 'If I had to, if I was starving... Peanut butter on white toast obviously, with jam on top. I'm seriously into jam on top.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez said she had run a cooking blog with her children  for three years . Mr Clegg said the comments revealed Mr Farage's true nature: 'The mask is slipping. I think the more he thrashes around to get attention the more the mask slips and the truly odious nature of his views become more and more obvious. 'This is someone who is clearly uncomfortable talking about people from different ethnic backgrounds, calls them 'half' and 'fully' black, but is also someone who advocates basically turning our backs on people who are very sick and kind of indulging in a language that is so divisive, so odious.' Mr Clegg, who boasts that the Lib Dems will win many, many more seats than UKIP on May 7, accused Mr Farage of 'running a truly incompetent campaign'. 'He is just lashing around, thrashing around, lurching from one odious gaffe or assertion to the next. There is no pattern. 'One moment he claims he wants to take his manifesto seriously and the next he is talking about fully and half black candidates. 'You are either serious or a kind of Victor Meldrew on stilts. Which one are you? 'It just beggars belief that it is that kind of person that the Conservative party thinks they need to bring back into the fold.' He said Mr Cameron's appeal to Ukip voters 'could not have been more explicit - people like Farage, please come back home'. 'I don't think the Conservative should have a home for those kind of views,' he added. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus HQ in Filton, Bristol before travelling to Wales, said he would use the final 15 days of the campaign to tell voters of the 'danger of these kind of really odious views basically taking over or encroaching upon how a mainstream party like the Conservative party thinks and acts'. He warned that without the Lib Dems back in coalition, the Tories would be dragged to the 'extremes' by right wing backbenchers, Ukip and the DUP. He said that it is a 'tragedy' that a centrist politician like Mr Cameron had lost control of his party. 'What's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless Conservative leadership. 'And the Conservative leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from UKip, from DUP, from their own backbenches, which will do huge damage to our country. Huge damage. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus factory in Filton, Bristol today, said the Lib Dems would act as a 'bulwark' against the Tories lurching to the right . Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka' Mr Farage - appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning - has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, sparking accusations from Mr Clegg today that he was an 'odious Victor Meldrew' (pictured right) Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka'. 'They have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times,' Mr Clegg said. 'And they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it.' Mr Clegg went head to head with Mr Farage in two TV debates last year, ahead of the European Parliament elections, which UKip went on to win while the Lib Dems lost all but one seat in Brussels. Mr Clegg insisted most people in Britain are 'decent and pragmatic', and that the Lib Dems are most 'in tune' with public opinion. But he admitted he faces a 'challenge' to turn that into votes after a devastating collapse in popularity since entering coalition five years ago. We're the guarantee that will not let the swivel-eyed brigade take over. He added: 'We are the only bulwark, we are the only barrier, we are the only dam against this increasing pressure from people with some very, very nasty views which would lead to ideologically imposed cuts on nurseries, on schools on colleges.' David Cameron came under fire from Mr Clegg as he visited Advantage children's daycare nursery in Surbiton with London Mayor Boris Johnson . Mr Clegg said he defended Mr Farage's right to say controversial things in an open democracy, but hoped they would be defeated on Election Day. 'I really really abhor what Farage stands for but I don't begrudge the right to say what he says and seek to represent those views in Parliament. 'What worries me much more is not whether he gets a number of MPs in the House of Commons, those seats then become the tail that wags the Tory dog. 'Democracy should be able to encompass views that I would find absolutely beyond the pale, that's what being a free country is about. 'It's about disagreeing with those views, taking them on, arguing against them and defeating them in an argument. 'It's not about saying they shouldn't be expressed. That would be very illiberal.'

If only he'd do it with policy, rather than these venting, personal attacks. A trick he has obviously learned from Mr Cameron.'"}

The Ukip leader said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now. Mr Farage urged Prime Minister David Cameron to resist pressure at an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow for Britain to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the Mediterranean by people-smugglers. Scroll down for video . The Ukip leader, on ITV's Lorraine this morning, said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now . He insisted the UK could not take more than 'a few thousand' genuine refugees. His comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled. Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy, described by UNHCR as 'the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean we have ever recorded'. The Ukip leader's comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled . Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . Europe has been urged to copy Australia's military-led 'stop the boats' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. Australian PM Tony Abbott – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach Australia – said the EU should 'urgently' follow his lead. His hardline policy has proved controversial but Mr Abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on Saturday night. He said: 'The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats. 'That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people-smuggling trade across the Mediterranean.' Conservative Mr Abbott won power in 2013 on a 'stop the boats' pledge, and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months. Operation Sovereign Borders involves the Australian Navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea, and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from. Mr Abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the United Nations over Australia's obligations to refugees, saying his policy was the 'most decent, most compassionate' solution. In the Mediterranean, callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by European nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back. Last year, Italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives. But the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions. EU leaders including David Cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a 'life or death' summit to solve the problem. The death toll from capsizing disasters stands at 1,727 so far this year - 30 times higher than the 56 fatalities by April 21 last year, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). At its recent rate the total for this year could reach 30,000. The Prime Minister and other European leaders are under mounting pressure to come up with a plan to stem the rising number of migrants killed trying to cross the sea for a better life in Europe. Mr Farage said Britain bore a burden of responsibility for the flow of migrants heading out of north Africa because of its military interventions in countries like Libya and Iraq. He said he was happy for Royal Navy ships to take part in search and rescue operations in the area, and for funds currently spent on overseas aid and EU contributions to be diverted to help people in the countries involved. But the Ukip leader told BBC1's Breakfast: 'The big message has to come from Italy, the big message has to come from Greece. The Australian prime minister said it yesterday: unless we send a message that we are not going to unconditionally accept unlimited numbers of people, they will keep coming. That's a decision that's got to be taken by the southern Mediterranean countries. 'What is the message from Italy and Greece? Is it that anybody that comes will be accepted? Because if it is, millions of people could be coming over the next couple of years. 'I'm suggesting that they should be making sure that those people coming in vessels that are not seaworthy should be put into vessels which are seaworthy and taken back to where they came from. 'There may be some cases where people genuinely need refugee status and if Britain has to give a helping hand and give, for example, some Christians refugee status ... then fine.' Asked how many refugees he would be willing for the UK to take, Mr Farage said: 'I would suggest a few thousand, because we as a country can't take unlimited numbers of people. The Prime Minister is going to be under intense pressure on Thursday for us to take really very big numbers and I am afraid we simply can't do that.' Mr Cameron has faced criticism for cutting funding for search and rescue operations in the area. The Times said British military chiefs were preparing to offer one of the country's biggest warships to help tackle the refugee crisis. HMS Bulwark, a 176-metre launchpad for helicopters and small vessels which protected London during the 2012 Olympics, is understood to be among the options being considered by ministers. An MoD spokeswoman said it was 'looking at options but no decisions have been taken'. The charity Save the Children has called on EU leaders to restart search and rescue operations off the coast of Italy within 48 hours, on the scale of the previous, and far larger, Italian-led Mare Nostrum operation. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone . Chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'EU leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet tomorrow. 'With every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations, the risk grows that more people will die as they try to reach Europe. 'We cannot allow 2015 to be the deadliest year in the Mediterranean yet. We must get agreement at Thursday's meeting to scale search and rescue back up to 2014 levels. 'Even one boat that sinks is one too many, but the escalating number of people dying off Italy's shores brings home the urgent need to act.' Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the response to events in the Mediterranean was 'inadequate' and Europe had to 'raise its game'. Two alleged people smugglers, including one believed to have been the captain of the ship which was wrecked at the weekend, have been detained by Italian authorities, according to reports. It has been claimed the boat capsized after accidentally colliding with another ship which came to its aid. Boris Johnson this morning called for more to be done to help the fleeing migrants . British special forces should be sent into Libya to lead Europe-wide action to tackle human traffickers, Boris Johnson has suggested. The mayor of London insisted action was required to 'choke off the problem at source' to stop migrants being put on to unseaworthy vessels to travel across the Mediterranean Sea from north Africa. He said: 'The first thing to do is to stop the people who are trafficking in human lives and I think sending over a warship - or whatever we're going to do - is entirely right. 'Myself, I'd like to see a real commitment to getting to grips with these people and round...' Host Nick Ferrari asked if this involved sending military personnel into Libya, Mr Johnson said: 'You need to do something about it.' Mr Ferrari countered: 'You're saying special forces into Libya.' Mr Johnson replied: 'I'm a long way away from the discussions about this but there are clearly some very highly organised and ruthless people who are sending people to their deaths in the Mediterranean. It seems to me that is something that should be the subject of concerted European response led by Britain.' Mr Ferrari interjected: 'We've got it - the SAS and SBS into Libya.' Mr Johnson said: 'I don't see why not, I don't see why not.'"}

Historians have discovered a 1,900-year-old hangover cure written on an ancient Egyptian papyrus. Written in Greek, one of the medical recipes offers advice for how to tackle a 'drunken headache' - with the leaves of a shrub called Alexandrian chamaedaphne, or sometimes Alexandrian laurel. The text recommends stringing the leaves of the evergreen plant, also called Ruscus racemosus, together and possibly wearing it around the neck. This  papyrus was found in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and contains a medical 'recipe' for treating a hangover . While the text recommends this as a way of relieving headaches brought on by alcohol, it is not known if it had any effect. The treatment was discovered as part of an ongoing effort to translate the Oxyrhynchus papyrus - more than 500,000 documents found in an ancient rubbish tip at the Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus, about 100 miles south of Cairo. Oxyrhynchus lies south west of Cairo and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt. It has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods of Egyptian history and among them are fragments of plays and the Gospel of Thomas. The city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills, including lots of written material as Oxyrhynchus was governed bureaucratically by the Greeks and the Romans. Archaeologists have discovered tax returns, census material, receipts, letters about religion, politics, military action and diaries, giving them a thorough picture of everyday life. In 1896, two young excavators - Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt - from the University of Oxford began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish. While they were concerned with finding works of high literature, they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material. Some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university's Sackler Library; among them the account of match fixing. The hangover treatment was one of 24 new medical texts that are the latest to be translated - the 101st volume of translations to be published. Among the documents, researchers at the University of Oxford and University College London have found 11 copies of known medical texts by Galen and Hippocrates alongside the new medical texts. They also found four documents that appeared to be doctors notes. Dr David Leith, a historian and research fellow at the University of Exeter who translated the medical papyrus, said: 'The remedies appear to cross what we might see as the boundary between magic and medicine - and although some ancient doctors disliked making use of \"magical\" remedies, this was far from always the case.' The recipe for drunken headache - kraipale in Greek - read: 'For drunken headache: wear leaves of Alexandrian chamaedaphne strung together.' Dr Leith said: 'The plant name literally means \"ground laurel/bay\", and its leaves are often compared to bay leaves in ancient botanical literature.' The papyrus were discovered during excavations at Oxyrhynchus in 1890 by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt from Queen's College at the University of University. Around 10 per cent of the papyri have been found to be literary and many are private documents, codes, registers, official correspondence, tax records, bills, leases, horoscopes and inventories. Alexandrian chamaedaphne, sometimes called Dane racemosa (above) was recommended as a cure for hangovers in Egypt 1,900 years ago by stringing the leaves in a garland that was hung around the neck . Dr Margarent Mountford, a papyrologist at the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the papyrus texts, said: 'These texts are hugely important as they give us an insight into daily life at the time. 'Some were copies of ancient Greek medical texts but there were some original medical texts - which look more like magical spells in some ways. 'The hangover cure for example involves handing a laurel around the neck. I have my doubts if this would have worked but perhaps it had more of a placebo effect.' Professor Vivian Nutton, a historian at University College London who was one of those taking part in the translations, described them as 'the largest single collection of medical papyri to be published.' Hundreds of thousands of texts written on papyrus were found at Oxyrhynchus during the excavation (above) The papyrus are owned by the Egypt Exploration Society and kept at the Sackler Library at the University of Oxford. The medical documents all date from the first century AD to the sixth century AD. These images of some of the medical papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus contain descriptions for treating eye conditions, fever and haemorrhoids with surgery . It is thought the hangover cure may have been necessary as many ancient societies drank wine rather than water, which was unsanitised. The newly translated medical texts also include recipes for helping to halt the spread of ulcers, others for treating hemorrhoids, toothache, gangrene and a dozen for treating eye conditions. One recipe describes the need to rub a decapitated ant onto a stye. Another for treating a discharge of mucus from the eyes called rheum, uses a mixture of copper flakes, antimony oxide, white lead, washed lead dross, starch, dried roses, rain water, gum Arabic, poppy juice and a plant called Celtic spikenard. Another gruesome text explains the technique for eye surgery to treat someone whose eyelid had turned inside out. While fragmented, it still makes unpleasant reading. It says: 'the eye... i began... by the temple... the other from the temple... to remove with a small round-bladed knife... the edge of the eyelid from outside... from within until I scooped out.' Dr Leith said many of the recipes could have been written out like prescriptions for people to follow. He said: 'We tried to give a good selection of different types of medical text in the volume. 'For example there are scholarly commentaries on famous medical writings, surgical texts, handbooks for students giving definitions of medical terms, treatises on acute diseases, as well as instructions on preparing perfumed oils - which could be used for medical purposes - and medical recipes. The documents were found at the ancient town of Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt  around 100miles (160km) form Cairo . 'One of the fragments contains a detailed description of the surgical procedure for removing haemorrhoids, though the author emphasises that in operating on the patient one of the haemorrhoids must be left untouched. 'Two others offer in-depth discussions of different kinds of fever and their treatment. 'It’s natural to assume that most of these Oxyrhynchus papyri will have been bought or copied by doctors too for their own use. 'On the other hand, some of the medical recipes may have been copied out by ordinary individuals, so that they could have particular remedies to hand for themselves or their families.' This papyrus is an example of texts discoverd at Oxyrhynchus and features Euclid's Elements of Geometry . Ancient Egyptians would did not have modern hangover cures and used strings of leaves instead, according to new translations of 1,900 year old texts found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. Image above posed by a model . The longest medical papyrus ever found is the Papyrus Ebers (pictured). It contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders . Texts found on the site of Deir el-Medina identify a workman on the crew designated as the 'swnw', or physician. The physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues. This physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus. These texts acted like a reference book for the ancient Egyptian medical practitioner, listing individual treatments for different ailments. The longest of these ever found is called Papyrus Ebers and contains more than 800 treatments covering eye problems to digestive disorders. The source of the papyrus is unknown, but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the Theban necropolis. A suggested treatment for a condition that had symptoms similar to asthma is listed as a mixture of herbs heated on a brick so the sufferer could inhale the fumes. Another treatment, this time for intestinal worms, required the physician to cook the cores of dates and a desert plant called colocynth together in sweet beer. He would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days. While smearing a paste of dates, acacia, and honey to wool and applying it as a pessary would be used as a form of contraception by the worker's wives."}

Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence. North Yorkshire police confirmed the men - all aged in their 50s and from the York area - were arrested this morning. The body of the missing chef, who was 35 when she disappeared in 2009, has still not been found. Officers have now launched a fresh search for evidence which could lead to her whereabouts, which is set to continue over a number of days. Police and forensic officers have been working at three houses not far from where Miss Lawrence lived in the Heworth area of York before she went missing six years ago. It is understood the three men have not been arrested before and they remain in custody. A man, in his 50s and from the York area, was arrested last month on suspicion of her murder. He was later released on bail. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009. She was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at the University of York. Detectives began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of York, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. They have also issued previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near the house. The new arrests, and the arrest in March, are understood to be linked to these lines of inquiry. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, head of North Yorkshire Police's Major Crime Unit and the senior investigating officer in the Claudia Lawrence inquiry, said: 'I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important enquiries. Your co-operation and support is greatly appreciated by the investigation team.'

At another property, forensics officers wearing white protective suits were clearly at work. Each of the houses is under police guard. Martin Dales, friend of Claudia's father, said the new arrests were a positive movement in the investigation but that progress was a series of ups and downs for the family. Speaking outside the chef's house, he said: 'Peter finds it very hard, going up and down. 'You feel like you might be getting somewhere and then you get let down. 'Three arrests is certainly a big movement for the police though. 'That's four people in the space of one month.

A resident living near one of the houses said police arrived at around 7am today. Tommy Ward, 81, said: 'It started off with one police car then a few more came.

Now American 28-year-old Scott Keyes has revealed his savvy secrets so you too can explore the world without falling into the ticket traps. The Think Progress reporter reveals his travel hacks in his eBooks How To Fly For Free and How To Find Cheap Flights, and spoke to MailOnline Travel about his top tips. Scroll down for video . Scott Keyes (above), a 28-year-old writer for Think Progress, is about to travel 20,000miles on 21 flights . Globe-trotter: Along the way he will be stopping by 13 countries in Europe and South and North America . Stock up flyer miles through credit cards . Keyes recommends credit cards are the best way to go if you want to quickly and easily rack up frequent flyer miles, which you can then use to take free flights. He only sign up for cards with high sign-up bonuses and relatively low spending thresholds necessary to get those. For example, a card he just got gave 50,000 bonus points for spending $1,000 in three months. The writer makes a point of putting all everyday spending on credit cards in order to hit these spending thresholds. (Unfortunately, this is mostly true for American travellers; European credit cards and elsewhere tend to offer fairly meagre perks.) As long as you can handle credit responsibly and treat your credit card like a debit card, you can work towards a surprising amount of free travel. My favourite credit card is almost always whichever one offers the best sign-up bonus at the time. So right now, the best three are American Airlines' Citi Platinum card, the United MileagePlus Explorer card, and British Airways Visa Signature card, each of which offers a sign-up bonus of 50,000 miles. (For complicated reasons, I probably like the BA card the best, because if you're flying less than 650 miles, 50,000 miles will get you as many as 11 free flights.) I basically ignore the 'get one mile for every dollar you spend' incentive, since I don't have much money to spend. In order to get as many miles as the sign-up bonus, I would have to spend $50,000! I focus almost exclusively on the sign-up bonus when deciding what card to get next. Keyes uses a number of techniques to travel first class around the world for free, which he has revealed in his two eBooks. Here pictured in Mexico . Fly on the cheapest days of the week . Be flexible with your dates when you want to take a trip of a set number of days. Often times a Friday-Monday flight will be cheaper than a Thursday-Sunday, for instance, even though it's the same number of days. Usually the cheapest days to fly are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Keyes poses while rafting down Sumidero Canyon which is located near the city of Chiapa de Corzo in Mexico . Check the day before and after for cheaper fares . Always search one day before or after just out of curiosity, because sometime red-eye flights can technically leave on the next day. These flights leave late at night, arriving in early morning and inside the US these flights are almost exclusively for travel from the West to the East. 'I once helped my friend George cut the price of a round trip flight to Vegas nearly in half by finding a redeye flight that left just after midnight, making it technically a Monday flight and not a Sunday flight,' Keyes tells MailOnline Travel. Wading into the waters of Hierve el agua in Oaxaca, Mexico, rock formations and the remnants of old geysers . Work backwards with your trip . If you want the cheapest flights, chase the fare, not the destination. In other words, rather than picking a destination and then looking for the cheapest way to get there, start out by looking where there are cheap flights, and then decide among those where you'd like to go. Keyes explains: 'I never had my heart set on going to Milan, but when a $65 flight from NYC-Milan popped up, I jumped on it. 'That's too great a deal to pass up, after all.' The 28-year-old having fun wearing a tortoise shell in the Galapagos Islands on holiday . Search for the whole month for flights . Refer to websites such as Kayak and ITA Matrix which give you an month's overview of flights a prices. Make your itinerary as flexible as possible so you are able to opt for going a few weeks after you intended to get the lower fares. Enjoying the view! The writer recommends flying on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday as these are usually cheaper . Try flying to gateway airports . If you're flying to a different continent and want the cheapest price, you should search for a number of different gateway airports in that region. For example, if you want to fly to Bali, start by searching for flights to Bali, but don't stop there. Also look at the cost of flights to Jakarta, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. If any of those flights is significantly cheaper, you can usually find a cheap budget flight from there to continue on to Bali. Searching leg-by-leg like this can save hundreds on your overall flight cost because flight search engines usually can't combine a long haul flight on one airline with a short flight on a separate budget airline.

Don't buy domestic flights more than one-three months in advance. Fares rarely go on sale further than three months in advance, so you'll miss out on some upcoming deals if you book too early. On the other side, don't wait until the last minute to book. Unlike 20 years ago, standby fares are mostly a thing of the past and fares tend to shoot up in the final days before a flight actually takes place. For popular flight times during the holiday season or for long haul, look six months in advance. Being bumped is not the end of the world . Being delayed or bumped from a flight is a situation many travellers fear. However it could prove to be in your favour with some airports if you ask for money or frequent flyer miles instead of flight vouchers. 'I was once given a $500 voucher and a confirmed seat on the next flight — an hour and a half later,' Keyes wrote in How To Fly For Free. 'In other words, I earned $333/hour. 'Like me, if your goal is to fly for free, you probably don’t make $333/hour. 'Plus, unlike flights you book using miles, you actually earn miles when you pay using a voucher.' Keyes is seen posing in front of the famed Materhorn on a previous trip, which straddles the border of Switzerland and Italy . Take advantage of tweet deck and email alerts . Don't make flight hunting something you only do when looking to plan your trip. Constantly be updated with alerts and tweets promoting the cheapest tickets. Keyes recommends the best newsletter alerts are from Airfarewatchdog and The Flight Deal. You can also sign up to receive emails from the savvy traveller himself for deals he comes across.

The five-star hotel in Porto celebrates all things wine - Port wine, in particular - and has the feel of a place steeped in decades-old tradition, with a prime location, classic design and unblemished attention to detail. But, to my surprise, The Yeatman has been open for just five years - a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar. In those five years it has been hitting all the right notes, developing a reputation as a haven for wine lovers and one of Portugal’s best luxury hotels. The Bacchus suite at The Yeatman boasts a high-vaulted wooden ceiling, copper Jacuzzi, fireplace and a rotating bed . Portugal's first wine hotel is built into a hill, providing sweeping views of Porto and the Douro river from the indoor pool and guest rooms . When guests arrive at The Yeatman they set foot in a stunning lobby with a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine . For guests like myself, who know little about wine but will never allow it to go to waste, it presents an opportunity to learn and develop an appreciation for the picturesque Douro region’s nectar. Even though the hotel is dedicated to wine, it’s not just for enthusiasts. Regardless of their knowledge or palate, guests can take advantage of two other things that The Yeatman specialises in: relaxation and imaginative food. When I arrived on a Friday night I stepped into the immaculate lobby - accentuated with a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine - to the sound of an acoustic guitar drifting from Dick’s Bar, the in-house bar where couples canoodle on couches and bartenders mix Port wine cocktails. With more than 80 wines by the glass it is the only bar in Porto to remain open 24 hours a day. Public spaces inside the five-star hotel, including the lobby and Dick's Bar, offer a breathtaking view of Portugal's second-largest city . The Yeatman is located in Vila Nova de Gaia; it is separated from Porto by the Douro river, which spills into the Atlantic Ocean . The Yeatman's large decanter-shaped infinity pool is heated and surrounded by a terrace with plenty of space to lounge in the sun . From the statue of Bacchus, guests’ attention usually moves to the large glass doors and windows that offer sweeping views of the river and the Luis I Bridge, which links Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Guests are afforded the same luxury when they enter their room and set foot on the private terrace, which has impressive views across the river of Portugal’s second-largest city. The Yeatman, Portugal’s first luxury wine hotel, is built into a hill in Vila Nova de Gaia, with all of its 82 rooms facing the river and almost every one themed after a Portuguese winery. Guest rooms at The Yeatman face the river, and almost all of them are themed after a Portuguese winery (pictured: superior room) Each guest room is decorated in an understated, classic style, with a private terrace where guests can relax outdoors . No visit to Porto in northern Portugal is complete without a sampling of its most famous export - Port wine. Guests at The Yeatman are just a short walk from Taylor’s wine lodges and cellars, where its Port wine ages in thousands of barrels. Owned by Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman, which owns the hotel, the compound offers informative tours and tastings, with visitors learning about the history of the sweet wine and the House of Taylor’s, which is in its fourth century. After the tour guests are offered three Port wines - chip dry (extra dry white), late bottled vintage and 10-year-old tawny - and they can pay extra to sample premium Port wines. My tour included a stop inside one of the cellars, which houses nearly 2,000 barrels containing Port wine as old as 1880 and a giant barrel capable of holding 100,000 litres. Located next door to The Yeatman, Taylor's Port wine cellars offers affordable informational tours and tastings for visitors . My superior room, themed after the Quinta do Passadouro winery, was decorated with its labelled bottles, photos of its vineyard and regional artefacts, plus vintage-like furniture and lime green curtains, giving it a luxurious but laid-back feel. Like the rooms, each floor has a theme. Floor one, where the outdoor pool is located, is decorated with framed maps of Portugal, while other floors focus on local history or Portuguese discoveries. Wine is front and centre at this polished hotel, owned by centuries-old Port wine producer Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman, but one could argue that the real star of the show is the Gastronomic Restaurant. The restaurant at The Yeatman is the only one in Porto to carry a Michelin star, offering exceptional service and creative dishes . Tasting menus include dishes such as crispy suckling pig belly (pictured), and codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree . It is the only restaurant in Porto to carry a Michelin star, and during my visit I was treated to a two-hour culinary masterclass with exceptional service and creative dishes from start to finish. The tasting menu included a langoustine broth with crunchy langoustine and Champagne sauce, roasted codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree, crispy suckling pig belly with cardinal prawn slices and herb sprouts, and a chocolate cafe with toffee and caramel ice cream - all paired with Portuguese wines. Best enjoyed before indulging, guests can spoil themselves at the Caudalie Vinotherapie Spa, which offers a number of treatments that stick with the hotel’s wine theme. Guests can spoil themselves at the Caudalie Vinotherapie Spa, which offers a number of treatments that stick with the wine theme . Spa visits include access to a Roman bath (pictured), sauna and The Yeatman’s indoor panoramic infinity pool . Spectacular views are enjoyed from the spa’s private barrel bath rooms, where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a grape extract . I was treated to the spa’s signature massage - the Caudalie relaxing massage, with grape extract oils - after spending some time in the relaxation room, which offers another impressive vantage point of the hustle and bustle across the river. TAP Portugal (www.flytap.com, 0345 601 0932) flies from London Gatwick to Porto 14 times a week, with return fares starting at £120 including all taxes and surcharges. Porto Airport is just a 20-minute drive from The Yeatman. Spectacular views can also be enjoyed from the spa’s private barrel bath rooms, where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a conditioning grape extract. The spa has two levels connected by a spiral staircase set within a giant port wine barrel, and guests also have access to a Roman bath, sauna and The Yeatman’s indoor panoramic infinity pool. From the spa to the restaurant and everywhere in between, everything at The Yeatman comes back to wine, with the hotel acting as an ambassador. One of the features that should delight anyone with an appreciation for it is a ‘working cellar’ on the lower level . Open two hours every day, guests can head down with a sommelier to pick out a wine - from Portugal or another wine-producing nation - to pair with their dinner. After my two-night stay at The Yeatman I still consider myself a novice when it comes to the finer points of wine, but I left feeling confident that there will be fewer surprises the next time I pick up a bottle at the supermarket.

His reputation remains tainted in the mind of many baseball fans. A federal court of appeals threw out the career home run leader's obstruction of justice conviction on Wednesday, ruling 10-1 that his meandering answer before a grand jury in 2003 was not material to the government's investigation into illegal steroids distribution. 'Today's news is something that I have long hoped for,' Bonds said in a statement. Overturned: In this April 13, 2011, file photo, former baseball player Barry Bonds leaves federal court in San Francisco, after being found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice . On April 22, 2015, reversed the sole conviction against baseball slugger Barry Bonds, pictured in 2011, and said he could not be tried again on an obstruction of justice charge that resulted from a steroids probe . 'I am humbled and truly thankful for the outcome as well as the opportunity our judicial system affords to all individuals to seek justice.' Now 50, Bonds said 'I am excited about what the future holds for me as I embark on the next chapter.' Bonds broke Hank Aaron's long-standing career record of 755 homers in 2007, finished that season with 762 and was indicted that December for his testimony before a grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, when he answered a question about injections by saying he was 'a celebrity child.' He was convicted of the obstruction charge in 2011, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the conviction in 2013. But the larger group, which listened to arguments from prosecutors and Bonds' lawyers last September, concluded there was insufficient evidence his initial evasive answer was material to the grand jury's probe. 'The most one can say about this statement is that it was non-responsive and thereby impeded the investigation to a small degree by wasting the grand jury's time and trying the prosecutors' patience,' Judge Alex Kozinski wrote. baseball player: Pittsburgh Pirates Barry Bonds sits in the dugout at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium before his first major league start against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Pittsburgh, May 30, 1986 . 'Real-life witness examinations, unlike those in movies and on television, invariably are littered with non-responsive and irrelevant answers.' Jessica Wolfram, one of the jurors who convicted Bonds following the three-week trial and four days of deliberations, said she couldn't help but feel the decade-long prosecution was 'all a waste, all for nothing.' 'Just a waste of money, having the whole trial and jury,' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. In testifying before the grand jury, Bonds claimed he didn't realize substances he used were illegal performance-enhancing drugs. The appellate judges based their decision on legal issues involving witness testimony, not the underlying facts. Despite holding the career and season home run marks - he hit a single-year record 73 in 2001 - Bonds has been denied entry into baseball's Hall of Fame by baseball writers. He appeared on 36.8 percent of ballots this year, less than half the 75 percent needed. 'I think sadly his reputation has been tarnished, not because of the indictment or the reversal, but because of all the PED use,' former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said. 'I think the public has made up its mind.' Barry Bonds, pictured in 2011, was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement and two years probation after a jury found Barry Bonds guilty on one count of obstruction of justice . Roger Clemens, whose pitching feats were as accomplished as Bonds' batting achievements, also has been denied Hall entry. Clemens was acquitted in 2012 of criminal charges he lied to Congress when he denied using PEDs. Travis Tygart, chief executive officer of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, called the decision \"almost meaningless for the real issue, which is whether he used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat the fans of baseball.\" 'I think at the end of the day America knows the truth and who the real home run record holder is, who did it the right way, and it's obviously not Barry Bonds,' he said. Following the trial that opened in March 2011, a jury deadlocked on three counts charging Bonds with making false statements when he denied receiving steroids and human growth hormone from personal trainer Greg Anderson and denied receiving injections from Anderson or his associates. Bonds was convicted for his response when he was asked whether Anderson ever gave him 'anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with.' 'That's what keeps our friendship,' Bonds said. 'I was a celebrity child, not just in baseball by my own instincts. I became a celebrity child with a famous father. I just don't get into other people's business because of my father's situation, you see.' Thumbs up: In this Sept. 6, 2014, file photo, career home run leader Barry Bonds gives a thumbs up while standing behind the batting cage and watching the Houston Astros take batting practice . Judges divided on their rationale, issuing four separate opinions to reverse the conviction and one to uphold it. The appeals court barred a retrial, citing a prohibition on double jeopardy. Kozinski, writing for himself and four other judges, was concerned the obstruction statute, 'stretched to its limits ... poses a significant hazard for everyone involved in our system of justice, because so much of what the adversary process calls for could be construed as obstruction.' Wolfram remembered there being some confusion among the jurors over the fact that Bonds did answer the question later in his grand jury testimony. Bonds did not testify at the trial. Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson, the only member of the court to back prosecutors, wrote an opinion filled with baseball references that began 'there is no joy in this dissenting judge,' added the judges who sided with Bonds 'have struck out' and concluded 'I cry foul.' The government could ask the 11-judge panel to reconsider Wednesday's decision or could request that all 29 judges on the 9th Circuit rehear the case - which has never happened since the court began using the \"limited en banc\" panels in 1980. Prosecutors also could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision. 'I could not be more happy that Barry Bonds finally gets to move on with his life,' BALCO founder Victor Conte said. No crime: Former Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds greets a fan as he leaves federal court following a sentencing hearing on December 16, 2011 in San Francisco, California . 'Let's hope the prosecutors choose not to waste any more resources on what has been nothing more than a frivolous trophy-hunt and a complete waste of taxpayer dollars.' A seven-time NL MVP and the son of three-time All-Star Bobby Bonds, Barry Bonds earned $192.8 million from the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants during a professional career from 1985-07 and could afford a legal team that outnumbered the government's 13-5 in the court room. He was sentenced in 2011 by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston to 30 days of home confinement, two years of probation, 250 hours of community service in youth-related activities and a $4,000 fine. He already has served the home confinement. Illston declared a mistrial on the three other counts, and the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco dismissed those charges in August 2011. The U.S. attorney's office declined comment on the decision. 'I think the 10-1 vote indicates that it was a farce,' said Bonds' appellate lawyer, Dennis Riordan. 'The greatest impact is the damage it undid. We had a panel opinion that said if you're asked a question on page 78 and you digress before you answer it directly on page 81, you're a federal felon.' In 2009 and `10, the 9th Circuit ruled federal agents illegally seized urine samples and testing records of major league players, with Kozinski saying it 'was an obvious case of deliberate overreaching by the government.' The 9th Circuit three-judge panel ruled in 2010 the government could not present positive urine samples at Bonds' trial because Anderson refused to testify and there was no witness to authenticate the evidence."}

As people lay candles by the sea in Valetta, Malta, an equally emotional memorial service was taking place in front of Rome's Verano Cemetery. The deadliest migrant tragedy on the Mediterranean so far took this year's death toll on the waters to a staggering 1,800. It came as three other people - including a tiny child - died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes. And the relentless tide of migrants escaping the war-torn country of Libya has continued since the tragic wreck this weekend. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece. But an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels today will announce that only 5,000 refugees who survive the perilous journey will be granted safe haven in Europe and the rest will be sent back, the Guardian has reported. Vigil: Mourners in Malta (pictured) and Italy have held candle-lit vigils for the 900 people who died when a migrant ship capsized off Libya's coast this weekend . Mourning: Hundreds of emotional people lay candles by the sea in Valetta, Malta (pictured) to remember the victims of the tragedy .

Sombre: People lay candles as they pause by the sea during a candle light vigil in Sliema, in the outskirts of Valletta, Malta (pictured) Refugees: The endless tide of migrants fleeing war and persecution in Africa has continued since the tragedy, with the Italian coast guard rescuing dozens more off the coast of Sicily yesterday (pictured) Escape: Infra-red images showed the few people who were rescued off Libya's coast on Sunday, while over 900 tragically died . Remembrance: The memorial service in Malta's capital Valetta (pictured) honoured the 24 bodies recovered from Sunday's disaster . Solidarity: An equally emotional memorial service was taking place in front of Rome's Verano Cemetery (pictured) Moving: Catholic association activists prayed with candles in Rome (pictured) to remember the victims of this weekend's disaster . Italy's coast guard rescued another 220 migrants from two large rubber boats around 40 miles from the Libyan coast yesterday. Another 545 - many of whom were not even wearing shoes - were taken to the port of Salerno just south of Naples. A further 446 migrants of Egyptian, Syrian, Sudanese, Somalian and Eritrean origin arrived in Sicily after being rescued from a rickety fishing vessel. The memorial service in Malta's capital Valetta honoured the 24 bodies recovered from Sunday's disaster when the smugglers' boat capsized near Libya with hundreds trapped inside. Only 28 people were rescued and the bodies of most of the desperate migrants were never recovered. Two survivors were arrested as they stepped onto Sicilian soil - 24 hours after their boat capsized -killing around 900 people in one of the worst maritime tragedies in recent history. One was the boat's Tunisian captain was charged with multiple manslaughter and the other his Syrian crew member. Both were questioned on the long journey from Libya to Sicily last night before being taken into custody and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration'. EU leaders will decide how to deal with the migrant crisis during an emergency summit in Brussels today. But a 'confidential draft summit statement' seen by the Guardian reveals that only 5,000 resettlement places across Europe will be offered to refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa. The rest will be sent back as 'irregular migrants' under a new rapid return programme coordinated by the EU's border agency Frontex. It also revealed that there would be no expansion to search and rescue operations around the Libyan coast despite widespread and aggressive pressure for better provisions. Exodus: Another boatload of migrants - crowded on an inflatable dinghy off the Libyan coast (pictured) - were rescued today . Tide: The refugees were among 220 migrants from two large rubber boats picked up around 40 miles from the Libyan coast today . Crammed: Over 500 people - some of whom were not wearing shoes - were taken to the port of Salerno (pictured) Found: The migrants fleeing war and persecution from their respective African nations crammed onto the Italian Navy vessel Chimera . Tragic: Flowers blanketed a room in Valetta's Mater Dei Hospital morgue in Malta, as other mourners gathered on the beach (pictured) Tribute: As some emotional mourners in Malta broke into tears (pictured), a touching note attached to one bouquet read: 'R.I.P. brothers and sisters. You matter' 'You matter': People placed candles on the shoreline rocks in Malta (pictured) as they take part in a vigil to commemorate migrants who died at sea . Innocence: Children too young to understand the true sadness in the situation participated in the ceremony in Malta . Sorrow: Meanwhile a visibly emotional Navy Lieutenant admitted 'we didn't arrive quite in time to save the migrants' Memorial: Catholic association activists pray with candle lights in front of Verano Cemetery i n downtown Rome (pictured) Policy: As mourners in Rome pray (pictured), their Prime Minister has called on EU countries to contribute funds to resettle migrants who make it to Europe . Meanwhile, flowers blanket a room in Valetta's Mater Dei Hospital morgue and a touching note attached to one bouquet read: 'R.I.P. brothers and sisters. You matter.' A visibly emotional Navy Lieutenant said: 'We proceeded out at sea with the hope of course to save as many people as we could but unfortunately we didn't arrive quite in time to save the migrants. Mark Merceica added: 'We were really disappointed and you could feel this through the entire crew, we were really hoping to arrive in time.' An Italian search and rescue mission that saved the lives of over 100,000 migrants in the Mediterranean last year was shut down because EU nations refused to pay for it. It was replaced with a smaller EU scheme which focused on patrolling the coast line after some countries argued that saving migrants would encourage more to make the perilous journey. Many European politicians have acknowledged this week that last year's decision not to replace the Italian search and rescue operation was a mistake. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, which has borne the brunt of caring for the migrants, wants other EU countries to do more to fund efforts to rescue and settle those who make it across. Many EU countries still believe search and rescue operations alone will not solve the problem and more must be done to fight traffickers. Wreck: Local men on the Greek island of Rhodes waded into the surf to save migrants on a rickety wooden boat filled with migrants that had run aground . Death: Three people died in the tragedy, among them a tiny boy (pictured) whose body was seen being carried to land on a white paddle boat . Coward: Later survivors (pictured) told Sky News their captain had simply 'run away' when he lost control of the boat . The smugglers have taken advantage of lawlessness in Libya to set up operations that exported 170,000 migrants across the sea last year. One of the proposals leaders will discuss in Brussels is a military mission to capture and destroy traffickers' boats. Italy's Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti has said: 'We know where the boats are, where the smugglers gather together the people who are fleeing.' And EU officials have drawn comparisons with operations to crack down on Somali pirates, with one senior member saying: 'We are determined to destroy their business model. The leaders will also discuss a pilot project to resettle 5,000 to 10,000 refugees from Mediterranean countries to other EU states. The United Nations estimates 36,000 have made the voyage so far this year. An unprecedented 10,000 refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa have been rescued by Italian ships in the past week. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece."}

For many youngsters, the thought of a single desk with nothing more than a white paper on it and a ticking clock nearby fills them with dread. At best, students get jittery, at worst, their actual grade can be affected. A new survey by academics at Lancashire's Edge Hill University and the University of South Australia has charted a direct link between anxiety and performance, saying pupils who worry about their exam performance are more likely to do badly than those who are less anxious. Countdown to the exam season: A new study by Lancashire's Edge Hill University found a direct link between anxiety ahead of taking exams and grades achieved . The study, which has been published in the British Journal of Educational Psychology, questioned  705 pupils from 11 schools. Researcher Dr Dave Putwain, Reader in Education at Edge Hill University, said: 'There is no doubt that a high degree of worry over one’s performance, or the consequences of one´s performance, has a detrimental effect on GCSE results.' He continued: 'Our study, which was controlled for prior attainment and also how good students were at dealing with exam pressure, found that increased worry still predicted lower achievement.' With that in mind, how can you best ensure your offspring rides the exam storm and comes out the other end feeling happy and achieving what they'd hoped for? FEMAIL has enlisted the help of Michael Ribton, principal at Burlington Danes Academy in West London, which achieved an outstanding grade at its last OFSTED inspection, to offer some sage advice to parents and students on how to get through the tricky months ahead. If Ribton is more than used to getting teenagers to apply themselves in his day job, he's also used to it at home. This summer, his son Joe, 18, will sit A levels, while his daughter Maddy, 16, will take her GCSES. He says: 'Our May half-term holiday has been cancelled so that they are free to get on with revision. 'Their bedrooms are adorned with flashcards and files; their revision timetables and exam timetables are on display in the kitchen. It’s a busy time!' Principal at Burlington Danes Academy Michael Ribton, pictured above (left) helping a pupil to revise, says parents should pin their offspring's revision timetable on the fridge and really engage with them during the lead up to the stressful exam period . Here, he offers his essential guide to how to ease the passage of students bound for the exam hall: . DEVISE A BESPOKE REVISION PLAN THAT INCLUDES REWARDS OF TIME OFF . 'Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it. 'Set yourself goals and reward yourself with time off. A common error is forgetting to add up your cumulative hours on each subject so that you are not overly focusing on one subject. 'Parents need to be part of this as well. A revision timetable should be on the fridge at home! 'Students also need to find the way that suits them best, though there are some foundation blocks to any revision programme that are essential. 'And know what to revise: exam websites are really useful, but do make sure you know the precise course and paper reference codes.' Parents should engage with their children at exam time: Test them on anything they need to learn by rote and make sure they get a healthy breakfast and plenty of weekend exercise . FIND A QUIET PLACE, SWITCH OFF THE INTERNET AND DO PRACTICE QUESTIONS . 'Students need a place to revise, free from distractions and that includes the internet. Though it contains lots of great support material, it can be quite a distraction. 'Revision is not simply re-reading exercise books! It ought to be complemented by undertaking practice questions; challenging oneself is an essential core component of revision too.' Burlington Danes Academy student Fatima Sharif, achieved 4As and 1B grade at AS Level last summer. The student, from White City in West London, currently has conditional offers from five of the country's top universities including Oxford to study English Literature. Although Fatima doesn't have a definite career plan, she is interested in teaching. Here, she explains how she's currently dealing with revising for her A Level exams: . Fatima Sharif is due to sit five A Levels this summer and has a conditional offer from Oxford . 'In order to motivate myself to revise, I think about what I really want to achieve; being really successful, or getting into a great university, and those thoughts really keeps me going. 'I set myself a goal, and my continual motivation is achieving that goal, because I know that it will all be worth it if I just put effort into it now. 'Personally, I don’t really benefit from timetables as I fear that if I am not strictly adhering to them, I am somehow not effectively revising. 'But I definitely recognise that timetables can be incredibly helpful for students as they give them a set time to work and rest, and they break down the huge amounts of work they have into effective revision time. I would definitely recommend a revision timetable to students.' 'Although my family hasn't offered me treats if I do well, I have promised myself them! During my AS exams I really wanted a Kindle, so I told myself that as soon as I got through the tough exams I’d treat myself to one. 'I think revision has more significance if you promise yourself something. It doesn’t have to be big, just something small to direct you on the right course. FATIMA'S TOP THREE TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL REVISION . USE REVISION AIDS INCLUDING FLASHCARDS, POST-IT NOTES AND HIGHLIGHTERS . 'Ensure your child has the tools they need to revise and keep in close contact with the school to find out what they advise you can do to help your child. 'At Ark Burlington Danes, we hand out revision booklets (that contain the basic knowledge for all subjects), flashcards, highlighters and post-it notes. 'We also send text messages, hold intervention classes, cram timetables and do mock exams and questions.' DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY NEW TECHNIQUES . ‘\"Spaced Learning\" has worked well for us: it’s a ‘cramming’ technique based on neuro-scientific research, which enables the memory process to take place very quickly – quickly enough to cover and retain a whole subject module’s content in approximately an hour. 'A Spaced Learning session consists of three identical ‘inputs’ on PowerPoint slides divided by 10-minute breaks filled with ‘brain gym’ activities. 'Watching a whole year group learn, say, about theories on the existence of God and then stand up to write their names in the air backwards with their non writing hand is hilarious!' Don't despair! A positive attitude is essential for both parents and students . FOR STUDENTS . Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it . Revise in a quiet place, free from distractions (switch off the internet if you need to) Use practice questions to hone technique . Buy flashcards, post-it notes and highlighters! Try cram techniques such as 'Spaced Learning' which can train the brain into retaining information . FOR PARENTS . Get involved! Put your child's revision timetable on the fridge at home . Don't bribe your child: the best prize they can have is education . Ask your offspring to explain their work to you; it'll help them to understand it more fully . Offer to test them on the things that they need to learn by rote . Ensure they breakfast well and exercise together on the weekends . Be positive! HOW CAN PARENTS HELP WITH REVISION? 'Parents play a crucial part. 'Firstly, take a close interest in your child's learning, preferably always but especially at exam time. 'Ask your child to explain difficult concepts as teaching someone else is the best way to learn yourself. Test them on anything they need to learn by rote. 'Be positive: high expectations matter and you cannot get away from the fact that exams are a stressful time. 'All a parent can do is to help their child have the very best chance of success and provide every opportunity for their child to give it their best shot.' MAKE SURE THEY EAT WELL AND EXERCISE . 'Feed your child properly throughout the exam season; a good breakfast helps and ensure they get a proper night's sleep too. 'At ArkBDA we provide a healthy breakfast for all pupils and we've found that it really boosts levels of engagement. 'Know when their exams are, set your alarm clock and get up with them to help them get organised. 'At weekends, get some exercise together.' SHOULD YOU PAY FOR EXTRA TUITION? It ought not be necessary in good or better schools, but a tutor can help boost the confidence of a child. I would hope the parents at my school would talk with me first before investing money to support their child. An outstanding school would see this as a failure on their part. BRIBES AREN'T THE ANSWER! A good education is a reward in itself, it opens so many doors. Bribes aren't necessary."}

Culpable: There were 3,700 women who served in the Nazi death camps during the Second World War - but only three have been investigated by prosecutors in Germany for their roles as accomplices to mass murder . And, in a crushing blow to the millions of Jews murdered at Nazi death camps across Europe, they are all deemed too ill or infirm to ever be punished. Those 'merciless' women who traded femininity, motherhood and marriage to wed themselves to the dark side of Hitler's Third Reich include Charlotte S. A guard at the notoriously brutal women’s concentration camp of Ravensbrueck, in northern Germany, she was remembered by survivors as a feared woman who beat prisoners and unleashed on them her Alsatian dog. A fanatical Nazi, the dog handler patrolled the camp with her Alsatian she had trained to bite at the inmates' genitals. She was transferred to Auschwitz where she and her teeth-baring dog were feared by the prisoners kept as slaves and worked in the sweatshop factories around the camp. One female prisoner after the war testified: 'There was a woman there with a kindly smile that masked a hideous nature. She was ramrod straight and had a snarling dog that was indoctrinated to hate the prisoners. 'We would be forced to stand stock still for hours and if anyone moved in the cold or the heat, the dog was unleashed. Many people did not survive the maulings.' Brutal: The women patrolling the death camps were just as bad as their male counterparts. Pictured: Female overseers  at Bergen-Belsen, having been taken prisoner by the British in April 1945 . Tortured: Prisoners look out from behind a barbed wire enclosure at the Dachau concentration camp - where 41,500 died - in Germany in 1945. They and their relatives look likely to never get the justice they deserve . Survivors: French prisoners pictured when the Nazi concentration camp of Dachau, near Munich, was liberated by Allied troops at the end of April 1945. Many of the Nazi guards got away with their crimes by claiming they were just following orders . She began an affair with an SS man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant. After the war, in Saxony-Anhalt, which was behind the iron curtain, the communist authorities tried her for her wartime role and she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for 'mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge'. Now 94, she still lives in the state and refuses to speak about her terrible past. Nevertheless, unlike 93-year-old Groening, a former SS sergeant being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder, Charlotte S has been told there is no case for her to answer. Another to get off scot free is Gisela S, a 'hard-faced' woman who worked in the feared SS under her maiden name of Demming. She was a harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners as punishment for petty rule infractions. Gisela was also in charge of the standing cells - small, dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed into. It was not uncommon for her to leave prisoners in these rooms for days on end, causing the death of some or all of those confined. Demming formed a romantic relationship with SS Dr Franz Bernhard Lucas but she abruptly ended it when he criticised the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious 'Angel of Death' Dr Josef Mengele on inmates. She was a true believer in the Nazi racial policies that decreed Jews, gypsies and Slavs were 'lesser races' who deserved nothing else. She appeared at the Auschwitz Trial of former guards and overseers in Frankfurt in the 1960s - but escaped jail. And now prosecutors say she is also too old and frail to be tried in court. Court: SS Sergeant Oskar Groening, known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz', pictured during the war and today. He is charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the camp . Groening, pictured, told the court that he is 'morally responsible' for the mass slaughter even though he did not participate personally in any violence . Trial: People like Auschwitz survivor Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, left, from Budapest and her 23-years-old granddaughter Luca Hartai, have traveled from all over the world to witness one of the few prosecutions held . Possibly most frightening of all is Gertrud Elli Senff, who revelled in the power she yielded to play 'God' in choosing who should live and who should be sent to the Auschwitz gas chambers. Now 92, she was formerly an SS guard at Majdanek in Lublin, Poland, where an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during WW2. Prosecutors have traced her SS identity card. The card, bearing the number 312, has been authenticated, which proves she was there. It carries the inscription: 'The holder is authorised to bear arms' - meaning she was a pay-grade above ordinary guards usually only sanctioned to carrying a 'schlagstock' - a 'beating stick.' After service in Majdanek she was sent to Auschwitz, where she was based at Birkenau - the gas chambers complex where 1.1million prisoners were exterminated. Before the camp fell to the Russians she was shipped back to Germany and escaped justice at the end of the war. But officials at the Ludwigsburg authority have, it is understood, testimony from several now deceased prisoners that she was a 'cruel' and 'merciless' guard who beat them with leather whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp where daily 'selections' were made about who should live - and who was to be gassed. Now wheelchair bound, she was tracked down by the German daily newspaper, Bild. Her daughter said: ‘We know that my mother had something to do with Auschwitz. We have tried to talk with her about it but her memory doesn’t really function any more.’ A recent drive to find the last of the guards before they die of old age has seen posters put up around the country, and 30 arrests made in February of last year. And prosecutors have still to decide on his case and a handful of others, but few are convinced that justice will be done. To many, particularly Jews persecuted ruthlessly by the Nazis, this is all a case of 'too little, too late'. According to historian Andreas Eichmüller, of the 6,500 members of the SS who served in Auschwitz and survived the war, only 29 were convicted in West Germany and reunified Germany, while about 20 were convicted in East Germany. Efforts were no doubt hampered originally by the judiciary, police and civil service which were, in the post-war years, full of former Nazis. Vicious: Another was accused of making as many as 15 people stand for days on end in a tiny cell, a punishment which left people dead - but she will never be brought before the court to answer to the law . Getting away with it: Of the 6,500 members of the SS who served in Auschwitz and survived the war, only 29 were convicted in West Germany and reunified Germany, while about 20 were convicted in East Germany . 'Unfortunately, very few people who committed the crimes had to pay for them,' said Efraim Zuroff, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's top Nazi hunter. He added: 'The passage of time in no way diminishes the crimes.... It's only a shame that this kind of legal reasoning was not applied previously, because it would have led to many, many more cases of people who definitely deserved to be brought to justice.' Kurt Schrimm, the head of Germany’s special prosecutor’s office, which is responsible for investigating Nazi era war crimes, who has worked to locate the remaining SS criminals and bringing them to justice 1986. 'We owe it to the victims and to their families,\" he said. \"I want to do my job well for as long as it takes. The dead and the families of the dead deserve nothing less than to see justice done.'"}
