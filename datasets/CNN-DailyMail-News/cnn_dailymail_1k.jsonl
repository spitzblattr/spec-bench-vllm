{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 986, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland."}

But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal."}

President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to \"contain himself.\" And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president \"could do better.\" Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. \"It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"That's a very bad deal. \" Netanyahu said Iran is a country of \"congenital cheating\" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. \"I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful,\" Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu \"would contain himself.\" The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are \"on the cusp of something that can be workable.\" \"It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes,\" Feinstein said. \"But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world.\" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the \"breakout\" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the \"almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal.\" \"We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb,\" he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on \"Face the Nation\" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a \"new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama.\" And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. \"Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better,\" Graham said."}

What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. \"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,\" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: \"Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.\" \"Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza\" tweeted Aღanda. \"Just mock them for their ignorance.\" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. \"Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!\" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  \"Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.\" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. \"Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?\" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads \"bigots.\" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. \"Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?\" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. \"Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,\" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. \"What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,\" tweeted Savannah. \"Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere.\" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is \"to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,\" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. \"That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,\" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. \"You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be.\" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks. Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony. A former banker, 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting, was charged with two counts of murder. On Thursday, a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May. Here's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker. Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene, an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai, an inner-city suburb that's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars, residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods. In the early hours of Saturday morning, November 1, police say Jutting called them to the apartment.  There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor, later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. During a search of the apartment, officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony. It's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap, in Central Java, and was the mother of a five-year-old girl. In a statement, her cousin, Jumiati, described her as  \"just an ordinary woman from Indonesia\" who, like many others, was \"forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes (sic) true.\" \"She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family,\" Jumiati wrote. \"She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment.\" According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body, Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found. Last year, her grieving father, Ahmad Khaliman, told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013. She'd since returned on two occasions, Khaliman said. He said the family had been shocked by her murder, and called for the perpetrator to be executed. \"If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life,\" he told CNN affiliate Trans7. Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa, according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body. Also known as Jesse Lorena, Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province, in southeast Indonesia. Other than that, few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong. After news of their death spread, fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong's Victoria Park. Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray, and lay flowers besides photos of the two women. The victims' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November. Before being taken into custody, Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai.  He was detained at the scene, where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises. It's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past. Jutting's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same unit in London for three years. According to the profile, Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge, between 2004 and 2008. As part of the trial process, tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea. He was. The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed."}

The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for \"partnership certificates\" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. \"It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing,\" Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. \"What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society,\"  Matsunaka said . \"It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing.\" Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, told CNN the ordinance was a \"big first step for the protection of human rights.\" He called the decision \"happy\" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it \"should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding (LGBT individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young.\" Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya's lead. However, former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement's momentum for granted. \"To realize equal rights for gay couples, a national law has to be made,\" he said. While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan, its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage. Many hide their sexuality from their employers, co-workers, families and friends. But the tide may be turning. A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4% oppose gay marriage, but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70%. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which commissioned the poll, welcomed the Shibuya decision, calling it \"a bold and important step forward.\" Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan's constitution, but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation, according to Mari Miura, a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. \"The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage, so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional,\" Miura told Bloomberg Business. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party \"don't like the idea of same-sex marriage, but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum.\" Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition, with one, known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education, telling the Japan Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the \"familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history.\" While Shibuya's registration system will be a first for Japan, Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community. In 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced, and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to LGBT individuals.

Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility \"out of an abundance of caution\" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. \"Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,\" the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters.

{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 986, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Residents of central Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods: Detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors. And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. Under the rain of coalition bombs, the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country, still control Sanaa. But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. Yemen's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes. He fired his former Army chief of staff, Hussein Khairan, on Sunday. The firing had no practical effect, since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels' acting defense minister. Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia, which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him. Fighting has ended dozens of lives each day. On Monday, more than 50 people died in the port city of Aden alone, where Houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to Hadi on the ground, Agence France-Press reported. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. \"Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,\" said Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East. \"Medical supplies need to be here yesterday,\" said ICRC spokeswoman Marie-Claire Feghali from Sanaa. \"We need to save the lives that can be saved.\" Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies, the other with workers. But flying in will be hard, since most airlines have canceled their flights, and airstrikes have taken out many airfields. On Monday, the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in Djibouti, Feghali said. The ICRC is hoping to fly out in a day or two. Following the ICRC's call, on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia's behest. Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing key elements. It didn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to intervene with force. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border. Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail. Hadi's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP, but with the Houthi takeover, that arrangement has evaporated, and the terror group operates generally unchecked."}

Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan. But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist. \"After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners, the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject, Zulkifli Abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists,\" David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told CNN in a statement. The FBI had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf. Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono, in the southern province of Maguindanao. The mission went disastrously awry. Forty-four members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit were killed in the assault, targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government. According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last month, the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS. In the immediate aftermath of the assault, the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire, before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a \"blocking force\" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with MILF fighters. According to the IPAC report, the SAF \"blocking\" company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived, . Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died. The clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the MILF, authorities said. A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest. Bowdich expressed the FBI's \"sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive.\" While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines. The IPAC report argued that the \"single-minded focus\" of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF, which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress. \"The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy,\" read the report, which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not \"the master bomber that his reputation suggested.\" Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies, killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations, for fear of word leaking to their target. The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan's who described the Malaysian as \"a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon.\" READ MORE: Dozens of Philippine police killed in raid on 'high value' bomb makers .

Zhou Yongkang, 72, was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the highest prosecution authority in China, said. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of \"preserving social stability.\" Now, prosecutors have accused Zhou of \"taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money\" during his long political career. His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests, they added. Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer's views were heard, according to a statement by the prosecutors. His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing. The president of China's supreme court recently told reporters there would be \"open\" trials for accused former leaders like Zhou. However, the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou's case. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth, in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign,  targeting both \"tigers\" and \"flies\" --  high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi's dragnet to date. \"The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,\" longtime political analyst Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said last year, when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou. Many observers also note Zhou's patronage of Bo Xilai, a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013. Bo's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. The former Chongqing Communist Party chief's supporters, however, have long called him a political victim --  the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political watchers see similarities between the Bo and Zhou cases. \"The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles,\" said Lam, who has predicted a suspended death sentence for Zhou."}

Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul."}

And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. \"For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick,\" Stewart said.  \"You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens.\" A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is \"extremely rare.\"  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired \"third-party specialists\" to help in the hunt for Felix. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search,\" Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. \"We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\" Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. \"You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage,\" Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. \"We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will,\" she said."}

She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes. Farther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing. It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns. Rochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said. On Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media. Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A  large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  \"It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants,\" said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out. \"We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them.\" People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured,  Widick said. Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour. People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said. In Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of Olson's friends' homes. A safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before. He'd have a job ahead of him. \"I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, \"but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe,\" she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable. The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said. Only foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. \"You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be,\" he said. Lindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area. VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. \"I've got the clothes on my back,\" he said. But his family wasn't at home when it hit. \"My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived.\" It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. \"I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado.\" He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes. The service warned of a \"particularly dangerous situation.\" People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday.

The Indiana woman's story became known around the world last year when she was able to realize her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up the opening game of its schedule to accommodate her desire to play. Hill died early Friday. At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost \"an unselfish angel.\" \"It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,\" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. \"But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many.\" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill: . \"I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others.\" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. The organization called her a \"worldwide inspiration.\" \"Lauren captured the hearts of people worldwide with her tenacity and determination to play in her first collegiate basketball game with her Mount St. Joseph University team,\" the group said on Facebook. People we've lost in 2015 . Mount St. Joseph University President Tony Artez said Hill's \"love and laughter will remain in our hearts.\" \"We are forever grateful to have had Lauren grace our campus with her smile and determined spirit,\" Artez said in a statement. \"She has left a powerful legacy. She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift.\" Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. \"Lauren's message was constantly positive,\" he told CNN. \"We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive.\" As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the \"true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership.\" \"The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many,\" Twitter user Just_AP wrote. \"Lauren Hill did that.\" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's \"enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story.\" \"Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on,\" he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. \"I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,\" she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time. She had already committed to play for Mount St. Joseph when she was diagnosed. In October, the school received permission from the NCAA to move up its first scheduled game so Hill could play. In front of a sellout crowd, many wearing T-shirts bearing her name and slogan, \"Never Give Up,\" watched the ballplayer score the first two points and the final layup of the game. \"Today has been the best day I've ever had,\" Hill told the crowd after the game. \"I don't know what to say but thank you.\" CNN's Jill Martin, Emanuella Grinberg and Faith Karimi contributed to this report."}

Booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers, Ryan Gosling's first feature as director has been divisive, to put it mildly. But there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole: its setting, a besmirched and decaying Detroit. Wavering on the brink of annihilation, yet providing kindling for its own rebirth, the city is captured in all its waning splendor, the perfect backdrop for Gosling's post-industrial gothic. Speaking about the film in London, Gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact, without Detroit's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all. Gosling said that \"Lost River\" began as a collection of speculative shots of the Brewster-Douglass Projects, the first black social housing development in America and a place Motown legends The Supremes and boxer Joe Louis once called home. \"I heard [the authorities] were going to tear them down,\" Gosling said. \"I had to shoot them before they did.\" Taking time out between acting jobs, he ventured into the projects. \"I started shooting more and more,\" he explained, \"and then I realized that I was making a film. Then I started writing [the script] during the process of filming.\" Gosling's affection for the Motor City is longstanding, the actor growing up \"not too far away\" in Cornwall, Ontario. \"It seemed like everything cool came from Detroit... the whole American Dream,\" he reminisces. \"The Model-T, Motown, the refrigerator...\" Now though he references \"40 miles of dead neighborhoods,\" the city declaring bankruptcy. \"Houses are burning and things are being torn down,\" he says, \"and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes. For them it has become a nightmare and I wanted to make a film about that.\" The title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced, its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions. Speaking in broader terms, Gosling argues \"there are Lost Rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having.\" On screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted. The director plainly states that as a location it \"was pretty dangerous.\" He describes \"an energy there that was threatening... We had a very charmed experience [filming]. It worked its way into the fabric of the movie --- a tone of impending threat that was just there.\" However there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos, on camera and off. For the film's young protagonist, every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed. Similarly, Gosling references the Heidelberg Project during the discussion, a community organization in the city's McDougall-Hunt neighborhood, reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists. He recalls seeing \"one house covered with teddy bears, another covered in clocks... people taking spaces and personalizing them.\" The city's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw. \"Something really interesting is happening in Detroit at the moment -- a rebirth. People redefining what they are,\" according to Gosling. \"There's a resilience there and an energy, and it's exciting.\" As much as the visual content of \"Lost River\" revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world's perception of Detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city. Gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing Detroit, and is precisely what the film is trying to convey. \"We want people to know that dereliction is happening there, but that it's not only what is happening there,\" he argues. \"It doesn't define Detroit, it's just part of what it's dealing with right now.\" \"Lost River\" receives a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and UK on April 10."}

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report."}

What exactly is \"service of process\"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go \"off the grid\". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is \"nail and mail\" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of \"service\" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, \"traditional\" doesn't necessarily mean \"good.\"  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be \"liked\" by all your gawking \"friends,\" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we \"live\" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.

Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified \"treatment,\" Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday \"lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,\" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. \"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. \"The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,\" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about \"how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies.\" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report."}

He was born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900. He has been subject to American law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen. The Constitution would agree.  The Fourteenth Amendment declares that \"All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Yet, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen.  How can it be, in the 21st century, that Americans born on U.S. soil are denied the rights of citizenship? That injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of American Samoa to join the United States.  It is a wrong that Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision could come any day. Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens.  The rule is colorblind, yet the only exception that the Supreme Court has ever declared was not. The infamous Dred Scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free African-Americans had \"no rights that the white man was bound to respect.\"  Though they were Americans, they were not citizens under the Constitution. A Civil War later, the 14th Amendment reversed the ruling in the Dred Scott case. Today, the Dred Scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. But racial discrimination didn't end there. In 1904, a Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez sailed for New York.  Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen.  But officials at Ellis Island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland.  She sued, with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling. Yet the Supreme Court that eventually heard Gonzalez's case was still racist.  In preceding years, for example, it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the Chinese race. And, in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as Puerto Rico, the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class U.S. territories.  Justice Edward Douglas White's opinion stated that U.S. sovereignty extended over them, but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other Americans.  He did so, he privately revealed, because \"he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions.\" In the Gonzalez case, the justices agreed unanimously that Puerto Ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws.  But they declined to decide whether or not Gonzalez was a citizen.  Though preoccupied by fears that islanders were \"savages\" and racially unfit for citizenship, they were unwilling to violate the Constitution. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to \"precedents in our history of which we are least proud.\" Those precedents, he warned the Court, had been \"repudiated by the American people in the Civil War, by three amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by this court, and by ... advancing civilization.\" Surely, 147 years after the Dred Scott case was overturned, the time has come to put an end to this farce. In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Today, Emy Afalava and his fellow American Samoans are the last Americans still waiting to become citizens."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 826, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "London (CNN)The Pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25-30% of Iraqi territory seized by ISIS. The map, above, shows gains in key central and northern areas of Iraq where the terror group was previously the dominant force. The gains made in the fight against the terror group by Iraqi security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive -- although as the U.S. Department of Defense acknowledges it's a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on \"daily fluctuations in the battle lines.\" So, how exactly should we read this information? What does it say about the wider fight against ISIS? CNN asked Afzal Ashraf, a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the Royal United Services Institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against ISIS in Iraq. Below is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: So, is the tide turning in Iraq -- is the coalition winning? Afzal Ashraf: When it comes to insurgencies it's always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change. The one difference between ISIS and insurgencies in general is that ISIS declared itself a state, a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them. (There have been) significant gains against ISIS -- particularly in Tikrit -- and it's no coincidence we've seen ISIS make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in Syria. It's asymmetric warfare, they know they cannot hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere. They have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere. It continues their image of initiative, of shocking, of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do. CNN: What does the map tell us about the coalition's strategy? AA: It's very telling. There are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the Iraqi forces. It's a push against the front line of ISIS rather than being brave and creative and going in behind ISIS's lines and breaking it up. What this isn't is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push. The capability you need (for this kind of warfare) is much more high-tech than the capabilities the Iraqis have. Those capabilities are available in the region -- Jordanians, Egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it's very interesting that the Middle Eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target ISIS which is an existential threat. CNN: What about Ramadi? ISIS seems to be winning there. AA: Ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade. But in this context (ISIS) will ... be pushing in Ramadi because that's an area they have lots of support. It also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains. The concept of success is hugely important to them -- it's what sustains the recruitment effort of ISIS. Nobody wants to join a bunch of losers, so it's very important for them to be seen to be succeeding. Above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media. They are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in Nimrud and killing refugees in camps like Yarmouk. But where it counts they are not standing and fighting."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 925, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops."}

One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, \"stuff\" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as \"audit protection insurance,\" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the \"found money\" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?"}

She steadied herself against the podium in the Fall River, Massachusetts, courtroom and occasionally paused. She was tired after more than two years of pain, punctuated Wednesday when her son's killer, Aaron Hernandez, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Odin Lloyd was her first born, her only son. \"Odin was the backbone of the family. Odin was the man of the house. Odin was his sisters' keeper,\" Ward told Judge Susan Garsh, before Garsh sentenced the  former pro-football player. Lloyd was 27-years-old and working for a landscaping firm when he was killed in June 2013. He played football for the Boston Bandits, the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winner of four championships in the New England Football League, according to the team's website. His mother, sister, uncle and cousin described him as a champion of family, a gifted athlete and a hard worker with a sense of humor. They said he rode his bike several miles to get to work. He went to all of his niece's recitals. \"Odin was my first best gift I (will) ever receive,\" his mother said. \"I thank God (for) every second and every day of my son's life that I spent with him. \"The day I laid my son Odin to rest,\" she continued, pausing to maintain her composure, \"I think my heart stopped beating for a moment. I felt like I wanted to go into that hole with my son, Odin.\" She can still hear him talking to her: \"'Ma, did you cook? Ma, go to bed. Ma, you're so beautiful.'\" Ed Lloyd followed Ward to address the judge. Odin Lloyd's uncle thanked everyone who worked on the case against Hernandez. His nephew, he said, \"meant a lot to me.\" \"To see how he grew, the respect he had, the toughest thing for me is that I won't get to see him have a child...,\" Ed Lloyd said. He loved watching his nephew and his son together. \"A lot of people won't see from the outside the value and the riches (Odin Lloyd) had,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for where I stand today but I know that all the time I had with him was special and he'll always be with me.\" Who was Odin Lloyd? Odin Lloyd's sister Olivia Thibou wept as she explained what it has felt like to lose her brother. \"These last couple years have been the hardest of our lives,\" she said, recalling that she was asked to writer her brother's eulogy.  \"I got to write all the great memories I have of him.\" She laughed, recalling his insistence on wearing the same Adidas flip-flops until the soles wore away. He was \"prideful,\" she said. He would take her car out and just when she was starting to angry, he'd pull in with the car shining and clean, inside and out. He taught her daughter how to ride a bike. His murder, she said, \"feels like a bad dream.\" Ward told the court that she constantly thinks about her son. \"I miss my baby boy Odin so much,\" she said. \"But I know I'm going to see him again someday and that has given me the strength to go on.\" She has also apparently gained strength from the act of forgiveness. \"I forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son's murder,\" she said. \"I pray and hope that someday everyone out there will forgive them also.\" What's next for Aaron Hernandez?"}

A second man, who allegedly knew about the bomb plot but didn't call authorities, was charged with failing to report a felony. John T. Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb, the criminal complaint said. The \"bomb\" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley's security was never breached and no people were in danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release. Booker enlisted in the Army last year and was due to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, \"Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord.\" Booker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Hassan opened fire in a building in November 2009, killing 13 people and wounding more than 30. His enlistment was terminated March 24, 2014, at the request of Army Criminal Investigation Command, Hall said. Booker began communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans to engage in violent jihad in support of ISIS. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when ordered to shoot the enemy. On March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that's home to the 1st Infantry Division, known as \"The Big Red One.\" Booker said \"that detonating a suicide bomb is his No. 1 aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target,\"  the criminal complaint said. He made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said. Booker acquired components for a bomb and rented a storage locker to store the components, the complaint said. The plan was for confidential informants to build a bomb and for Booker to drive to Fort Riley and detonate it, the complaint said. But the bomb was built with \"inert\" parts and would never explode, the complaint said. On Friday, the informants and Booker drove to what Booker thought was a little-used utility gate near Fort Riley, the complaint said. While Booker was making final connections on the \"bomb,\" the FBI arrested him, the complaint said. He was charged with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, one count of attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and one count of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq, a designated foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Alexander E. Blair, 28, of Topeka was taken into custody Friday and charged with failing to report a felony. The FBI said agents interviewed Blair after Booker's arrest. Blair said he shared some of Booker's views, knew of his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley and loaned him money to rent storage space, according to the FBI's criminal complaint. He said he thought Booker would carry out his plan but did not contact authorities, the complaint said. If convicted, Blair faces a maximum of three years in prison."}

After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety \"It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever.\" But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. \"Furious 7\" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu went on to win best director for \"Birdman.\" The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie \"Selma,\" which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag \"#OscarsSoWhite.\" In contrast, \"Furious 7\" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. \"We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates),\" Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. \"They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country.\" Almost since the beginning, the \"Fast and Furious\" films have had a diverse focus and appeal.  The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, \"Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies.\" \"They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent,\" he said. \"They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)\" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. \"Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white,\" EW's Chris Lee writes. \"According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles.\" At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. \"It doesn't matter what nationality you are,\" the star said. \"As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.' That's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved.\""}

The marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives. During the protest march Thursday, Twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns. #PeaceMarch and #SayNoToXenophobia were some of the most popular. South African Police Services said more than 10,000 people attended the march, including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations. Hashtags are now pouring out of South Africa. But many are asking, some via Twitter, is it enough to fight #xenophobia? Attacks this week in Durban alone have killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. For South African Tim Flack, tweeting wasn't going to make a bit of difference. Flack, who lives in Cape Town, has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who he said referred to foreigners as \"lice\" and has said \"they should pack their bags and go.\" \"People listen to him,\" Flack said. \"He is a monarch. The Zulu people in South Africa take him very seriously, they don't question what he says.\" Flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they weren't enough. So he filed a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, and then tweeted about it. \"The activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times,\" Flack said. \"I want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it won't cost them anything, but I will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being.\" Now, the Human Rights Commission must decide whether to investigate Flack's allegations against the King, who denies fueling any violence. Flack hopes others will also make complaints. Flack added that Zulus aren't the only people in South Africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment. \"People are frustrated and unemployed, and people in South Africa pay foreign nationals a lot less,\" he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants. \"A domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house, whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand, so it causes resentment.\" Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairman of the Gift of Givers Foundation in Durban, doesn't think most South Africans are against foreigners. \"South Africans are against xenophobia,\" said Sooliman, who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals. Gift of Givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the South African government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees, he said, passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs. The organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia. Why? \"In South Africa, everyone knows xenophobia,\" Sooliman said, \"and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand. So if you say #tsunami or #war, people follow it. So here, people say #xenophobia, and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster, so you are going to post what people understand.\" He said South Africans also have been going to the camps, which are on sports fields with makeshift tents, bringing cooked food and other necessities. \"This is different from what happened in 2008,\" Sooliman said. That year, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. Sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence, community engagement is happening now as it never happened before. It is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story: #WeAreAfrica. Only time, or, tweets will tell if it works."}

His photo's appearance on milk cartons after his May 1979 disappearance marked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. On Friday, more than 35 years after frenzied media coverage of his case horrified parents everywhere, a New York jury will again deliberate over a possible verdict against the man charged in his killing, Pedro Hernandez. He confessed to police three years ago. Etan Patz's parents have waited that long for justice, but some have questioned whether that is at all possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to discern whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an \"IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,\" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. \"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,\" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was reportedly immediately rearrested upon exiting jail in 2012 on failure to register as a sex offender. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. \"It awakened America,\" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \"It was the beginning of a missing children's movement.\" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Former President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. Joe Sterling and CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report."}

As poll watchers, they surely knew that most Americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago. But the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses, including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality. They had better adjust to a new reality. For the past three decades, socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations, environmental initiatives and social welfare programs, while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in America's population. For many, this alliance been puzzling: Other, equally devout Christians who place more emphasis on Jesus Christ's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor, have been uncomfortable with it, as have many business leaders. Their priorities, after all, are based on the bottom line. And companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line. Hence, after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples, the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift, from groups as diverse as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Indiana Pacers, Walmart, Eli Lilly, Apple and even the Marriott International hotel chain. Marriott International was founded by J.W. Marriott, a dedicated Mormon, and is now run by his son Bill, also a Mormon who fully accepts his church's teachings about traditional marriage.  Yet in June, Marriott International launched a \"#Love Travels\" marketing campaign, aimed at attracting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of \"the company's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are.\" Asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same-sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same-sex honeymooners, Marriott pointed to the Bible's injunction of unconditional love, but added \"beyond that, I am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business.\" In 2014, global spending by LGBT travelers was estimated at more than $200 billion, and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel. So Marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome. Businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias.  A CNN poll taken in February found that 72% of millennials nationwide believe that same-sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid.  Even among white evangelical Protestants, 43% of millennials support same-sex marriage, compared with less than 20% of those their grandparents' age, 68 and older. It used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts, but that is no longer possible. According to researchers for MTV's \"Look Different\" anti-bias campaign, 90% of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place, and almost 80% say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias. So who's the \"moral majority\" now? For media-savvy millennials, following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it. In the first 24 hours after Arkansas passed its version of the \"religious freedom\" bill, the Twitter hashtag #BoycottArkansas was used 12,000 times. It then snowballed after celebrity blogger Perez Hilton tweeted it to his 5.9 million Twitter followers. America has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity, whether that pertains to race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Since 2011, the majority of children that have been born in the United States each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities.  Hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060. Women now lead men in educational attainment. And more than half of Americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal. Business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril."}

Sahra, a Somali refugee, left her home at 14 years old. Throughout her journey in search of asylum, she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts. But she never gave up, and she continuously reminded herself to keep going. She's the focus of Ines Dumig's photo series \"Apart Together.\" Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims. What drew Dumig to Sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences. \"It really impressed me how she deals with everything,\" Dumig said. \"She's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened, the culture where she comes from.\" The number of refugees seeking asylum in the European Union increased by 25% last year, with Germany receiving the most applications. One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle. Another reason has to do with Dumig's interest in people's emotions and finding one's identity. \"I realized so many people want to come to Europe, and I always had the feeling to disappear or to go away,\" Dumig said. \"Seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged I am.\" \"Apart Together\" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds. The title of Dumig's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another, the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together. \"Sometimes we feel strong, sometimes we feel lost -- that's kind of universal, I think,\" Dumig said. \"That's why I want to universalize (Sahra's) story as well, not only make it about her.\" The underlying themes of \"Apart Together\" include the feelings of isolation and \"otherness\" and the search for a valuable human dignity. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document,\" Dumig said. \"But they are a person, they are people with emotions and lives.\" Sahra is currently under the status of \"suspension of deportation,\" meaning German immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation. Dumig describes Sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation. Regardless of the challenges Sahra faces as a refugee in Germany, she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience, determined to establish a new life for herself. She has learned to speak German fluently, and she has started working in the nation as well. Like an unsolved photographic puzzle, each photo within \"Apart Together\" provides a piece of insight into Sahra's experiences. There is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces, because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of Sahra's life. Many of Dumig's photos are not of Sahra herself, but instead show her surroundings. This makes \"Apart Together\" rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions. The photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature, as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one. \"I think everyone interprets by themselves, by however way they perceive it through their own experience. That's up to the viewer,\" Dumig said. \"It depends on who looks at the pictures. ... Everyone will see something different.\" \"Apart Together\" allowed Dumig to share various special moments with Sahra, and they were both able to learn from each other. \"It was just something we both got something out of,\" Dumig said. Ines Dumig is a photographer based in Germany."}

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family's lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. \"The boys are in rough shape,\" Maron said. \"The family are all fighters,\" he added. \"They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.\" Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. \"It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\" Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family's attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. \"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" \"We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as \"serious.\""}

After class, she eats boiled sweets, one after another -- they are a cheap form of energy. The dancer, raised in California and Texas, left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in Russia six years ago, aged 15, speaking no Russian. She studied at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and was one of the first Americans accepted from the school into the company. But in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed Boshoi official to pay $10,000 to dance in even small roles. The Bolshoi still stands by comments made at the time by its general director, Vladimir Urin. He asked the dancer to make an official complaint and defend her position legally, saying the theatre was ready to assist the law enforcement agencies to investigate the case and that \"if the facts are legally established, those responsible should be punished accordingly.\" The dancer did not pursue a case against the Bolshoi. When she left the Bolshoi in 2013, Womack joined the Kremlin Ballet Theatre where she still works, aged 20, as a principal ballerina; dancing close to the Russian president's office, next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the Kremlin. The surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not: for her role as a principal dancer Womack says she is paid around $240 a month -- which works out at around $8 a day. The dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the Russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered, in part, from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea last year. Womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food. \"For anyone paid a salary in rubles, especially since the crisis, it is extremely difficult. You have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability. I'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more.\" Sitting in the wings of the stage, chatting in Russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for Swan Lake, she says she has to make the $185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks. To earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad. The Kremlin Ballet Theatre says Womack's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that, \"on average, the salary [principal] dancers are paid is significantly higher\" than $240 a month but that Womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars \"depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month.\" As an American, Womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the Russians. But she says that is not always the case offstage. \"It's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the United States and Russia. The great thing about working for a Russian company is that we are focused on creating art but...outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover.\" Although relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken a nosedive since Russia's annexation of Crimea last March, Womack says she is \"very loyal\" to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre. \"I love the Russian system and I'm very patriotic in that sense,\" she says. And despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says, \"Russia has a lot to offer, it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one's career in."}

Scientists studied poor African-Americans in Alabama who'd contracted the venereal disease but didn't tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them. A lawsuit filed this week alleges Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation helped conduct a similar study in Guatemala from 1945 to 1956. Orphans, inmates, psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs, including penicillin, worked best in stopping the diseases, the lawsuit says. The subjects of the experiments weren't told they'd been infected, the lawsuit says, causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses, sexual partners and children. The suit seeks more than $1 billion in damages and has 774 plaintiffs, including people who were subjects in the experiments and their descendants. This is the second attempt to collect damages. In 2012, a class-action federal lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government over the Guatemala experiments conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service. A judge dismissed it, saying the Guatemalans could not sue the United States for grievances that happened overseas. The new lawsuit was filed in the Baltimore City Circuit Court. Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation filed statements on their websites condemning the experiments, but denying responsibility. \"The plaintiffs' essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members' participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable,\" the Johns Hopkins statement said. \"Neither assertion is true.\" The lawsuit alleges the Rockefeller Foundation funded Johns Hopkins' research into public health issues, including venereal disease, and employed scientists who monitored the Guatemala experiments. The lawsuit, the Rockefeller Foundation statement said, \"seeks improperly to assign 'guilt by association' in the absence of compensation from the United States federal government.\" The suit says Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation designed, supported and benefited from the Guatemala experiments. Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical group and that company's owner, Mead Johnson, also are defendants. The pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments, the suit says. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb sent this statement to CNN: \"We've only just received the complaint in this matter. Bristol-Myers Squibb played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease. As a company dedicated to patients, we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations.\" Nobody doubts the experiments happened. In 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Guatemala for the experiments, saying they were \"clearly unethical.\" In the 1930s and 1940s, the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors, the suit says. The lawsuit says John Hopkins controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease. The lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects. A woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes, the suit says. The lawsuit doesn't say why the experiments ended. The results were never published and were not revealed until 2011, when the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues wrote a letter to President Barack Obama telling of its investigation, the suit says.

However these days, they can take a stroll around Victoria Island, an exclusive neighborhood in Lagos where brands like Porsche, Hugo Boss and Ermenegildo Zegna line the streets. The Nigerian city is among African metropolises which have seen some of the highest growth in the number of millionaires on the continent. Others include Luanda, Dar es Salaam and Accra, which is predicted to nearly double its millionaire count from 800 in 2012 to 1,500 in 2020. If the growth continues, these cities could join an existing club of African wealth hubs hosting the so-called ultra-high net worth individuals, typically those with over $30 million of net assets excluding their primary residence. These centers of affluence  are spread from Johannesburg in the south, through Lagos in the west and Nairobi in the east, to Cairo in the north. This emerging class of Africa's new millionaires has been pushing the demand for luxury products across the continent, with sales of high-end products growing by a third between 2008 and 2013. However, they are no longer concentrated in southern Africa, traditionally the wealthiest part of the continent. Nigeria is now one of the fastest growing markets for French Champagne and digital televisions according to a report by Deloitte, and in 2013 LVMH's seven Nigerian branches outsold its 600 South African stores. \"Africa is one of the fastest growing regions in terms of middle class,\" says Fflur Roberts, head of luxury at Euromonitor, a market research provider. \"It's due to a mix of rising incomes, rising population but also growth slowing in other emerging markets.\" Luxury brands tend to enter country markets through distributors, benefiting from local knowledge of their partners but still retaining a significant amount of control over how their name is marketed in that country. \"Getting a new brand in a new market where they don't fully understand the operating environment would be very dangerous for that brand,\" explains Roberts. She warns that in spite of potential, the future of luxury in Africa is dependent on reforms taking place: \"It will rely on infrastructure and the operating environment such as security and how trading is done,\" she says. When it comes to what they choose to splash their cash on, Africa's rich like to stick to well-known global labels that carry an automatic badge of status. \"Generally the brands they buy will be more ostentatious  compared to somebody in the more developed, mature markets. It's going to be the Louis Vuitton, the Gucci, the Prada,\" says Roberts. She adds that this could be down to the fact that typical a luxury consumer in Africa is much younger than those in mature markets such as Western Europe, who tend to be in their 50s and 60s. \"They are in their late twenties or thirties so it's very much new wealth, and they will be looking towards luxury as a means of showing status and success,\" says Roberts. However, in spite of mainstream brand's dominance, smaller home-grown labels also see the growth in appetite for luxury goods as a valuable opportunity. \"Africa has all the foundations that are needed to create a real vibrant luxury industry,\" says Swaady Martin Leke, Ivorian entrepreneur and founder of the Johannesburg-based luxury tea brand Yswara. \"We have the craftsmanship, we have the heritage, we have a very rich culture that doesn't date just 20 years, but centuries, thousands and thousands of years of know-how and craftsmanship. So here is this continent where you have all the raw material and the know-how, but what is missing is the link to luxury. \"Now is the time and you need to start positioning yourself, because Africa is getting richer, that's for sure,\" she adds.

The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented, with declines in tourism and the seafood industry, as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region. Since then, the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery. In fact, reports indicate that the Gulf of Mexico's seafood industry, which supplies the United States with roughly 40% of its seafood, is finally starting to rebound. However, profound challenges remain, in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered. To this day, it's still unclear where all of the oil went, exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating. One of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the Gulf crab. Crabs play an important role in the region: Roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the Gulf in 2012, earning tens of millions in revenue. Yet in the aftermath of the spill, changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye. Researchers documented substantial differences in appearance, and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints, forcing limbs to fall off. These traits have affected not only the crabs' market value but also likely their ability to survive. While these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term, the health of these crabs could still be precarious. I have been working with colleagues at Florida International University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill. Using the power of genomics and computational biology, we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the Macondo Prospect where the Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. By studying gene expression, the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell, we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and, based on the types of changes we might see, clues as to how the crabs respond. Although we are still in the early stages of our research, we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant. We are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce. It's not just Gulf crabs that are experiencing changes. Research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill. This not only has consequences for the Gulf area, where oil drilling continues, but also for communities along the Atlantic Coast, where the Obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration. (BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, told CNN that wildlife species in the Gulf have \"bounced back and \"there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\") With the virtual certainty of more spills, we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently. The U.S. Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are making some progress. In coming months, they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill. But government agencies cannot just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis. Instead, the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing, long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what \"normal\" looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill. Only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources."}

Farage, the leader of  the UK Independence Party (UKIP), complains that Britain's membership of the European Union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants, many from impoverished Eastern Europe, into his \"small island\" nation. In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. \"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40,\" Zylinksi said. Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword. I don't have one but I'm sure we could find one if we had to. But I'm not intending to accept the offer,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. \"I would have thought that a Polish prince with a long Polish lineage would rather agree with me that it's a complete tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people.\" UKIP wants Britain to leave the European Union. It says it would not seek to remain a party to the region's free trade or economic treaties \"while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.\" It has also pledged to cut the country's £9 billion ($12.4B) annual foreign aid budget. Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles. Enough is enough, I say, this has got to stop.\" Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a \"wonderful work ethic\" and easy integration into the community. \"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know,\" he said. \"We are very grateful to be here. We would like you to be grateful too. Please stop knocking the Poles. We love this country we would like British to love us too.\""}

The commando asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals and because he was not authorized to speak. Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at the school. Of the fatalities, 142 were students at the university, and the rest were security forces and campus security. At 7:00 a.m. local time, the response team was told to assemble for a mission to Garissa, the police commando told CNN.  At 8:00 a.m., he said, the team was told there were no police aircraft available to take them. A reserve team was then sent by road, while the main commando team waited in Nairobi for air transport, he said. Once told aircraft would be available, it took the commando team nearly two hours to travel the roughly 22 miles (35 kilometers) to the airport because of the heavy traffic, the commando source said. But Kenya's Police Air Wing Chief Col. Rogers Mbithi denied that his unit caused any delay in the response to the university attack. Mbithi told CNN two fixed wing aircraft were ready and waiting for the commandos 45 minutes before the police commandos were ready to depart around 12:30 p.m. local time. Government names Kenya attack mastermind . Mbithi conceded that one of the two aircraft ultimately used to transport the commandos to Garissa left Nairobi at 7:30 a.m. to fly to Mombasa on a scheduled flight, hours after the Garissa terror attack began. That plane picked up the chief's daughter-in-law and two children, and returned to Nairobi at its scheduled time of 11:39 a.m., Mbithi said. The first aircraft carrying police commandos eventually departed for Garissa at 12:30 p.m., followed by a second aircraft about 10 minutes later, Mbithi said. Inside college dorm's scene of slaughter . After arriving in Garissa by plane, the commando team rehearsed the assault on the university compound for about two-and-a-half hours, the commando source told CNN. The police assault to retake the university compound began around 5 p.m. and lasted about 15 minutes. One commando was killed in the assault.  All four Al-Shabaab attackers were killed. Another law enforcement source told CNN that by 7:00 a.m. the Al-Shabaab terrorists had already killed most of the students, saying: \"It was never a hostage situation.\" The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts . Other Kenyan officials have previously defended the response to the university attack. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's President and deputy president, told CNN last week that in emergency situations there is always criticism regarding whether governments reacted as fast as they could have or should have. \"With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,\" he said. Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and \"got the job done,\" he said. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told CNN the response was sufficient and denied reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. Lillian Leposo reported in Nairobi. Lonzo Cook reported in Atlanta. CNN's Jethro Mullen also contributed to this report."}

The lack of humidity provides optimal conditions to watch the sky and study the origins of the universe. \"It is pure visual silence,\" said photographer Andres Figueroa. \"It is amazing. There is absolutely no humidity, and (these conditions) create some striking contrasts.\" There, in that clear, inhospitably arid environment, Figueroa turned his camera lens toward another discussion on cosmology, one rooted in the ancient folklore of the Andean people. Taking along his mobile lighting studio, Figueroa photographed a series of religious festivals that take place every July in the Atacama. In his \"Dancers of the Deserts\" series, Figueroa chronicles these festivals, which attract about 200,000 people to some otherwise quiet mining towns in Chile. \"I have always wanted to see the desert. Even though I am not very religious, I've always been curious about their traditions,\" said Figueroa, who is from the Chilean capital of Santiago. Figueroa worked hard on cataloging and differentiating the ceremonies and their complex rituals -- at times playing the role of an artist, others as an anthropologist -- but he always remained faithful to his love for classic portraiture. \"From an anthropological standpoint, I was interested in documenting all the signs and symbols that appear in each costume and character, all the indigenous and Catholic syncretism,\" he said. \"My lighting studio allowed me to pick up on these details. \"From a portraiture standpoint, I used a formal approach to explain this living culture that is constantly growing and reinventing itself. I asked each character to stop to be photographed, taking them away momentarily from the festival in a more intimate scenario.\" Photographing adobe walls, desert landscapes and the ubiquitous camping sites where pilgrims come to gather, Figueroa said each character is perched in his or her own context.

These photos highlight the uniqueness of Andean culture, which draws influences from Europe, the Inca and more recently, Chinese traditions. There are endless nuances, not always perceived by the naked eye. \"It is a very special festival. When you see the bears, you see them participating in the different roles, blending in with the (the devils),\" Figueroa said. \"And sometimes, you see them as a central figure in a festival of their own. It is amazing, a tradition brought by the Chinese near Peru.\" Figueroa, who befriended many of the musicians and dancers, said it was important to take part in the festival in order to understand its meaning to the community. \"I had to understand the hierarchy and protocols of each group,\" he said. \"As a photographer, it is important to create the conditions for things to happen. You can have it all planned and set up in order for things to naturally take place.\" Figueroa said the desert festivals have a deeper role in a region that struggles with social problems such as drug trafficking and poverty. It is the glue that binds families, and young people heavily invest their time and money to make their costumes and parade with pride. The festivals \"are a form of social protection,\" Figueroa said. \"I felt the presence of love ...  their love and effort in communicating with their divinity and holding together as communities.\" Andres Figueroa is a Chilean photographer.

CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a \"serial litigant,\" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and \"if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge.\" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was \"hardly an acceptable form of greeting,\" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language \"screamed 'I don't like that.'\" \"As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',\" read the post. \"As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'\" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of \"a bit of banter,\" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. \"We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,\" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. \"But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry.\" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. \"A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,\" New Zealand media reported her as saying. \"It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving.\" Jackie Blue, head of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, echoed the sentiment. \"It's never OK to touch someone without their permission,\" TVNZ reported her as saying. \"There are no exceptions.\" Political analyst Bryce Edwards told the network that the \"strangeness factor\" of the accusation would haunt Key. \"A lot of people will be laughing at John Key, that's harder to recover from,\" he said in a segment. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, while accepting that Key was joking and did not mean to offend, criticized the premier. \"The fact that our Prime Minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture. And it starts at the top,\" the organization's chief executive Sue McCabe wrote in an open letter. \"Up and down this country, day after day, people are touched without giving their consent.

The conflict is exacting a heavy toll on children and families, UNICEF said in a statement. \"The humanitarian situation is worsening all the time, with increasingly limited access to water, basic sanitation and critical health services,\" the statement quoted UNICEF Yemen representative Julien Harneis, speaking from Amman, Jordan, as saying. \"The supplies we have managed to bring in today can make the difference between life and death for children and their families -- but we know they are not enough, and we are planning more of these airlifts.\" Aid agencies have been saying that supplies were desperately needed, but getting them into the country in the midst of regional turmoil was difficult. UNICEF said its cargo included antibiotics, bandages, syringes, IV sets and other medical supplies. Included as well, the agency said, were micronutrients for up to 20,000 children and water storage materials airlifted through Djibouti from UNICEF's supply center in Denmark. Also Friday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said that about 900 refugees from Yemen have arrived in the Horn of Africa. Many more are reportedly trying to make the trip but are hampered by fuel shortages and high fees by boat operators. \"UNHCR is extremely concerned about the dangers for anyone trying to flee across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, where there are no search and rescue operations,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Last year, 246 lives were reported lost in sea crossings to Yemen. UNHCR appeals to all ships in the area to be extra vigilant and assist any boats in distress. We also ask that countries with vessels in waters near Yemen -- including surveillance and anti-piracy vessels -- instruct their ships to help with rescues.\" It said that, as demand increases, the boats attempting the dangerous crossing are likely to become more crowded -- a crossing that has historically been made in the other direction, by people fleeing Africa in favor of Yemen . Many Yemenis are attempting the trip in rickety fishing boats. One family told CNN the crossing was \"a window into hell.\" And underscoring the increasing toll being exacted by the conflict in Yemen, the World Health Organization said Friday that at least 643 people have been killed in the country since the fighting escalated three weeks ago. But it acknowledged that the number was almost certainly an underestimate. \"As of 6 April 2015 there have been a total of 643 deaths and 2,226 injuries,\" the WHO, the health arm of the United Nations, said in a statement. \"Casualty estimates are likely to change in the coming days as additional cases are verified and reported.\" The figures cover the period from March 19 to April 6. They include, however, only deaths and injuries verified by a health facility. Other deaths and injuries have undoubtedly occurred. Security in the country, which is on the Arabian Peninsula, deteriorated sharply last month when Houthi rebels advanced on Sanaa and the port city of Aden, forcing President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to flee the country. Since then, Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes meant to halt the advance of the Houthis. In at least one case, according to Houthi sources, one of those strikes hit a school."}

An economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $24 trillion, one that annually churns out the equivalent of $2.5 trillion, is under assault. However, I am not referring to one of the G8 economies, but to the \"super economy\" of the ocean. It's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast. The health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a WWF report released Thursday, Reviving the Ocean Economy. The report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by The Boston Consulting Group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the Global Change Institute of the University of Queensland. True, the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal. But it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations. The fact is that the ocean feeds us, employs us, offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world. The ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity, such as climate regulation and oxygen production, that are difficult to put in monetary terms. And while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives, no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us. A figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling: Seventy percent of the ocean's overall economic value relies on its continued health. Ocean assets like fisheries, coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them. That may seem like a far-off possibility to some, but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report. For example, 90 percent of the world's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited. And that is not all. By 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs, which have already been halved in the last few decades. This isn't just a concern for dive enthusiasts, but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks. The ocean is truly too big to fail. The loss of the ocean's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage. Fortunately, our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy, three of which are critical this year. First, the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being. Also, negotiators meeting in Paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change. And finally, leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years. The economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear, and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy. Reviving the Ocean Economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome, but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers. All this said, and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean's health has been its fastest in millions of years, there is actually some (potential) good news: If we act swiftly and with determination, marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly. Many local examples -- from the Mediterranean to the Mozambique Channel, from the Fiji archipelago to the Arctic -- show us that conservation, restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean, and the people who depend on it, can both prosper. Ultimately, the ocean bridges continents, connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource. But if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return, we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate. After all, it's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces."}

Then more ominously on December 23 last year, computers at the country's nuclear operator were breached.  Again cybercrime was suspected. The source of these attacks? North Korea. And South Korean investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks. They shared this data with CNN. The 2013 attack, known as \"Dark Seoul,\" paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters, disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean. \"It would try to delete essentially all your files... then restart the system. You would come back up and nothing would be there,\" Joshua James, a digital forensic expert, told CNN. \"If it infected more financial systems, it could have deleted all financial data in Korea. I mean, it is dangerous,\" the visiting professor at Chuncheon's Hallym University added. Live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down, while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals, or transfer money online. \"Dark Seoul\" happened shortly after the North Korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year Korean War to an end in July 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor. The latest high-profile digital incursion, in December, attempted to steal data from South Korea's nuclear operator, including plant blueprints and personnel information. Though investigators said no critical data was stolen, the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs. The attack itself was described by James as a \"spear-fishing\" exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email. \"As soon as you double click on it, it starts running in the background of your computer where you can't see ... it's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker,\" he told CNN. The attack, which James said was simpler than \"Dark Seoul,\" came just a few days after Sony Pictures said their systems has been \"hacked,\" another attack the South Korean authorities blamed on North Korea. \"From a law enforcement or investigation side, we're trying to actually trace back to who did it,\" said James. Seoul announced in mid-March that some of the IP addresses used in December incursion could be traced back to Shenyang, China, which can be easily accessed from the North Korean border. Codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the North Koreans, South Korean authorities said. \"The malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as \"Kimsuky\" codes known to be used by North Korea,\" the prosecutor's office that leads 17 other government agencies and Internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in March. Pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks, calling them a \"plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth.\" But many experts say North Korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival. Indeed South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates that North Korea is operating a \"cyberarmy\" of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability. \"Hacks are going on all the time, constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount,\" said James. \"How many are detected in general? I think the average person would have no clue they've been hacked. \"Organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they're not,\" he added. Many in South Korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks. A report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, a government-funded think tank, estimates that \"Dark Seoul\" caused about $820 million worth of damage. Its report, published in 2014, predicted that by 2020, South Korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $25 billion in economic damage."}

Jakarta has advised consular officials to travel to Indonesia's \"execution island\" -- Nusa Kambangan -- where the ten are being held, though a spokesman for the Attorney General, Tony Spontana, told CNN Friday this is not the required 72-hour notice given to death row convicts before the actual execution. But he said, \"the time is approaching.\" The 10 inmates, from Australia, France, Ghana, the Philippines, Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia, had their petitions for clemency denied by President Joko Widodo in late 2014. The executions, which will be carried out by firing squad, were planned for earlier this year but were postponed after several inmates filed separate legal challenges. On Tuesday, the Indonesian Supreme Court rejected reviews filed by French national Serge Atlaoui and Ghanaian Martin Anderson. \"We're just waiting for one more decision on the judicial review filed by Zainal Abidin and we hope the Supreme Court's decision will come out tomorrow (Friday),\" Spontana added. Abidin is also a drug convict and the only Indonesian citizen in the group. Chan and Sukumaran, members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot, tried to challenge the President's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the State Administrative Court to hear their case. Their lawyers have since filed another review at the Constitutional Court. The Attorney General's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options. Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. In another sign that the execution date may be announced soon, Spontana said Veloso, 30, was moved Friday to Nusa Kambangan, which lies off the coast of West Java. She has been held in a prison in Yogyakarta, Central Java since 2010. The Supreme Court rejected her petition for a judicial review in March but her lawyers were still preparing to file a second review on Monday. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . According to her lawyers, Veloso unknowingly carried drugs into Indonesia and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate. Her entire family has traveled to Indonesia to fulfill her last wish. Older sister Marites Laurente told CNN Friday that Veloso wants to see parents, siblings and two young sons before facing the firing squad. Laurente said that while her sister seemed resigned to her fate, the family still hopes for a stay in her execution. \"The chances are slim but we're hoping for a miracle. That's what we need, a miracle,\" she said. \"If President Widodo kills her, he would kill an innocent person. So please stop them from executing her.\" At the time of the interview, lawyers had not informed the family about news of the attorney general's orders. Veloso's father, Cesar Veloso, 59, suffers from a heart ailment and seemed distraught about his daughter's situation. \"If I find out that my daughter will be executed the next day, I will kill myself first,\" he told CNN late Thursday. \"It's like throwing my child away. She is innocent. I cannot accept it.\" No date has been set for the execution."}

Kelley has been wanted since 2004, accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. His wife, Genevieve Kelley, who's charged with the same crimes, turned herself in to authorities last year, just a few months after the case was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Her trial is scheduled to start next month. The couple is accused of leaving New Hampshire, kidnapping Genevieve Kelley's daughter, Mary Nunes, and beginning a life on the lam when she was 8 years old. At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights. The search for the three spanned the United States, Canada and Central and South America. It ended on Monday, when Scott Kelley and Mary Nunes entered the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and requested passports so they could return to the United States. The consulate notified U.S. Marshals, Berry said, and when Kelley and Nunes flew to Atlanta on Wednesday investigators were waiting for them. Mary Nunes, now 19, was interviewed by investigators at the Atlanta airport to ensure her health and safety and then allowed to continue to her final destination, Berry said.

In a statement released through a private investigator he's hired in the case, her father said that he was thrilled to learn Mary is safe. \"We love Mary and are overjoyed that she is alive and back in the US. Our hearts and home are open to her, and we will do everything we can to insure she remains safe and healthy,\" Mark Nunes said in a statement. \"We remain concerned about her emotional and physical well-being. We look forward to the day our family is finally reunited.\" Kelley's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before allegedly fleeing the country, Genevieve Kelley had accused her ex-husband of abusing their child. Investigators found no basis for the accusations and no charges were filed. On a Facebook page defending her, supporters of the mother say she did what any parent would do under the same circumstances. Photos on the page show her standing with friends holding signs that say, \"Justice for Gen! Children need protection.\" Wayne Rioux, who was then the police chief of Whitefield, New Hampshire, told \"The Hunt\" that a video Genevieve and Scott Kelley made, intended to prove their abuse allegations, aroused his suspicions. Rioux watched the tape for \"any evidence of wrongdoing by Mark Nunes.\" \"But throughout the tape all I saw was this bizarre, strange conduct by the mother,\" Rioux said, \"who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy.\" Attorney Alan Rosenfeld has argued that Genevieve Kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter, after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they didn't believe the abuse allegations. \"Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,\" he said earlier this year, according to WMUR. Earlier this year, Brazilian police tracked down Victor Arden Barnard, another fugitive who'd been featured on \"The Hunt.\" The 53-year-old American pastor is accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota. Last year, the same day Genevieve Kelley was arrested, authorities in Texas announced that in an unrelated case, remains found were confirmed to be those of another fugitive featured on the program, Kevin Patrick Stoeser. Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. Remains of Shane Miller, another suspect featured on the \"The Hunt,\" were found last year. And Charles Mozdir, another suspect who was profiled on the show, was killed in a gunbattle with authorities. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Slma Shelbayah contributed to this report."}

Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded . These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online . Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it."}

The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream. With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep. Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate \"Gang of 8\" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border. His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters. Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a \"horrifying precedent.\" Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, \"We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.\"  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against \"one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday.\"  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous. He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership. Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of \"Obamacare\" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for \"Obamacare\" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.) Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue. Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico. Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters."}

Bates was a reserve deputy sheriff, which allowed him to \"work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair,\" according to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office's website. But Bates wasn't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled. He had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force, according to his lawyer.  On April 2, Bates thought he was going to use a Taser on Eric Harris, who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a Lugar pistol and then took off running. But Bates wasn't holding a Taser. He was holding his gun. He fired one shot and killed Harris. From a policing perspective, there wasn't even good reason to use a Taser against Harris. Cops were on scene. Harris wasn't getting the upper hand. He wasn't going anywhere. And despite what Bates would later claim, Harris was not running like a man with a gun. In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to \"real\" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He donated cars to the department. He gave equipment. So it would be noteworthy if Bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by \"sunglass cameras\" that he may have purchased for the department. A Tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies, many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police. \"That's not unusual at all,\" he told the Tulsa World. Maybe Bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything. But I doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force. He was too old to be policing the streets. Tulsa police said that Bates had served a year in 1964 as a police officer. Most police departments have mandatory retirement ages. Federal law-enforcement officers, for instance, retire at 57. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? Police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers. For one thing, it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free. But departments also know that you get what you pay for. What is the point of background checks, psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol? Some people are a little too eager to be police officers. These people perhaps buy a police-like car for their personal car. Maybe they put in a police light or two. Some have actually made car stops. Police departments hate cop impersonators (it's illegal, by the way) and try and weed them during the hiring process. You want workers who like the job, but not too much; there's a fine line between passion and fanaticism. That said, there are good volunteer police officers. New York City, for example, has auxiliary police. These officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities. They wear an NYPD uniform but do not carry a gun. Auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police. Volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling, and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized SWAT officers. An auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge. It can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn't for them before they are locked into a 20-year commitment. What happened in Tulsa County is a disgrace to police professionalism, and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs. That would be a mistake. Police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public. But a line does need to be drawn."}

Obama's Iran diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up, and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead. The President is headed to Panama for a regional summit, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports one of the big questions is whether he'll make history and have a face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro. \"This would be the first meeting between a U.S. and a Cuban leader in decades,\" said Pace. \"But Obama's efforts to end this freeze of Cuba have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year,\" Pace said.  \"And so what the White House is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the Castros.\" Hillary Clinton has leased her headquarters space in Brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official. And with the launch, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports, will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce Clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children's issues. \"The Democrats around Hillary Clinton believe that while she's one of the most famous people in the world, she's never been properly introduced in her own right,\" said Martin. \"So when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks, look for more biographical touches. We'll hear about her childhood in suburban Chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the Legal Services Corporation and the Children's Defense Fund when she was in her 30s, and also, more about her Arkansas days as first lady, as an advocate for education.\" A lot of the big names signing on to Team Clinton are already known. But Dan Balz of The Washington Post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large, experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles. \"What I'm hearing is that when they launch, this staff is going to be even much, much bigger than we, at this point, imagine, that they have done a huge amount of hiring,\" said Balz. And Balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction. \"She did an event with the wife of the mayor of New York earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they're doing.\" Much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends. But beyond the more tabloidesque details, Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator's staff was soliciting funds for a so-called super PAC -- a violation of campaign finance laws. And she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the Menendez allegations. \"I was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the (Federal Election Commission) really starts to look into this, they're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than Menendez,\" said Kucinich. \"So watch for that if it starts happening.\" By a week from Monday, there will be three official GOP candidates for president: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. Others will soon follow, and as things get more official, pressure is mounting on GOP operatives to choose sides. In New Hampshire this past week, Matt Maroney, a former Mitt Romney alum with ground organizing experience, signed on with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's team. Others in the state reported calls coming in from Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, yes, even Donald Trump. This dynamic plays out on the national level, too: Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, for example, was approached both by Team Christie and by allies of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. In the end, though, Fabrizio signed on with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who makes his official announcement on Tuesday."}

Caller:  \"Hello, I'm trapped in this plane and I called my job, but I'm in this plane.\" Operator:  \"You're where?\" Caller:  \"I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's up moving in the air.  Flight 448 can you please tell somebody (to) stop it.\" The frantic 911 call came just as the Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon.  The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold. The cell phone call soon broke up, but the man was making himself known in other ways as the crew and passengers reported unusual banging from the belly of the Boeing 737. The pilot radioed air traffic control and said he would make an emergency landing. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage. He'll no longer have the option of dozing aboard one of the airline's planes. \"The Menzies employee has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines planes,\" said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for the airline. Flight 448, which was on its way to Los Angeles, only spent 14 minutes in the air. Other than being scared, the agent never was in any real danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. Not everyone heard the banging, but it was soon clear this wasn't a normal flight. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" passenger Marty Collins told affiliate KOMO. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. The agent was off the two days prior to the incident and had taken a lunch break and a break in the afternoon before making his way into the cargo hold, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. It's believed he was hidden by luggage, making it difficult for the rest of his team to see him, the source said. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles a couple of hours late.

The airstrikes Thursday targeted rebel Houthi militant positions in three parts of Sanaa, two Yemeni Defense Ministry officials said. The attacks lasted four hours. The strikes caused no casualties, but did destroy all three military compounds that were targeted, the officials said. They said Saudi airstrikes were also targeting Houthi positions in Lahj province. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly month-long air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, security sources in Taiz said. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. They said explosions lasted for about 40 minutes. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners started pounding Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the Yemeni government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' On Wednesday, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa, a senior Saudi source said on the condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels had captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, who says he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen?

This year is the time and the United Nations' international climate negotiations in Paris in December are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat-trapping emissions. A successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low-carbon economy is underway. The United States has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change. The U.S. administration on Tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.  This common-sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the U.S. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more American energy jobs to power our homes and businesses. This is an area where the United States needs to lead, and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country. The United States isn't alone in this global climate effort. In a landmark joint announcement with the United States in November, China unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero-carbon energy to 20%. This shift will require substantial effort from China to retool its economy, increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal. As the world's No. 1 investor in renewable energy, China has already taken important steps forward. At the same time, India has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022, a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the United States has today. Cities and corporations are joining in as well. More than 200 cities, home to 436 million people, have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. And more than a thousand companies, along with 73 countries, voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies. Leading companies, like Apple and Google, are making major bets on renewable energy. And another 25 businesses have signed onto the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers' Principles—these companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes. Increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy. For instance, renewable sources now provide one-fifth of the world's electricity, while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80% in the last seven years. Wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago. Clean technology investments surged to $310 billion last year. In the United States, carbon emissions fell by 10% from 2007 to 2013, the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded, even as the United States has recovered from the Great Recession. Many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago. Yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate-related impacts that we are already seeing. A global climate agreement in Paris this December can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come. A Paris agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action — a shift from burden-sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities; from cost to investment; from economic threat to a spur to economic development. With the United States showing the way, and with cooperation from other countries, businesses, investors, cities and citizens, we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all. Each year, baseball returns and hope springs eternal. Now, it's time for all countries to get in the game."}

Kagoshima District Court found no \"irrationalities\" in new safety standards set out by the government in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima meltdowns, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported. By dismissing resident's demands, the court ruled that the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima could restart. The first of two reactors is scheduled to go back online in July. The ruling could provide a fillip to the government's plans to bring Japanese nuclear reactors back into operation, more than four years since the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused the failure at TEPCO's Fukushima plant. The original court ruling, which affects the Takahama plant in Fukui Prefecture, cited safety concerns as the reason for the injunction, a court official told CNN. Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's plant. But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake. Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant. Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports. But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart. Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy. \"That was a body blow (for Abe) because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics,\" he said. \"It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it.\" READ MORE: Power company abandons robot stranded inside Fukushima plant . Anti-nuclear activists celebrated following the Fukui District Court's decision in their favor Tuesday. The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster. It said in a statement that \"scientific and professional findings\" showed that the safety of the reactors was assured. But the court ruled that the new safety standards were \"loose,\" lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said. The power company said it would appeal the decision. \"We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and cannot accept it at all,\" it said in a statement. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the \"world's strictest\" safety standards. The government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart, he said. Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations. Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court.

We live in different states and under different circumstances. One of us is a college student, born into a political family, while the other is a former congressman from South Carolina and father of five children. One of us served on the selection committee for the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. The other will receive this award in recognition of the stand he took when he broke with his party and sacrificed his political career to support responsible action to combat climate change. We share an unwavering belief that the United States must lead the world on climate change and seize opportunities for unity, growth and progress. We believe that President Kennedy's courageous leadership in space exploration holds lessons that can help guide us forward. In 1962, President Kennedy, speaking at Rice University, described the space program that he had first announced when he asked the Congress to support his ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Opening his speech, Kennedy stated simply the effect of man's scientific pursuit:  \"The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.\" This curious paradox holds true today. Our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded. Many of our elected representatives persist in inaction and complacency by arguing that individual nations are powerless to solve the problem because every nation is culpable. Others choose to dispute the science, deny the evidence, and avoid the question of how to solve the problem. But climate change is only scary if we choose to sit, wait and do nothing about it. President Kennedy encountered the same dilemma:  \"It is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But ... this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.\" We need not be frightened today. Climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of American triumph and human progress. It is a moment for this generation to display the very qualities we attribute to the American political heroes of earlier times, who left the world a better place for us. Courage of this scale will come from a people who are told that they can do great things by leaders who believe that their people are capable of great things.  We believe that America will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on Earth from travel in space. Kennedy told the crowd at Rice that the pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible was valuable precisely because it would be so hard to accomplish. \"We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard,\" he said. Something so difficult would only be achieved through cooperation and national unity, and it would push us toward greatness. There will always be reasons for inaction. Many will argue that responsible reforms will hurt our economy as it recovers from the Great Recession. They will exploit the fears of that time to justify extracting rents from industries and fuels whose days are numbered. Progress on climate change will require courage. Some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall, but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy, more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet. We can start by making straightforward changes in the tax code that are acceptable to both the right and the left. By adopting policies that would make it in our trading partners' interest to join us, meaningful reforms can provide solutions without making government any bigger. As Americans, we are obligated to leave the world a better place than we found it. We believe, just as President Kennedy did, that only if America leads on the most important issues of our time can we deliver on that promise. We call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again."}

And Sabeen Mahmud surrounded herself there with books, people, and discussions on technology, human rights and women's entrepreneurship. Introducing others to Jimi Hendrix, street art, and talking politics was not supposed to get her killed. But in Pakistan, free speech is dangerous, and Mahmud's exuberant exercise of it made her stick out nationwide. Two gunman shot her dead at point-blank range late Friday after she locked up The Second Floor cafe in Karachi for the night, police said. Mahmud died from five bullet wounds. The gunmen also shot her mother. She is in a hospital but is expected to be released on time for her daughter's funeral. Mahmud's killing broke hearts beating for non-violence and progressive values across the country. She freely said what she thought in a place where many people are too afraid to and by doing so spoke for many more people than just herself. She had become a Pakistani figurehead for humanism, love and tolerance. \"She took that torch into the dark forest and so many people followed. She really, truly was a success story of the heart,\" said close friend and BBC journalist Ziad Zafar. No one has claimed responsibility for her shooting, and police have not named any motive. But Mahmud had just finished leading a discussion group on a topic that many want silenced, when the shots fell. In the province of Baluchistan, where separatists have fought a virulent insurgency for years, people have been disappearing regularly. There have been steady allegations of mass abduction. The Lahore University of Management Sciences planned to host the discussion on the topic, with human rights activist Mama Qadeer Baloch, but authorities shut it down. Mahmud would not hear of it not going on. \"Despite the plurality of opinion, very little space seems to be given to the discussion in Pakistani mainstream media or academia; the debate seems to be shut down before it can even begin,\" she posted on Facebook. \"What is the reality? Has the media been silenced on Balochistan? What makes it dangerous for us to talk about Pakistan's largest province at one of our most celebrated universities?\" She invited the discussion to The Second Floor, also known by the shorthand T2F.  She said she knew it was a potentially dangerous move, and she had received death threats in the past when she handled the topic before. \"She was the bravest woman in the world, she really was, she was a brave heart; my God, she was a brave, brave girl,\" Zafar said. Even in its secluded, humble location, T2F was a magnet to those seeking secular wisdom. They found it in a homey setting, musingly decorated like a small town college bookstore. The walls outside its entrance are sprayed with socially critical graffiti -- dusky red hearts float across gray walls. Mahmud waited to greet visitors, many of them young Pakistanis seeking freedom of thought, with a hug, a mug and encouragement for Pakistan's future. \"She hoped the same thing we all hoped for, a place that is fair with liberty and justice for all,\" Zafar said. Grief over her death and gratefulness for her work poured out on social media and via email. \"Thanks for giving us the room to breathe when fog pressed heavy on our shoulders. It's only been a few hours, Sabeen, and the city is already gasping for air,\" a group of illustrators called From Karachi with Love wrote. An artist drew Mahmud puttering off on a Vespa scooter wearing pants, a blouse and sandals. Her tightly coiffed short hair and angular glasses framed her bright-eyed features. Missing was a head scarf. On a wall in T2F is a spray painted Technicolor image of Marilyn Monroe from \"the Seven Year Itch,\" her white dress replaced by a traditional outfit of mustard, ocher and  green. But it still flew up over her hips, revealing her alabaster legs, a daringly sexy and satirical image. The artistic expression sticks out and triggers passions, like many things Mahmud said and did."}

His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government \"carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones.\" \"Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,\" Gentiloni said. \"The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists.\" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his \"deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others.\" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became \"another person\" after her son's kidnapping. \"Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,\" a neighbor said.

Real estate in London's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. \"The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money,\" explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. \"They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance,\" she continues. \"It's bringing to London the best of the continent.\" These investors are having a considerable impact on London's property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. \"The new international African is very well-traveled,\" explains Nkontchou. \"Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean.\" 'Safe-Haven' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby's says that foreign investors see London as a \"safe haven\"  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it's here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. \"West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children,\" says Nkontchou. \"Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London.\" Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. \"Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth,\" says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. \"African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. They have the resources and desire to purchase or rental luxury homes in Prime Central London,\" he adds. \"It is going to be the African century.\"More from Marketplace Africa .

Earthquakes are a fact of life in the South Asian country, with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year, geologist and science journalist Kate Ravilious said. With the last major earthquake in 1934, the concern was not if, but when the next \"great\" earthquake would hit, said Ravilious, author of the 2014 article, \"Kathmandu's earthquake nightmare.\" In a landlocked country like Nepal, where infrastructure is fragile to begin with, the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be \"much more serious,\" Ravilious told CNN. Those fears were realized when a magnitude-7.8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of Kathmandu rocked Nepal, toppling homes, historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead, authorities said. \"This event, while large and tragic, is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from Tibet almost to Caspian Sea is an area of major collision between continental plates,\" said geological engineer Nicholas Sitar with the University of California, Berkeley's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. What's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of Kathmandu, which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes. \"The population has exploded in several decades,\" U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Gavin Hayes told CNN. \"When you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that isn't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size, that's when you see the scale of disaster we're seeing now.\" The big unknown is what happens next, now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed, Ravilious said. How will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country, whose single international airport is closed? How will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed? If and when landslides start, how will mountainside villages in the Himalayan range fare? And, will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts? \"The worry now is to get Nepal up and running again on feet,\" Ravilious said. \"The monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we don't sort things out before then.\" An earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake. Nepal is located on a major plate boundary between India and Eurasia, where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years. Those collisions are responsible for the construction of the Himalayas, which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world, said Chris Goldfinger, director of Oregon State University's Active Tectonics and Seafloor Mapping Laboratory. India is moving northward into Eurasia at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year, with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the Himalaya every 500 to 1,000 years, said Marin K. Clark, associate professor of Geological Sciences with the University of Michigan's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The last major earthquake to affect this part of the Himalayas was in the 1500s, and Kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of Saturday's quake in 1934. A major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking, Clark said. The entire area that experienced shaking was in steep, mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard. Clark compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, China. The magnitude-7.9  earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides, many of which blocked roads, slowing response and recovery efforts. The landslides also blocked river valleys, which created significant flood hazard. \"We might anticipate a similar situation for Nepal.\""}

Paparazzi have been stalking the former Olympic champion for months, breathlessly documenting his increasingly feminine appearance down to his lip gloss, pierced ears and French manicure. The social media reaction?  A cheer, a shrug -- and not much else. Except the occasional prod at Jenner also being Republican. Of course, Jenner's family owned the moment, being the reality TV mavens they are -- the Jenners and the Kardashians. \"So very proud of you, my hero,\" tweeted daughter Kendall Jenner. His other daughter Kylie Jenner expressed mixed emotions. \"Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but ... this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,\" she said on Twitter. Ex-wife Kris Jenner was equally supportive. \"Not only was I able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children, I am now able to call him my hero,\" she said. Stepdaughters Kim, Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian also joined the family chorus. \"Love is the courage to live the truest, best version of yourself. Bruce is love. I love you Bruce. #ProudDaughter,\" Kim tweeted. \"Just finished watching the #BruceJennerInterview with the family. Bruzer, I'm soooo proud of you! Dads really are heros ❤️,\" Khloé said on Twitter. \"Couldn't be a more proud daughter. With courage and bravery, let's change the world. I am honored to stand by Bruce's side and support him,\" Kourtney said. The entertainment industry was quick to embrace the news. Lady Gaga has long supported lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. \"We have the chance to write this moment in history together,\" she tweeted.  \"Let's empower people like Bruce all over the world by being loving & not mean.💗\" Transgender actress Laverne Cox of \"Orange is the New Black\" gave a shout out. \"Sending lots of love and support to #BruceJenner and their family tonight,\" she tweeted.  \"It is always brave to stand in one's truth. Congrats darling.\" The Jenner interview was a key moment for advocacy groups like GLAAD and  the National Center for Transgender Equality, thrusting LGBT issues into the spotlight. \"Today, millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender,\" GLAAD tweeted. \"Welcome, #BruceJenner,\" Trans Equality tweeted.  \"Thank you for your courage and bravery.\" As with all things, public opinion is hardly unanimous and social media only represents the views of those who post. Still, there were few detractors. One man used an Old Testament Bible verse as the basis for his stance. \"GOP Logic: Bruce Jenner is not Gay...but Transgender,\" Benny said on Twitter.  \"Still forbidden by the Bible but we cherrypick.\" This woman wasn't sure what to make of Jenner's announcement. \"Still confused about Bruce Jenner becoming a woman...,\" tweeted HugHey. And what would a social media event be without a good dose of humor. Many folks seemed to be more intrigued by Jenner's announcement that he's Republican than him coming out as a woman. \"I accept that Bruce Jenner is a Republican and wish him happiness, even if I can't understand it,\" said Johnny McNulty. \"I'll accept Bruce Jenner's choice to live how he wants much easier than leftists will accept his politics,\" CounterMoonbat said on twitter. And this final nugget from Bibi. \"Bruce Jenner: *comes out as a woman* . \"Everyone: \"Yas girl, slay\" \"Bruce Jenner: *comes out as a republican* . Everyone: \"disgusting\""}

Read week one and week two. When I started this project, my brother texted me, \"Wait until you get to Lot.\" By Sunday afternoon, I understood what he meant. I am horrified by the story of Lot in Genesis. Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was new to me. I actually hadn't put two and two together that Sodom is the origin of the word sodomy. (Feel free to call me dense as you read this). Lot is the central character in the grim story of Sodom and Gomorrah's demise in Chapter 19. You are introduced to the city by Abraham who tries to save the town. In the preceding chapter, Abraham asks God to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town, God won't smite it. God agrees. Lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town. The men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for \"intimacies.\" Ahem. Yeah. Hospitable bunch, huh? Those \"intimacies,\" we are meant to understand, account for Sodom's wickedness. And I guess meant that the town was doomed. (\"Intimacies\" is the term used in my 1991 edition of the New American Bible. The revised edition refers to \"sexual relations.\") To protect the emissaries from the mob, Lot offers up his virginal daughters. Which. Ugh. Anyway, it doesn't work. There apparently aren't enough good men to save Sodom, which leads to God destroying yet another population in Genesis. Oh, and while Lot's chosen family members flee the destruction, Lot's wife turns around and is turned to salt. She had been warned not to look back. After God destroys Sodom, Lot's daughters worry that there aren't any men left, so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him. They need to have children to keep the human race going, the logic goes, I guess. After reading that section, I put my Bible down. I couldn't read anymore. Then I read it again. What was I reading? What are the morals, the meaning, I'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories? This is not the God that I have known for nearly 42 years. It's not the version of the God I pray to daily. I truly don't believe in a God that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality. Why are they wicked? I don't believe that my God that would go after one group -- any group. The God that I pray to doesn't punish the \"wicked\" like this. I can't comprehend this version of God. I can't believe in that kind of God. There were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that I read. But, I want to be truthful with you, my readers. The Lot story struck me -- hard. I wish that I had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago. But I don't. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children. Or it could be a morality tale for the times. The truth is: I don't really know. I just know that my faith doesn't include the idea of such a punitive God. I now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the Bible. And when I read this rough draft to my brother, he said to me, \"You have just hit the tip of the iceberg.\" So, I will continue reading."}

The report by the TSA's Aviation Security Advisory Committee said that full employee screening would not \"appreciably increase the overall system-wide protection.\" Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. Full physical screening of employees also \"is incapable of determining a person's motivations, attitudes and capabilities to cause harm, among other limitations.\" \"No single measure can provide broad-spectrum protection against risks or adversaries,\" the report said. \"Therefore, risk-based, multi-layered security offers the greatest ability to mitigate risks through the application of flexible and unpredictable measures to protect commercial aviation.\" The TSA and most airports could not afford 100% employee screening, the report said. Only two major airports in the U.S. -- Miami and Orlando -- require employees to be screened through metal detectors, a CNN investigation found earlier this year. As a result of the report, TSA Secretary Jeh Johnson announced immediate actions, including criminal background checks every two years for all airport aviation workers, screening of airline and airport employees traveling as passengers, reduction of access points to secure areas at all airports and increased random screening of aviation employees. Johnson requested the TSA study after a Delta Air Lines ramp worker and passenger at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were arrested in December for allegedly smuggling guns onto flights to New York. Since the incident, the airport has hired private security to check the bags of employees when they show up for work and has increased overall security. \"Immediately following the incident in December 2014, TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,\" Johnson said in a statement. Sen. Charles Schumer called Johnson's announcement \"a prompt response and a significant first step to closing the gaping loopholes in airport security, especially with regard to reducing access points and enhancing criminal background checks.\" Specifically, the TSA report said employee vetting should be strengthened by \"updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses, instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and DHS data sources, and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause.\" In addition, the TSA should expand the collection of domestic intelligence, which would include monitoring social media, and expand national reward programs to encourage employees to report security issues, the report said. \"Although there is no perfect security system, the multiple layers -- which can be routinely enhanced or modified -- provide an effective means to secure passengers, employees and facilities,\" the report said. It also recommended increased surveillance of employees who work inside baggage rooms and cargo areas. CNN revealed this month that passengers filed 30,621 claims from 2010 to 2014 for valuables that were missing from luggage. The TSA report agreed with a 2008 Homeland Security study that found random screening was more cost-effective than mandatory airport employee screening. The committee that conducted the TSA study consisted of representatives from the TSA, airports, airlines, airline pilots, aviation security and law enforcement. Rep. John Katko, R-New York and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security, said, \"As threats to aviation security continue to evolve, it is critical that the Transportation Security Administration, as well as the airport community, are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats. I look forward to having a meaningful dialogue with airport stakeholders and the TSA on what can be done, going forward, to improve employee vetting and screening for those with access to sensitive and sterile parts of airports.\" Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-New York, a ranking member of the Transportation Security Committee, said the report makes it clear that the \"TSA must do more to neutralize the insider threat and prevent security breaches like we saw in December.\" \"Screening every single employee may not be a cure-all solution, but every single employee should come to work every day with reason to expect that they'll face random screening and inspections,\" she said. Lauren Stover, security director at Miami International Airport, told CNN, \"We support the findings of the committee and agree that there is no single solution in mitigating the insider threat, however we will continue our employee screening program as we believe that physical screening is a critical component to a layered security program.\" CNN's Curt Devine contributed to this report."}

It may be longer. In other words, there will be no execution less than 72 hours after notification,\" Tony Spontana told CNN by phone Sunday. Though Indonesian officials said all 10 would be executed at the same time, Spontana said French national Serge Atlaoui had filed a challenge to the State Administrative Court on Thursday so his sentence has been delayed. Meanwhile, Edre Olalia, a lawyer acting for Philippines maid Mary Jane Veloso, told CNN Sunday that Veloso had telephoned her sister on Saturday at about 5:30 p.m. local time and said her execution will take place on Tuesday, April 28.  Officials at the Philippines Embassy in Jakarta confirmed the same information. According to her lawyers, Veloso unknowingly carried drugs into Indonesia, and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate. On Friday, Indonesian officials advised relevant consular officials to travel to Indonesia's \"execution island\" -- Nusa Kambangan -- where the ten are being held -- a sign that the sentences may be carried out soon. They will face a firing squad. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . The ten on death row, which also include two Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran -- members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring -- as well as prisoners from Ghana, Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia, had their petitions for clemency denied by President Joko Widodo in late 2014. A statement Sunday from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian government had been notified that the execution of Chan and Sukumaran would be carried out \"imminently.\" \"I spoke to Mr. Sukumaran's mother Raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from Indonesian President Widodo for both men. \"They have been rehabilitated in a most remarkable way over the past ten years and are genuinely remorseful for their serious crimes. \"Nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young Australians are executed. \"I again respectfully call on the President of Indonesia to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency. It is not too late for a change of heart.\" The two Australians, convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot, tried to challenge the President's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the State Administrative Court to hear their case. Their lawyers have since filed another review at the Constitutional Court. The Attorney General's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options. Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. On Saturday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Indonesia's government to reverse their decision. \"The Secretary-General appeals to the government of Indonesia to refrain from carrying out the execution, as announced, of 10 prisoners on death row for alleged drug-related crimes,\" a spokesman for Ban said, according to various reports. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch says President Widodo \"has an important opportunity to signal Indonesia's rejection of the death penalty by sparing the lives of the 10 people facing looming execution.\" \"Widodo can demonstrate true leadership by ending capital punishment as unacceptable state brutality,\" said Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement Saturday. \"President Widodo should recognize that the death penalty is not a crime deterrent but an unjustifiable and barbaric punishment. Widodo should promote Indonesia as a rights-respecting democracy by joining the countries that have abolished capital punishment.\""}

By the rows of names, red dots are marked to signify the dead. In the past few days, news -- from the network of friends and family across the world -- came in that 20 new dots needed to be scratched in -- for the 20 friends who'd drowned off the shores of Italy. For 25 years, Ali Addeh refugee camp has been a holding point for those fleeing into Djibouti, which borders Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. For the camp's 10,000 residents, who mostly come from these countries, this is supposed to be just the first stop on their journey to resettlement through the United Nations. Many though say it's been years and they're tired of waiting. For those willing to pay, there's another route to a new life. Across the Ethiopian border, through to Sudan and then up and across into Libya -- from where the migrant ships operated by human traffickers set sail at high tide. Henol's friend Soloman was among the hundreds who lost their lives this week when their boat capsized in the Mediterranean en route to Europe, he tells me. They'd grown up together -- even made the risky journey to Djibouti together. When the time came for Soloman to travel, Henol says he was asked to go too but said no. He hoped to give the legal route a little longer. It was the first time they'd been separated in years. I ask Henol if he still believes in the legal route. \"I can see now that we've been forgotten by the world,\" he says.  \"There is no solution here. No solution back home -- what can we do? We are living in limbo.\" He tells me he now plans to follow his friend. Even though he died trying, I ask? \"Yes,\" he replies. Eritrea is ranked as one of the most repressive countries in the world, with an aging dictator enforcing a brutal regime of forced conscription to the army that rights groups believe is a cover for mass exploitation. Elected by the country's national assembly in 1993, Isaias Afewerki runs what is essentially a one-party state. One young man at the camp comes over on crutches to show us his disfigured knee. The commander of his military unit, he says, accused him of insubordination and with a viscous kick left him disabled for life -- just a few months shy of his 17th birthday. He asks that we not reveal his name. These are the things no one here will talk about on camera. Back in Djibouti we find a man who is willing to speak, as long as we obscure his identity. With his face in shadow he haltingly tells us that the last time he saw his father was 20 years ago -- the night his mother was killed trying to stop the men who came to take him away. He believes they were working for the security forces. As soon as he was old enough, he says he made his first attempt at crossing into Djibouti. He was discovered and wounded by gunfire. As soon as he'd recovered though, he tried again, knowing that if he was caught this time he'd be killed. Despite a wound that had barely healed, he made it into Djibouti after four days of walking day and night. This is where he's been for the last seven years, waiting to be resettled through the UN. The uncertainty is agony. He understands why others have pinned their hopes on people smugglers and leaky vessels. \"People risk their lives,\" he says, \"for a better life. \"All this that is happening [in Europe] is because of the neglect of the international community. \"People come to Djibouti and look at someone like me who's been waiting so long and think there is no hope. It's better to put ourselves in the hands of God.\" If he had the money, he says, he would too."}

Blue tarps were visible from the sky for people to hide under -- signs that there was something wrong. We had to circle the airport for a couple of hours. There were a couple of issues. There was an aftershock this afternoon, so they were checking the runway for damage. Military and aid flights have priority, and a few military planes -- Indian military planes -- were going in, trying to bring in aid. Whether they did is unclear. When we landed at the airport, it was wet and cold. A couple of thousand people were lining the road to the entrance to the airport trying to get out. But there's no way to get out, really. There were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours, and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago, no one wants to go inside. The residents of Kathmandu sure don't. You can see some structural damage to buildings. Most buildings are not up to high construction standards. Fallen: Nepal's historic landmarks . Driving through the city, there's not a huge amount of visible damage. There's some damage to houses and buildings, but it's not as visual as the Haiti earthquake (of 2010). We were able to drive the main road to the hotel we're staying at, but they're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks. The guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn. People are squeezed in. There are probably about 100 people in there. The tents are covered, but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water, especially around the edges of the tent. So people are outside in the rain with no shelter. It's visually stark, with people in the streets. It's colder than usual this time of year. I'm cold and damp. When it's almost May, it's usually much hotter. There's very little power in the city -- no power to speak of, no drinking water. For the residents, it's really bad. Very soon, they will need shelter. Temporary shelters have been put up, but very few -- 16 -- by the government. It looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned. People are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings. Those who survived -- and those who didn't . There are issues with fuel in the city, and driving in, all the stores were shuttered. You occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water, but for the most part, nothing is being sold in the city. I don't think they're very concerned about looting, and there's no military in the streets, but they will have to get water and food in the city soon. Communal kitchens have been set up for cooking. Not by the government -- people set them up on their own. People are beside themselves in shock. Their biggest concern now is the structures, needing a place for shelter, to hide from the elements and sleep. Food will become the biggest concern in the coming days. Kathmandu isn't the epicenter though. No one's sure what it's like at the epicenter. People haven't been able to get to outlying areas. We haven't been able to corroborate this, but the people we're talking to here say there's damage to the villages outside Kathmandu -- thousands of houses damaged to the north, closer to the epicenter.

How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the \"real Hillary,\" the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she's someone who \"likes to sing 'God Bless America' on New Year's Eve.\") And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives — just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.' ) Dining aside, it's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can't mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her \"Scooby-Doo\" van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start — not entitled to anything — she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it's hard to underestimate the task at hand. It's also hard to figure out whether it's actually going to work. Hillary Clinton — and her experienced campaign team — are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That's usually a good thing when you're running a presidential campaign. But when you're sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume — unprompted — it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words — as \"standing up for our country.\" Short shrift, it seems to me.) Maybe it's that the old lessons of message discipline don't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create — at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you're having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it's probably not. It's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters -- 53% --  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there's this balance: If you're too much like them, you're nothing special to vote for. But if you're too different, you're not relatable. It's a balance that doesn't come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she's not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  \"Message: I care.\" Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: \"I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do.\" He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary's case, at least trying to make history."}

The journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor's political beliefs and \"dark periods\" of addiction and jail time. Twitter, of course, is abuzz: Did journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy go too far? Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he'd like? From the start of the 7-minute television interview, it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there, even if being there was, ultimately, a benefit to him -- after all, he's promoting his latest film, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" He grows increasingly agitated, even as the line of questioning remains on-topic; his attitude, meanwhile, grew increasingly smug. His eyes glaze over as the reporter talks, he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he's much smarter than Guru-Murthy, and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say, \"Do I really have to sit here with this guy?\" At one point, he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous, saying, \"Your foot is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.\" But it's after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is \"free from all of that,\" referring to Downey's history of \"taking drugs, drinking\" that the building tension comes to a head. \"I'm sorry,\" says Downey, \"What are we doing?\" To which Guru-Murthy replies, \"I'm just asking questions,\" which indeed was so. Downey has the right to refuse to answer the question, of course, but that's not what he does next. Instead, he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum: He smiles arrogantly, says \"bye!\" and stands up to leave. He sure showed him! It's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they're dating, what they're eating, where they vacation, what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago. Journalists often go too far, even if it's their job. And certainly not every journalist is good at his job. But while Downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past, questions that have been asked before, his business is our business. The entertainment industry is about entertaining people. As such, we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched. This is why most celebrities, especially those with a big budget movie to promote, agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general. But when the recognition no longer serves them? Then they want to bemoan it? What Downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions. That's what an interview is. He certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate, or even ones he simply doesn't feel like answering. But he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude, demeaning, and disrespectful -- even if he's a celebrity, and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off. What the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak. After he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves, the actor cannot resist a parting shot. He turns to the reporter, being sure to look directly at the camera on the way, and says, \"You seem okay. It's just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here,\" followed by what sounds like, \"and you're kind of a schmuck.\" Downey might not have been \"in the mood\" to be questioned... and those days, those moods, are understandable. We all have them. And yet in this case, that's, well, too bad. The actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job. He has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being. Given the terms, he is not entitled to call all the shots. That he thinks he can is perhaps our own, celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous; is it any surprise when they reveal that they, too, regard themselves as better than everyone else? But it's still on him."}

Residents in this remote village, about a 44km drive from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, stand on the distinctive steeply terraced hillsides and wave furiously as the relief flight passes overhead. The mission, a joint effort between Indian air crew and a Nepalese army medical team, is only the third operation of its kind to reach the village since Saturday's massive 7.8-magnitude quake, which left more than 5,000 people dead. The aircraft is stuffed to capacity with tents, medicines and packages of tinned tuna, instant noodles and rice, all bundled haphazardly aboard the Mi-17 by soldiers at the air base in Kathmandu barely 15 minutes earlier. Local official Upendra Tamang is there to greet the helicopter as it touches down on a field in front of the village medical clinic, and waiting soldiers swing into action to unload the delivery. He says people have been desperately awaiting the supplies. The situation in Melamchi and the surrounding villages is \"dire,\" he tells CNN through a translator. According to Nepal's National Emergency Operation Center, 1,376 people were killed in Sindhupalchok District, where Melamchi is located, when the earthquake hit. Some 18,000 houses were destroyed and 100,000 people have been displaced in the surrounding area, says Tamang. \"Everyone is sleeping outside,\" he says. He has serious concerns about food supplies in the region, saying the piled boxes of rice and noodles aren't nearly enough to meet the needs of local people. \"Aid agencies need to do something very quickly,\" he says. In the days since the quake, injured people from the region have been told to find their way to Melamchi so they can be picked up by the relief flights, he says. They've sent about 500 of the most seriously injured people for treatment in Kathmandu already -- the majority by road -- but many more are stuck in a local clinic waiting for help. Seven of them, five women and two men, are suddenly driven onto the airfield in a truck and on the back of a pickup. Their injuries are not life-threatening, but they look to be in a bad state: bloodied, exhausted and traumatized. An elderly woman's face is covered in bandages that look like they haven't been changed in days. Another cries in pain as she is loaded on to a stretcher from the back of the pickup, then awkwardly hoisted on to the helicopter. Among the injured brought on board the flight is Forshani Tamang, accompanied by her son. He tells CNN their family lives in a village called Bachunde, where nearly all the houses were destroyed. He and other family members carried Forshani for four hours to reach Melamchi. With their home destroyed and their stores of grain lost, the family are in crisis. As the helicopter takes off for the capital, flying over a landscape dotted with collapsed buildings and bright orange tents, Nepalese army doctor Naveen Tiwari offers perhaps the only positive for those on board. The patients' injuries are mostly lacerations of varying degrees, he says. Their vital signs are all stable, and with antibiotics and intravenous drips, they should recover. When the helicopter touches down at Kathmandu airbase, the patients are swiftly unloaded and unceremoniously laid out on the tarmac in the emergency triage area in front of an aircraft hangar, and paramedics scramble to administer IV drips to those in need . As Forshani's son feeds her a cracker softened with water, the relief team turn to prepare for another mission.

Baxter had come under fire from some community leaders for giving prison sentences to eight teachers and administrators who stood trial and were convicted of racketeering. They'd been accused of taking part in an effort to raise tests scores at struggling schools by erasing wrong answers and putting in correct answers. Outside of court, Benjamin Davis, the lawyer for Cotman, questioned the judge's rationale in handing down heavy sentences a few weeks ago. \"I had never seen a judge conduct himself in that way,\" he said. \"What was going on with Judge Baxter?\" Davis-Williams said she was pleased judge Baxter changed his mind. Her attorney, Teresa Mann, added, \"We are happy. We are elated that judge Baxter took the opportunity to reflect.\" Cotman, Davis-Williams and Pitts, all school reform team executive directors, got the harshest sentences during an April 14 hearing: Seven years in prison, 13 years of probation and $25,000 fines. Baxter said of his change of mind: \"I'm going to put myself out to pasture in the not-too-distant future and I want to be out in the pasture without any regrets.\" During the earlier sentencing hearing, Baxter was frustrated when defendants didn't admit their guilt. \"Everybody knew cheating was going on and your client promoted it,\" Baxter said to an attorney representing Davis-Williams. At one point he said, \"These stories are incredible. These kids can't read.\" At a press conference held April 17, most of the convicted educators insisted they were innocent. \"I didn't cheat. I'm not a racketeer,\" said Diane Buckner-Webb, a former elementary teacher. All defendants sentenced to prison have appealed and are out on bond. The lower prison sentences given to other defendants -- ranging from one to two years -- have not been reduced. Prosecutors said the cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide aptitude tests improved greatly, according to a 2013 indictment. The indictment also states that for at least four years, between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered, fabricated or falsely certified. Michael Bowers, a former Georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal, said in 2013 that there were \"cheating parties,\" erasures in and out of classrooms, and teachers were told to make changes to student answers on tests. Bowers said he heard that educators cheated out of pride, to earn bonuses, to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs. Of 35 Atlanta educators indicted in 2013, more than 20 took a plea deal. Twelve educators went on trial six months ago, with 11 convicted and one acquitted on April 1. Of the 11 convicted, two took a deal in which they admitted guilt, waived their right to appeal and received much lighter sentences. One defendant was giving birth during the sentencing phase not been sentenced. On Thursday, Baxter urged the defendants to engage in community service while they're appealing. He said that might lighten the punishment if the convictions are upheld. The judge said he was tired of dealing with the Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal, which he referred to as \"this mess.\" \"I'm ready to move on. So, anyway, adios,\" Baxter said, and ended the hearing."}

The walkout occurred Wednesday on the set of \"The Ridiculous Six\" near Las Vegas, New Mexico, according to the Indian Country Today Media Network. The script called for native women's names such as \"Beaver's Breath\" and \"No Bra\" and an actress portraying an Apache woman to squat and urinate while smoking a peace pipe, ICTMN reported. \"When I began doing this film, I had an uneasy feeling inside of me and I felt so conflicted. ... We talked to the producers about our concerns. They just told us, 'If you guys are so sensitive, you should leave,' \" said Allison Young, a Navajo and one of the actors who left the set. \"Nothing has changed,\" she told ICTMN. \"We are still just Hollywood Indians.\" \"They were being disrespectful,\" added David Hill, a Choctaw actor. \"They were bringing up those same old arguments that Dan Snyder uses in defending the (Washington) Redskins. But let me tell you, our dignity is not for sale.\" Produced by Sandler's Happy Madison Productions as part of a four-picture deal with Netflix, \"The Ridiculous Six\" also stars Will Forte, Taylor Lautner, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Nick Nolte, Luke Wilson and Rob Schneider, among others. The ICTMN describes the movie as a Western spoof on \"The Magnificent Seven,\" the 1960 classic about gunfighters who protect a village from a group of bandits. The movie was co-written by Sandler and is being directed by his frequent collaborator Frank Coraci. Actors playing historical figures include David Spade as General Custer, Blake Shelton as Wyatt Earp and Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, according to the Internet Movie Database. Sandler had not commented publicly on the walkout as of Friday morning, although people were criticizing him in comments posted on his Facebook page. \"Hey Adam, act like an adult for once. Respect others, especially Native Americans,\" wrote one commenter. In a statement sent to CNN and other media outlets, Netflix defended the movie as satire: . \"The movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason: because it is ridiculous. It is a broad satire of Western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of -- but in on -- the joke.\" The Native American actors who spoke to ICTMN weren't laughing, however. One, Loren Anthony, posted a photo to Instagram from the set Monday along with a comment saying, \"Having a good time, great cast, great crew and feeling blessed to be here.\" But by Wednesday, the Navajo actor had become disillusioned and joined others in walking out. He told ICTMN he felt insulted because costumes he and others wore to portray Apache Indians were not authentic. \"We were supposed to be Apache, but it was really stereotypical and we did not look Apache at all. We looked more like Comanche,\" he said. According to ICTMN, a Native American adviser hired to help ensure the movie's cultural authenticity also walked off the set in protest. Hill, the Choctaw actor, seemed to hold out hope that differences between the producers and Native American cast members could be resolved . \"I hope they will listen to us,\" he told ICTMN. \"We understand this is a comedy, we understand this is humor, but we won't tolerate disrespect.\" In photos: A glimpse of life on the reservation ."}

As of today, 70% of those laying down their hard earned cash are convinced the world is on the verge of welcoming a new princess. I suspect different parties are hoping for a girl for different reasons. Based on the so called \"Kate Effect\" and subsequent \"George Effect,\" the great British High Street is no doubt salivating at the prospect of record sales should HRH Princess (fill in the blank) of Cambridge be spotted in one of their outfits. As one headline blared this week, \"Baby girl could be worth $1.5 billion to the country.\" Magazine and newspaper editors are well aware of the dramatic rise in sales when a royal baby hits the cover, especially a little girl. And then there's Disney, which will always appreciate princesses in the zeitgeist, but as with all things relating to the monarchy, there is also a far greater historical significance should a baby girl arrive. There have been 34 Kings and only six Queens over the course of the British Monarchy's thousand-year history, and yet some of the nation's most enlightened times have occurred when a Queen has been on the throne. Elizabeth I led the country through the Golden Age, and Victoria and Elizabeth II -- the two longest reigning monarchs -- both made their mark with perhaps the most illustrious and progressive legacies of all. While it is unlikely this child will ever be crowned, as the daughter of the second-in-line to the throne, her role will be significant. Prince Charles has made no secret of his desire to slim down the monarchy, but in looking at his family's immediate bloodline -- William, Harry and George -- it stands to be a heavily male-dominated one. In an institution viewed by some as archaic and out of touch, it is imperative to have a strong female presence. Princess Anne -- Baby Cambridge's great-aunt -- grew up with three brothers, and was once described as, \"the greatest King the country never had.\" She is patron of more than 200 charitable organizations and carries out some 500 public engagements a year. A noted equestrian, she won two silver medals and a gold at the European Eventing Championships, and was the first member of the royal family to compete at the Olympics. More importantly she has supported her mother throughout her reign, flown the flag for Britain and promoted brand Windsor around the world. As the only girl born to Elizabeth and Philip, she has matched and often surpassed the accomplishments of her brothers. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, also true blood princesses, are not \"working members\" of the royal family and generally only roll out for state and ceremonial occasions. So, yes, it would be nice for the baby to be a girl so that we can all ooh and ah over frilly dresses, fairy wings and ballet shoes (although as a Windsor she's more likely to be mucking out stables and shooting pheasant), but in truth the birth of a girl matters on a far deeper level: the monarchy needs a baby girl to fill the female void of future generations. The 20th century was ushered in by Queen Victoria and the 21st by Queen Elizabeth II. Should George live to eighty-seven he will be the first monarch of the 22nd century, but as I have said before the British monarchy is anything but predictable. If punters are right and William and Kate do announce the birth of a baby girl as the rightful \"spare,\" it's certainly possible that a seventh Queen may ring in the year 2100. In the event the couple welcomes a boy, however, I sincerely hope there won't be a collective groan of disappointment heard around the world -- after all on the few occasions we have seen Prince George he has been a veritable treat. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration regardless of gender, race, religion or indeed status, and as Prince Harry, the world's most eligible bachelor has shown, games of naked billiards can sell magazines too.

The two met in 1979 at a celebrity tennis tournament at the Playboy Mansion, while Jenner was in the process of separating from his first wife. The two married on January 5, 1981, and made Hawaii their home. Their first son, Brandon, was born in 1981, followed by son Brody in 1983. \"The Bruce I knew back then was an easygoing, down-to-earth, casual, romantic, good and loving man. I was extremely happy to have found such a remarkable partner with whom to share my life. I found him to be honorable and, well, just too good to be true. Just too good to be true indeed,\" she wrote. They were a celebrity \"glamour couple\" of the time, appearing regularly on red carpets, hosting charitable fundraisers and traveling the world together for their careers. Jenner's star grew, and was a man that other men aspired to be, and someone women wanted to be with. \"The Bruce I knew back then was unstudied, affable, and seemingly very comfortable in his own skin. So it seemed.\" Thompson said Jenner told her in 1985 that, despite it all, \"he identified as a woman\" and hoped to move forward with the process of becoming a woman.\" Confused and desperate, Thompson suggested therapy to help her understand what he was going through and \"determine if it was something we could overcome or 'fix.'\" \"I was pretty ignorant of the fact that being transgender isn't something that can be overcome, fixed, prayed away, exorcised or obliterated by any other arcane notion,\" she said. He considered traveling out of the country for gender-confirmation surgery and returning to the United States identifying as female, where his children could meet him as \"Aunt Heather.\" They separated after going to therapy for about six months and Jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis. As he started developing breasts, his children began to notice -- a claim that Jenner also made in his interview. Thompson says Jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married Kris Kardashian, mother of Kim, Khloe, Khourtney and Rob Kardashian. Together, the couple had two children, Kendall and Kylie. Thompson said she forgives Jenner for those years. He has already \"been held prisoner in his own flesh\" and hopes that his life will get easier now. In addition to \"world's greatest athlete,\" she hopes people will remember him as \"trailblazer for the civil rights of the transgender community.\""}

In another room, my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and, instead of seeking cover, drifted towards the window. Outside, a brown dust-cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill. I was at my uncle's place in Ramkot, west Kathmandu, some 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) east from my family home. After escaping the building for the safety of open air, my first thought was for news of friends and family. Calls didn't go through but thankfully texts and data did. I heard from everyone except my mother. Worried sick, I foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home. Another tremor -- the first of many to aftershocks that have continued to strike an already traumatized city -- shook the house. I took refuge under the same doorway. The journey towards my family home in Sifal was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart. A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field. A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. A woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots. In Chhauni, an ice cream seller ran double-time with his cart, while his radio relayed the latest. Further ahead, a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed. Across the Bishnumati River, uphill towards Maru, I ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the Kathmandu Durbar Area. It was reduced to rubble. A blood donation camp was said to be buried by the same structure that sheltered it. Locals were searching for survivors, but progress was slow. The Kasthamandap temple had caved in. Temples that sat on impressive staircase-style pyramids were now dust. The western façade of the Basantapur palace had fallen apart and nothing remained of the remained of the nine-story medieval palace nearby. Meanwhile, the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of Jhocchen, Indra Chowk, New Road, and nearby neighborhoods. In Putalisadak, I met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over. He kept wondering out loud whether he could retake the test. The two of us walked through Bagbajar, trying to trace a few acquaintances, and up Dillibajar to Kamalpokhari. A hawker was selling momos -- a Nepalese type of dumpling -- under a seven-story building, while policemen guarded a jailhouse. People gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads, on traffic islands and around metal pulpits, which looked out of range of falling buildings. The aftershocks kept coming. I reached home and found both my parents alive and uninjured. I couldn't believe that our 30-year-old house was still standing. As I walked my cousin to where his parents were, we kept hearing rumors:  \"More quakes forecast by experts for 5 p.m. and midnight.\" As if to confirm, tremors shook us at six and more would follow at 10 p.m. and midnight, with smaller shocks throughout the night. Along the northern boundary of the former royal museum, the wall had collapsed and people had poured out of the Uttar Dhoka neighborhood onto the palace lawn. Green military tents meant for two people were now packed with six and the army was trying hard to accommodate as many as possible. In Thamel, an electricity pole had squashed an abandoned taxi. A few men took turns taking photos with the wrecked car. In Kantipath, a handful of backpackers were discussing where to make camp. Back home, my parents decided against going to the nearby Sifal Chaur football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents. Instead, their tactic was to stay on the ground floor, be awakened by tremors, and then scamper to a corner of our garden that seemed relatively safe. I did not sleep a wink."}

It's not exactly a typical question, but Shreeves, who lives in Atlanta and is the site manager for the nonprofit Keep Atlanta Beautiful, lives what some may consider an atypical lifestyle: She creates almost no waste. The list of things she doesn't use would send shivers up a consumer marketer's spine: No plastic packaging, no new clothing, no metal cans, no cars (and in turn, no gas). The small amount of waste Shreeves does create goes straight into a 32-ounce mason jar that sits three-quarters full right next to her kitchen sink. Its contents include produce stickers, some paper tea bag wrappers and a long, twisted piece of cotton that went around her toes for a recent pedicure. This is all the waste she has collected in nearly half a year. That's right, EVERYTHING. Six month's worth of garbage for Shreeves is similar to what the average person generates in half a day. A Maryland native, Shreeves considered herself an \"Earth advocate\" from a fairly young age. Of her four brothers and sisters, she says she was always the one wading in the creek that passed by her backyard, climbing trees and pushing her family to stop being so wasteful. \"I got them their first recycling bin,\" she said. Shreeves began her journey into zero-waste living two years ago. She had just quit her job working in television and decided to move to Ecuador for a few months. Before she left she resolved to get rid of as much of her stuff as possible. She had read a blog post by a woman who lives a zero waste life in New York called the No Trash Project, and she was inspired. \"The average person throws away a ton of trash a year,\" Shreeves said. \"One single person. For her to go to zero like that, I was just amazed.\" Upon her return from Ecuador, Shreeves decided to take the lifestyle she started before she left to the next level. In April of last year, she officially began to live zero waste. Simplifying her existence wasn't easy. She had to rid herself of old habits. In the first week, she filled up half the mason jar with paper towels after grabbing them to dry her hands, just out of habit. It also took a while to feel comfortable with the funny stares she would get after politely asking food vendors to put her sandwiches and salads into her metal tin instead of paper and plastic containers. But she stayed strong and a year later she is at the point where she composts, makes her own shampoo, toothpaste and even uses reusable feminine products. And yes, she does use toilet paper -- the kind that's quickly biodegradable. The key to making it all work is an enormous amount of preparation. Shreeves packs her bags every day with a cup to drink out of, a metal tin and a reusable fork and knife, a cloth napkin and a couple canvas bags. This allows her to avoid the waste that comes so often with prepared foods. She has also had to stop going to some of her favorite restaurants and coffee shops because they won't provide reusable kitchenware. Shreeves acknowledges that with this lifestyle come certain restrictions; she has learned to make most of her food from scratch to avoid packaging. She also has to put more time into getting places by bike or public transportation. But without a doubt, the rewards for her outweigh the inconveniences. \"The quality of life that I experience as a zero waster far exceeds my life before. It's made me appreciate the things that I do have. I wouldn't want to be in another space,\" she said. To learn more about cutting down on waste, visit Shreeves' blog, fortnegrita.com."}

She recently ate three. Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps. \"My husband, who's the most calm person that I know, called me up and said, 'I'm not quite sure if I should panic,' \" said Courcelle's wife, Michele Parkinson. The 80-pound Doberman, whom her owners describe as \"more goofy than scary,\" had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents. Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own. The couple took her to the MSPCA's Angell Animal Medical Center, a 24-hour emergency and specialty hospital, where a veterinarian performed a 3-hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly. Mocha was a repeat offender: Just last summer, she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine. She had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed, Parkinson said. Fortunately this time, the jewelry remains were still in Mocha's belly and had not made their way into the digestive tract. The X-ray, however, was disturbing. Parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces. \"It just looked like a Christmas tree and I almost threw up,\" Parkinson said. The veterinarian removed \"about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus\" during the endoscopy, and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces, MSPCA spokesman Rob Halpin said. As of Friday, Mocha was no worse for wear. The hospital sees dozens of cases each week of dogs ingesting foreign objects, and is trained to look for the symptoms of blockages -- typically lethargy, not eating and vomiting, Halpin said. They once saw a golden retriever who had stopped eating and found 43 pacifiers in her belly. (Apparently she was taking them from babies at the park.) And there was the 100-pound bull mastiff who ate his owner's brie that was set out for a party -- along with the cheese knife. The night Mocha stayed in the hospital, a nervous Parkinson stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects. She found one article about a Newfoundland whose owner knew something was awry only when he heard an alarm go off from his dog's belly. \"We've taken every imaginable thing that could fit down the gullet of a dog out with surgery,\" Halpin said. \"There's some evolutionary traits that some dogs have that lead them to eat first and think later ... and some of them are so food motivated that anything with a scent could be associated with food, and they go for it.\" Mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics, but nothing like a pile of jewelry, Parkinson said. Her breeder wondered if the dog was acting out of anxiety. That day, Parkinson had left Mocha in a different apartment the couple owns that the dog wasn't as used to. The breeder told Parkinson that Dobermans are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things. \"She had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed,\" Parkinson said. From now on, Parkinson said she will put Mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new. Follow-up X-rays Monday on Mocha showed a few pieces of metal left, \"but they were moving along\" and the vet expected her to pass them naturally. Parkinson said Friday Mocha was \"her playful, energetic, curious Doberman self.\" But now that she thinks of it, the timing of this whole incident is a little suspicious. \"My husband was all excited about the new Apple watch, but couldn't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches,\" she said. \"I am convinced that he and Mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for Apple's new watch.\""}

The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. \"Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said. U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, from Maryland, is the current space station commander. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Presto and Amanda Barnett contributed to this report."}

Ella and her younger sister, Alice, are athletic, loud, curious, wild-haired kids. They grew up watching their mother compete in races and Ella had asked to sign up for her own. Still, as they laid out everything she'd need the next day, Parker, a photographer, could tell she was afraid. \"Why don't we get a picture?\" Parker asked Ella, now 9. \"Show me your strongest face, show me your bravest face, even if you don't feel that way right now.\" As she pulled the image up on her screen, she got chills from her daughter's direct stare. She looked, Parker said, like \"a little badass.\" \"You're going to be totally fine,\" Parker showed her. \"Look at how tough you are.\" The next day, Ella participated in her race, and loved it. Looking back, \"I wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it, sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear, \" said Parker, who lives near Atlanta. \"As a mom, I really wanted to get a good picture of it, too.\" The photo is one of Parker's favorites from her series, \"Strong is the New Pretty.\" It covers the last two years, but evolved from Parker's early days behind a camera, when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition. It seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows, forced smiles and Photoshop-smooth skin. Hers didn't. \"I didn't want to shoot pictures like that. I didn't want girls to think they had to look like that,\" said Parker, whose daughters are now 6 and 9. \"Whoever they were, however they were, was worthy of an image. Whatever they were was good enough.\" So, she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled, muddy, screaming, laughing, jumping in the pool, collecting worms in the creek, barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles. \"I want to capture them before they lose that sense of 'I'm so awesome.' I wanted them to keep that as long as they could,\" Parker said. \"I started to shoot with that in mind, but it was already there.\" The girls pose for an occasional portrait, but most are kid-inspired moments, shaped by childish wonderment and energy. As parents, Parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside, make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass-stained knees and knots in their hair, Parker said. Now, the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own. \"They're just being themselves, and I'm just recording it,\" Parker said. Responses to the images are mostly positive, Parker said, but there's the occasional complaint that she's showing just one type of girl. It's true, Parker said: They're the ones she's raising, the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7. She hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children's lives. More important, she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be. Parker's own kids still surprise her. \"Alice is a beautiful singer. When I hear her sing, it makes me cry,\" Parker said. \"Ella has this amazing, kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win. It's something that I did not teach her. \"Whatever it is, it's OK.\""}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 952, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\""}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 810, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)The latest outbreak of bird flu -- the worst in the U.S. since the 1980s -- is not a likely threat to humans, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. \"The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,\" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. \"We know how to address disease when we find it.\" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus \"low\" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. \"That said, human infections have occurred\" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. \"We are cautiously optimistic\" that it won't spread to humans, but \"we are prepared for the possibility,\" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called \"torticollis\" or \"stargazing\" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA. So the cases should go down over the summer, but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the Fall."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 957, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)In a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in Haiti in 2010, a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on Earth today. The latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9, which would actually makes it about 40% larger than the 7.8 currently being reported. That's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934, which killed around 10,000 people. Unfortunately, it is quite possible the number of dead in Kathmandu could rise to match it. We knew this disaster was coming eventually. Geophysicists have long monitored how fast the Earth's plates are moving, and we know that the entire subcontinent of India is being driven slowly but surely underneath Nepal and Tibet at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year. It's the reason Everest exists. Latest updates on Nepal earthquake . Over millions of years, the squeezing has crushed the Himalayas like a concertina, raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from Pakistan to Burma. Saturday's quake was neither unusual nor unexpected, although it was larger than most. In the 81 years since the 1934 Bihar earthquake, the land mass of India has been pushed about 12 feet into Nepal. Think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under Nepal. The spring is stuck on a broad, rough surface which we call a fault plane (a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground). Fallen: Nepal's historic landmarks . Sometimes, energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically, releasing all that pent-up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area. The bigger the area that slips, and the larger the pent-up energy, the greater the damage. Saturday's slip took place over an area about 1,000 to 2,000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of Kathmandu and Pokhara in one direction, and almost the entire Himalaya mountain width in the other. A part of India slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath Nepal in a matter of seconds. We have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years. Using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey and to universities such as Columbia, we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly. Avalanches hamper Everest rescue efforts . Not just that: we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface. What used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation. In Haiti in 2010, although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than Saturday's, well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around Port-au-Prince by the shaking and its after-effects. Yet despite some differences, the Nepal and Haiti earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching, and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty, rapid increases in population in urban areas, uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes. About 1.45 million people live in  Kathmandu, the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on Saturday. Nepal has a per capita income of around $1,350, only a notch above that of Haiti, and among the lowest in the world. Meeting building codes in new construction, or taking on expensive retrofitting, is way beyond the means of most. To make matters worse, the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves. Studies have long predicted that the Kathmandu area was due a magnitude-8 earthquake, or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude-8.1 earthquake had struck the area. (Fortunately, Saturday's shaking was half that intensity). Still, this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for Nepal as it emerges from a long-running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily. We have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead."}

Lewis Hamilton took victory for the Silver Arrows at the Chinese Grand Prix -- only for his teammate Nico Rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly. The reigning world champion captured his 35th grand prix win with a peerless pole-to-flag win under Shanghai's sunny skies. \"It was great to have a smooth weekend,\" the British racer said before spraying the champagne on the podium. \"The team have done a fantastic job to up our pace and improve after our last race where we struggled a bit.\" F1 championship standings . Hamilton had lost the Malaysia Grand Prix in a strategic battle with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel but it was business as usual in Shanghai. Rosberg came home second for Mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing Italian racers and renew his rivalry with Hamilton. \"It was an important comeback for the team,\" said the 2014 championship runner-up. Ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with Vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015. \"We just wanted to bring the podium back home,\" said Vettel, a four-time world champion with Red Bull Racing. \"It's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good. I feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys.\" Vettel is just 13 points behind Hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of Rosberg, after the first three races of the year. Rosberg unhappy . It was a disheartening weekend for Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season. On Saturday, Hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and Rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio: \"Oh, come on guys!\" Then the German insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader Hamilton and Vettel, both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier. \"Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up,\" Rosberg told the Mercedes pit wall. Mercedes then instructed Hamilton on the team radio: \"OK Lewis we'd like to pick the pace up a little bit.\" Rosberg complained after the race that Hamilton's lackadaisical Sunday driving was holding him up, pushing him back into Vettel's thrall and taking life out of his tyres. \"It's interesting to hear from you Lewis about your pace up front,\" Rosberg said in the post-race media conference. \"That was compromising my race. Driving slowly, that was unnecessary, and meant Sebastian was closer to me. \"It cost me a lot of time ... I'm unhappy about that of course.\" Hamilton responded: \"It's not my job to look after Nico's race. It's my job to bring the car home. \"I didn't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down. If Nico had wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.\" Bahrain . Hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while Rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium. If the German is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge, which went down to the final race in Abu Dhabi, he will need to turn things around soon. Rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just seven day's time. Ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple Mercedes again, as they did on Sepang's sizzling circuit. The Italian team have the horsepower. Vettel finished less than three seconds behind Hamilton in China with Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen fourth. There was also a small feat further down the field as former Ferrari race winner Fernando Alonso finished his first race for the McLaren Honda partnership with 12th place in China. The Spanish double world champion missed the Australian Grand Prix because of a head injury sustained in testing and then retired in Malaysia."}

The as yet not titled eight-part, one-hour series is set to premiere July 26. Jenner, who along with his family has starred in the hit E! reality series \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" recently went public with the fact that he is transgender. Here are a few things we hope the new show will offer: . A closer look at Jenner's current relationship with his former wife . Fans of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" often got to see the sometimes strained relationship between Bruce and his wife Kris. As the Kardashian family matriarch who also manages her kids' careers, Kris butted heads with Bruce over everything from their children to his desire for more privacy. The pair announced they had filed for divorce in September 2014 after some time of living apart. There has been plenty of speculation regarding Kris Jenner's feelings about Bruce's transitioning though she tweeted her support after he made the announcement Friday during an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer. What role he will take in the transgender community . Before he was a realty television star, Jenner was a popular motivational speaker. He is already being hailed for bringing attention to the transgender community. \"Bruce is incredibly courageous and an inspiration, and we are proud to be entrusted with this deeply personal and important story,\" said Jeff Olde, executive vice president of programming and development for E! \"This series will present an unfiltered look as Bruce boldly steps into uncharted territory and is true to himself for the first time.\" According to E! Jennifer Finney Boylan, who is the national co-chair of GLAAD, will serve as a consultant on Jenner's series. \"Orange Is the New Black\" actress Laverne Cox, who is transgender, has also offered Jenner her support. \"I think a lot of people tuned in expecting to see a spectacle, and they tuned in and saw a profoundly nuanced, complicated, beautiful human being,\" Cox told MSNBC's Janet Mock. His relationship with his kids . Jenner is extremely close with his children. He has six biological kids with former wives Chrystie Scott, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner.  He also helped raise Kris Jenner's four children -- Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Kardashian -- from her first marriage. \"Those are the ones I'm concerned with and the only ones I don't -- I can't allow, I can't let myself hurt them,\" Jenner told Sawyer during their interview about his fear in telling his children. Many of his kids appear supportive of his transition and his two youngest, daughter Kendall and Kylie, released the following statement to ABC about their father: \"We love our dad very much as he is an amazing father. We couldn't ask for a better dad. He has the biggest heart and all we want for him is to be happy. If he's happy, we're happy.\" How fans will react . Jenner has long been one of the world's most popular Olympic gold medalists. Viewers of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" often praised him for being so level-headed amidst all the paparazzi-fueled chaos. But with his new series Jenner will be taking center stage and venturing into completely new territory at a time when some still grapple with issues of gender and sexuality. He sounds like he is ready. \"We're going to make a difference in the world with what we're doing, and if the whole Kardashian show gave me a foothold into that world, to be able to go out there and do something good, I got not problem with that,\" Jenner told Sawyer."}

Nevertheless, Google continues to market a smartphone application that lets lawbreakers pinpoint the location of police officers in the field. Google's executives won't even discuss the subject with organizations representing law enforcement. Google's popular real-time traffic app, Waze, uses GPS navigation and crowdsourcing to alert users to traffic jams, automobile accidents, stalled cars, and through its \"traffic cop\" feature, the presence of law enforcement. Most people undoubtedly use Waze's police-finding feature to avoid traffic tickets, but the app poses an enormous risk to deputies and police officers. In the days before he assassinated New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu at point blank range while they sat in their patrol car last December, Ismaaiyl Brinsley is known to have used the Waze application to monitor the movements of police officers. The killer identified the location of police on his own Waze account and even posted screen captures to Instagram. While Google (which acquired Waze in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion) claims the app \"is all about contributing to the 'common good' out there on the road,\" the risks far outweigh the potential benefits. Every day, thousands of police officers and deputies enforce traffic laws, execute arrest and search warrants, investigate domestic violence complaints and perform countless tasks that are needed to keep our neighborhoods safe and remove criminals from the streets. It takes just a couple of clicks on Waze's \"traffic cop\" icon to identify their locations and indicate whether -- in the opinion of the anonymous user -- the officer is \"visible\" or \"invisible.\" At that moment, the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of Waze's 50 million users worldwide. Social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a \"force multiplier\" that lets citizens help police protect our communities. As we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft, however, technology has the potential for evil as well as good. In the case of Waze, we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies, whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe. Google, whose stated mission is \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk. Even the more benign uses of Waze's \"traffic cop\" feature are concerning. In 2013, 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-related automobile accidents. And in 2011, 9,944 people lost their lives in speed-related fatal crashes. Is the highest, best use of Google's geo-mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits? It's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through Google's technology. Perpetrators of domestic violence can use it to find out about the presence of law enforcement in a spouse's neighborhood; gang members, narcotics dealers, even those intent on perpetrating an act of terror, all have access to Waze's \"traffic cop\" feature. Google has built a solid reputation as a good corporate neighbor, tying for first place in a 2013 study by the Reputation Institute measuring companies' reputations for corporate social responsibility. The company makes much of its compliance with legal, moral and ethical obligations as a good corporate neighbor. But when it comes to Waze, Google has gone into a defensive crouch. The company's executives flat out refused to discuss the subject with representatives of the National Sheriffs' Association, an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff's offices across the United States. The refusal of Google's executives to even dignify our concerns by meeting with us offends our conscience. If Google's real objective is the \"common good out there on the road,\" it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers. The goals are not mutually exclusive: we can have both."}

But there's one missing ingredient -- his own car. The 26-year old has his eye on a Volkswagen Tiguan but Shanghai, like many large Chinese cities, rations license plates as it looks for a solution to its gridlocked roads and polluted skies. To register for a license plate auction, prospective car buyers like Li must put down a deposit in exchange for disc containing software they can use to bid online. The auctions take place once a month on a Saturday morning. \"I've been trying for six months with no success,\" Li told CNN. To boost his chances, Li upgraded the speed of his Internet connection from 10 to 50 mbps but to no avail. Each month there are around 10,000 license plates available. At the most recent auction on Saturday, Li said the final price was 80,600 yuan ($13,000) -- around three times the price of a cheap Chinese car and a third of what Li plans to spend on his SUV. It's possible to get a temporary license, but that has to be renewed every month, and Li says he doesn't want to use a huangniu, or middleman, some of whom employ hundreds of bidders to obtain the coveted registration. \"I know people who've been trying for more than a year,\" he said. Another option would be to buy a hybrid vehicle that automatically qualifies for a license plate -- a selling point not lost on the car manufacturers showing their latest models and concepts at the Shanghai Auto Show this week. Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo all launched gasoline-electric hybrids for the Chinese market at the show, while Chinese manufacturer BYD has been an early pioneer of electric and hybrid cars. \"The infrastructure (charging stations) for electric vehicles is not quite there yet but that's the advantage of a hybrid -- you can have both,\" said Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson. But Chinese drivers haven't wholeheartedly embraced the concept. Even though China overtook the United States as the world's largest car market in 2009, sales of electric and hybrid vehicles, while increasing quickly, still lag behind the U.S., where more than 100,000 were sold last year. And it's thought many are sold to local authorities and state industries, which are responding to central government directives. Few Chinese have American-style garages where the vehicles can be charged overnight. Li said he thought it would be inconvenient. \"I don't want a hybrid car. I thought maybe a Tesla but it's too expensive,\" he said, referring to the hyper luxury electric sports car developed by Elon Musk that has seen weak sales in China. For others, the hassles of buying and owning a car have become too much and some affluent city dwellers are spurning cars. Shanghai resident Lei Gu, 35, learned to drive as a student and Microsoft employee in Seattle and loved driving her compact Geo on the open U.S. roads. But when she returned to China nine years ago, she chose not to purchase a car. \"I used to love driving but I don't think I could drive here even if I wanted to. \"Even though we have traffic rules, people don't follow them. I can barely cross the street.\" She's also put off by the congested traffic and the high cost of parking. If Shanghai's extensive subway system doesn't take her where she wants to go, she uses a popular Uber-like taxi app -- or rents a car. She's not alone. A recent report by consultants Bain & Company suggested that even though China's love affair with the car began late, it may already be souring. Of 2,137 people it surveyed, some 40% said cars were losing their appeal as a status symbol. Gu says luxury cars like BMWs and Mercedes are still an important way to \"show face\" among many of her friends. \"If you've been working for 10 years and don't have a car, people might wonder if you have financial problems,\" she said. But she prefers to spend her money on other things like traveling abroad. \"I do care about face but there are other ways to show it.\""}

Gregorio Billikopf lives across Lake Llanquihue from the volcano has been photographing and videotaping the three eruptions and described Thursday's event as spectacular but not as severe as the two prior ones. \"There is still smoke on and off, but nothing so dramatic (as before),\" said Billikopf, a retired university adviser on agricultural issues. \"On a good day I can see about eight volcanoes. \"I understand that the rain that was announced for today would have been a disaster,\" he added. He lives in a rainy part of Chile, which he described as like a Garden of Eden. The explosion produced an extensive plume, but it was also described as smaller than the eruptions on April 22 and April 23, according to CNN Chile. Deputy Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy said about 1,500 people were evacuated, and security measures will continue as \"contingency plans are operating,\" CNN Chile reported Thursday. For the past several days, the geology agency has maintained there was a possibility of a third eruption as part of steadily declining seismic activity in the area. A 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone has been established around the crater, and Chilean authorities have been keeping residents away from that zone. Last week, military and police forces helped evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said then. The seismic event is sure to add to the volume of ash already spewed since the first eruption. Ash spread to Argentina in the second eruption, which occurred a day after the first. Evacuations in the region involved not only people but also animals. The volcanic debris has landed and piled up in some places to a depth of almost 2 feet, the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety said. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. There was no immediate information on the strength of the third eruption, but government officials have said the second, spectacular nighttime eruption was stronger than the first one. Last week in Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- because of fears of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities last week issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Last week, people were being evacuated to Puerto Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the Interior Ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the Río Blanco. The first eruption set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought . The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was in 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996.

All of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market. Koch Industries' recent announcement that it will \"ban the box\" -- i.e., remove from its job applications the check-box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job-seekers with records. \"Ban the box\" doesn't prohibit background checks, it only postpones them until later in the hiring process. It's one item on a menu of fair-chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first, rather than judged solely on past mistakes. These policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job-seekers who need a second chance, and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record. Two generations of the war on drugs, zero tolerance, and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults  with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs, even as the job market has grown steadily. Millions of people are being left behind, and it's taking a toll on our economy: The reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $57-$65 billion in 2008 alone. These criminal justice policies disproportionately impact African-Americans, who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites. The Department of Justice's recent investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, for example, shows the extent to which racism is perpetuated through police departments and the court system. That systemic racial disparity is then repeated throughout the economy, and the community is put at a severe disadvantage in the job market long after individuals have served their time. That's one reason the African-American unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites. In a job market where employers that didn't previously do background checks now make them a routine part of hiring, qualified job-seekers are being screened out of the applicant pools for more and more jobs. Nearly one in three adults in America has an arrest or conviction history that will show up on a routine background check. Companies like Koch, Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent, and that's why they've already banned the box on their job applications. These policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment. So far, 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair-chance hiring policies. Six of those states and the District of Columbia, plus 25 cities and counties, have applied their policies to government contractors or private employers as well. The Obama administration took an important step toward fairer and smarter federal hiring practices last year when it issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against LGBT individuals. Banning the box and other common-sense hiring reforms would build on that progress and on the successful work of governors and the corporate sector. The administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records. Already, more than 200 organizations and prominent individuals have publicly urged the Obama administration to take these practical steps. If Koch Industries -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box, there's no reason why other federal contractors cannot. Now it's time for President Obama to lead the way and embrace fair-chance hiring of people with records."}

He was 73. Sledge died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Stephanie Price of the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office. Sledge died of natural causes, said East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner Dr. William Clark. He had been in hospice care for cancer, Clark added. In a career that started in the 1960s, Sledge had a number of hits, including \"Take Time to Know Her,\" \"Warm and Tender Love\" and \"It Tears Me Up\" among them. But his first and biggest hit, \"When a Man Loves a Woman,\" towered over them all. Over a mournful, slowly rising instrumental track provided by organist Spooner Oldham, drummer Roger Hawkins and guitarist Marlin Greene -- key musicians of what became the Muscle Shoals sound, heard on countless soul records -- Sledge crooned, pleaded and roared his way through the tune. It came directly from the heart: Originally called \"Why Did You Leave Me Baby,\" he'd written it about a former girlfriend, drawing from a tune that he used to sing to himself as a child. \"I hummed it all my life, even when I was picking and chopping cotton in the fields,\" the Alabama-born singer told the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the time, Sledge was working as a hospital orderly, picking up gigs at night with a group called the Esquires Combo. In a fit of generosity, he gave the songwriting credit for \"Woman\" to two of the Esquires, Calvin Lewis and Andrew Wright, who had helped him with a few chords. The song was recorded on February 17, 1966, in Sheffield, Alabama. Atlantic Records picked it up and wanted to redo the slightly out-of-tune horns, but the original version ended up being released. It hit No. 1 on May 28, 1966. \"Southern soul had at last entered the mainstream of pop in the unlikely guise of the ultimate make-out song,\" music historian Peter Guralnick wrote. Producer Jerry Wexler called it \"a holy love hymn.\" Sledge never saw a dime of songwriting royalties. He had some regrets about that, he told Blues and Soul magazine -- the song would have helped provide for his children -- but he accepted it. \"Worst decision I ever made. But I am not at all bitter. I figure if God wanted me to do what I did, and say what I did to tell those guys they could have the song, then I'll leave it that away,\" he told the magazine. \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" became a standard, covered many times -- Michael Bolton took it to No. 1 in 1991 -- and featured on several movie soundtracks. It was even the title of a 1994 film starring Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan. Sledge's version also returned to the charts, hitting the UK top 10 in 1987. Even with his other hits, he said, it all came back to \"When a Man Loves a Woman.\" \"The granddaddy to all of my songs. The boss of all of my songs. I have great respect for that song,\" he told Blues and Soul. \"Always will.\" Sledge was inducted into the Rock Hall in 2005. His death was followed two weeks later by that of another '60s soul legend, Ben E. King, who had an enduring hit in 1961 with \"Stand By Me.\" People we've lost in 2015 .

{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 929, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)A New York jury deliberating the fate of the man charged with the 1979 killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz is struggling to reach a verdict. The little boy's disappearance, more than three decades ago, sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. Deliberations resumed on Thursday, one day after New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ordered the jury to continue efforts to reach a decision on the guilt or innocence of a bodega worker named Pedro Hernandez. On the 10th day of deliberations, the jurors on Wednesday said in a note that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Hernandez confessed to police three years ago, but his lawyers said he made up his account of the crime. Etan Patz's parents have waited more than 35 years for justice, but some have questioned whether that is even possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an \"IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,\" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. \"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,\" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Hernandez is charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly intending to cause the boy's death and for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was immediately rearrested upon leaving jail in 2012 on charges of failing to register as a sex offender, The Associated Press reported. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. \"It awakened America,\" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \"It was the beginning of a missing children's movement.\" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno and Joe Sterling contributed to this report."}

Many people have praised the unemployed, single mother of six for going to the Mondawmin Mall and getting her son away from the escalating violence. Graham told Cooper that she saw her son with a brick in his hand, and she lost control of her emotions and told him to drop it. Wednesday night: Across United States, protests in support of Baltimore demonstrators . \"I did (get emotional). You know, once he threw that rock down I said, 'You weren't brought up like this,' \" Graham said. He's not a perfect child, but he's also not a thug, she said. The 16-year-old boy said he understood that his mother was there looking out for him. \"She didn't want me to get in trouble (with the) law. She didn't want me to be like another Freddie Gray,\" he said, referring to the 25-year-old man who died of a severe spinal injury after being arrested by Baltimore police. Gray's death has sparked daily protests over police brutality. There have also been riots and looting that prompted the city to put a curfew into effect. Graham said her son told her the night before the violence at the mall that something was up. She told him then and the next morning not to go. He swore to her he wouldn't. Her motherly sense kicked in when she heard school had closed early and the mall was shutting down, too. She went to the mall and focused on the teens who were tossing rocks and bricks. There he was, in sweatpants she recognized. They made eye contact. He had a brick in his hand, and that set her off. Wednesday night: Marchers back in the streets of Baltimore . \"I was so angry with him that he had made a decision to do some harm to the police officers,\" she said. She yelled at him to put the brick down. Singleton said he had seen her, but it didn't make sense that his mother would be there. But when he heard her voice, he realized it really was his mom -- and he was in big trouble. Then the camera captured her memorable smackdown. \"It was just World War III from right there,\" he said, showing some humor about the incident. Graham noticed the TV crew but didn't think anything of it. And she didn't care. \"I wasn't there to be recorded. I was there to get my child,\" she said. Tameka Brown, one of Graham's five daughters, told CNN on Tuesday it wasn't that hard for her mom to spot her 16-year-old half-brother. \"She knows her son and picked him out. Even with the mask on, she knew,\" Brown said. Brown said her mother is always looking out for her children. \"She has always been tough and knows where we are at,\" Brown said. Graham said she tries to steer her son away from potential trouble and troublemakers. \"As long as I have breath in my body I will always try to do right by Michael and show him what's going on out in society doesn't have to be you,\" she told CNN. Her son said that once they got home from the mall he understood why she pulled him out of the crowd. \"I was embarrassed a little bit, until she just started talking to me when we got home,\" he said. \"(She was) just telling me she did it because she cared about me. And it wasn't to embarrass me, but because she cared.\" CNN's Elise Miller and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

The USS Independence was scuttled in January 1951 during weapons testing near California's Farallon Islands. Although its location was confirmed by a survey in 2009, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration went looking for it again in March as part of a project to map about 300 wrecks that lie in and around the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. \"After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,\" mission leader James Delgado, the maritime heritage director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, said in a statement. Indeed, sonar images show what looks to be an airplane on one of the elevators that took planes from the Independence's hangar deck to its flight deck. The ship sits upright with a slight list to starboard, according to NOAA. NOAA's survey of the 623-foot-long, 11,000-ton carrier was conducted by the Echo Ranger, an 18.5-foot-long autonomous underwater vehicle provided by the Boeing Co. The Echo Ranger traveled 30 miles from its base in Half Moon Bay, California, and hovered 150 above the carrier, which lies 2,600 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The drone used a three-dimensional sonar system provided by Coda Octopus to get images that showed how well the warship has weathered 64 years in the deep. \"This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the 'greatest generation' that sent not only this ship, but their loved ones to war,\" Delgado said in the statement. In its 20 years in the Navy, the ship played a role in some of the most important events of World War II, earning eight battle stars in the process, and the dawn of the nuclear age. Independence was seriously damaged by Japanese torpedo planes during the Battle of Tarawa in late 1943. The ship returned to California for repairs and made it back across the Pacific by July 1944 to participate in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and the sinking of one of the Japanese Imperial Navy's biggest warships, the battleship Musashi. Later, in the Battle of Cape Engano, planes from the Independence were involved in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers. After the war, Independence became part of a fleet used to measure the effects of atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on July 1, 1946. It sat just 560 yards from ground zero in the first test, a 23-kiloton air blast of a fission bomb similar to the one used over Nagasaki, Japan, a year earlier, according to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Twenty-four days later, Independence was 1,390 yards from the center of a second atomic blast -- also a 23-kiloton device but an underwater detonation. The ship was later brought back to California for nuclear decontamination before being sunk during the weapons training in 1951. NOAA said no signs of radioactive contamination were noted during the survey of the sunken carrier last month. The agency has no plans for further missions to the ship, according to the NOAA statement."}

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are awaiting death by firing squad on Indonesia's \"execution island\" for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot. A panel of three judges in the state administrative court in Jakarta on Monday confirmed an earlier ruling that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear challenges against President Joko Widodo's refusal to grant clemency. Lawyers for the pair had argued that Widodo had failed to individually consider their cases. One of the condemned men's lawyers, Leonard Aritonang, said he was disappointed with the rulings but would respect the court's decision. He said his team would file a further review, asking the Constitutional Court to explain Widodo's obligations regarding granting clemency. \"I'm hoping the government still respects... any ongoing proceedings,\" he said. Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general's office, told CNN that the state administrative court's ruling was \"a relief.\" \"We had predicted it will be rejected because clemency is a prerogative right of the President, as head of the government, not an object of a suit at the administrative court,\" he said in a message. \"With this decision, it's a step closer towards the scheduled execution.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. Indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, Widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January, he said there would be \"no compromise\" on drug dealers. \"Indonesia is in a drug emergency, so we need to have something that's firm,\" said Widodo. \"They can ask for amnesty from the President. ... But I'm telling you there will be no amnesty for drug dealers.\" In December, six prisoners convicted of drug offenses were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Chan and Sukumaran have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, while Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney; he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. Opinion: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said that their rehabilitation is genuine. Australians have shown public support for the men, with politicians and members of the public turning out for a dawn vigil to demonstrate opposition to the planned executions.

Hungarian architect Matyas Gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature. And while that doesn't mean that he can do away with traditional materials like bricks, cement, and plaster, his system promotes a whole new idea of engineering. Gutai built a prototype house in his hometown of Kecskemet, south of Budapest, with his high school friend Milan Berenyi, after years of research and development. The house was built with a grant from the EU, and showcases the \"liquid engineering\" concepts Gutai has written about extensively. Panels, some of steel, and some of glass, make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers, which equalizes the temperature across the building. The house is actually able to reheat itself, when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage, to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops. The indoor temperature can also be modified using a monitoring system similar to central heating. This is a very efficient and sustainable system: the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers, which could reduce carbon emissions. \"Our panel can heat and cool the building itself -- the water inside the panel does the very same job as heating,\" says Gutai. \"It saves energy, when you compare it to a similar building with large glass surfaces -- it's a very clean and sustainable solution.\" While studying sustainable architecture at the University of Tokyo, in 2003, Gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths. Despite the snowfall outside the pool, Gutai remained comfortably warm inside it -- it was then he realized the importance of water's surface temperature and its potential use in architecture. \"As an architect I think it's really important that this building tries to redefine permanence, which has been a key concept in architecture for thousands of years. Our approach to permanence hasn't changed much at all, but now instead of making something very strong that tries to resist everything, we are making something that adapts to its environment. \"Architecture is really changing in our time. We've reached our limits when it comes to solid architecture, now it's reasonable to look for a new system.\" \"This research dates back seven or eight years,\" explains Gutai. \"I started it at the University of Tokyo and it took us almost six years to get the building done. There are plenty of structural problems involved -- a lot of important questions were raised such as what happens if it's so cold outside that the water freezes or what happens when one panel breaks.\" \"We now mix the water with natural solvents, that do not cause pollution but lower the freezing temperature to an acceptable level. This practically means, that even if the reheating technology fails, the water cannot freeze.\" \"In case of cold climates, like in Hungary, we also add some external insulation to the structure, to protect it from freezing.\" And if a panel were to break? \"We designed special joint units. The joint elements allow slow flow, but block faster flows,\" he explains. This means that if one panel breaks, it will be sealed from the remaining ones instantly. This effect is based on fluid dynamics, and not computers or monitoring system -- which minimizes the chance of failure. Gutai has worked in cooperation with universities and manufacturers to make sure the building is viable, and while the prototype house is only a small space (eight square meters in total) it demonstrates the power of this new technology. \"Our goal should be to use less energy and materials, and take cities off-grid as much as possible. The water house is one way to do that,\" said Gutai, who currently works as a researcher at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. Constructing houses in this way is moderately more expensive than traditional designs, but this prototype aims to slash our energy needs and Gutai is working with factories and companies across Europe on projects using this technology. To make water the building material of a greener future."}

True or False, Mercury is: . 1) The planet closest to the sun in our solar system . 2) So hot that water couldn't possibly exist there . 3) Something used in old-style glass thermometers . 4) A planet you don't think about very often . Answers: True, False, True (but not what we're talking about in this story) and I'm guessing No. 4 is true too. If you flunked the test, it might be because Mercury (the planet) suffers from bad (or very little) press. Or, maybe it's just bad lighting. Mercury orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun. Compare that to Earth -- we're about 93 million miles from the sun. Mercury's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight. This may be one reason we don't think about it much. Venus, on the other hand, the planet between Earth and Mercury, appears to be the brightest planet in the sky. It's so bright it's been mistaken for an airplane. Pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking Venus for oncoming plane . But back to Mercury. It's getting some attention from the media now because it's about to get a visitor. The NASA spacecraft MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is about to crash onto Mercury. The probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting Mercury on March 18, 2011. Now, MESSENGER is running out of fuel and NASA says it will hit the planet's surface at 8,750 mph (3.91 kilometers per second) around April 30. You won't be able to see it hit because Messenger will crash on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. There's no way to save the spacecraft, but mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have been doing what they can to delay the inevitable. They've been using the little bit of fuel left on board to maneuver the spacecraft to keep it in orbit. They'll do one final maneuver on Friday, April 24. \"Following this last maneuver, we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant, as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas,\" mission systems engineer Daniel O'Shaughnessy said at a recent media briefing. \"At that point, the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun's gravity.\" But rather than mourn the loss, scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. One of MESSENGER's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. It also took some amazing photos of the planet. So the MESSENGER mission is ending, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And if you want to see Mercury with your own eyes, you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies. It will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.

Terrified foreigners hiding in police stations and stadiums. Machete-wielding attackers hacking immigrants to death in major cities in South Africa. As attacks against foreigners and their businesses rage on, killing at least six people this week, other nations in the continent are scrambling to evacuate their citizens from South Africa.  But this is not the first time xenophobic violence has exploded in a country that  tries to portray itself as a diverse \"rainbow\" nation. They started after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens, local media reported. Shortly after his comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. His office has denied he made the comments, saying  journalists misquoted him. While kings are mostly ceremonial figures in the nation, they are influential in their communities. But the United Nations said the attacks started in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. Some citizens have accused African immigrants of taking their already scarce jobs, undermining businesses owned by locals and contributing to a high crime rate.  The nation's unemployment rate is about 25%, according to government figures. But resentment over porous borders, growing crime rates, poverty and corruption are also a major concern, analysts say. President Jacob Zuma has said his government is addressing the social and economic concerns. But he said immigrants contribute to the nation's economy and bring skills that are in demand, and should not be stereotyped as criminals. \"While some foreign nationals have been arrested for various crimes, it is misleading and wrong to label or regard all foreign nationals as being involved in crime in the country,\" Zuma said. The nation has about 2 million documented and undocumented immigrants, which is about 4% of the total population, according to a study by the University of the Witwatersrand. Zimbabweans make  up the largest  group of immigrants. Also, South Africa is a top travel destination for wealthy Africans because of its proximity and developed infrastructure. Yes. This is the latest in a series of attacks that date back years. In January, looters burned businesses owned by foreigners in another wave of xenophobic attacks. In addition, there were other incidents of violence last year, Human Rights Watch said. Seven years ago, Johannesburg was the epicenter of more anti-immigrant tensions that left dozens dead in attacks that later spread to Cape Town. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In those attacks, police arrested more than 200 people on various charges, including rape, murder, robbery and theft. In 2006, xenophobic violence broke out again for several months in Cape Town. Victims of xenophobic attacks have been from various African nations, including Nigeria, Somalia and Ethiopia. African nations have condemned the attacks. Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe are just a few of the countries evacuating their citizens from South Africa. In Zambia, local radio station QFM said it will not play South African music in solidarity with the victims. And in Mozambique, South African energy and chemical giant Sasol sent about 340 South African nationals home. The company said Mozambican employees voiced concern about reported violence against their nationals and protested the presence of South African employees in Mozambique. Most of the attacks have erupted in poor and marginalized areas. Despite the progress the nation has made since its apartheid days, inequality still remains a major concern, according to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. \"It is up to the present and next generations to take up the cudgels where you (Mandela) have left off. It is up to them, through service to deepen our democracy; entrench and defend our constitution; eradicate poverty; eliminate inequality; fight corruption, and serve always with compassion, respect, integrity and tolerance,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Xenophobia, racism and sexism must be fought with tenacity, wisdom and enlightenment.\" As fears of more attacks grow, South Africans have taken to social media and the streets to protest xenophobia and violence."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 844, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 821, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)North Korea is in the headlines again. According to a Wall Street Journal report Thursday, Chinese nuclear experts have told the United States that Pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story. The key takeaway from the latest assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities. True, the reported Chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear \"arsenal.\" However, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by U.S. and other experts. The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that North Korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and Pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly-enriched weapons-grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the U.S. and members of the Six-Party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial. After all, the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually. This news could be much more serious. Why? For a start, it would mean that North Korea's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition, if it had not already, of a runaway nuclear weapons program, with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in North Korea's mines. In addition, while the plutonium program at Yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile, the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium-based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile, meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in North Korea, undetectable from the sky, but in any large warehouse. Washington and Seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying North Korean threats, at least when there isn't a full-fledged crisis going on. For example, the United States downplayed North Korea's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in December 2012. And up until 2006, no one thought the Kim regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test. These new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat North Korea poses once again. But Thursday's report isn't the only troubling information we have had recently. Just as concerning is the NORAD commander's assessment on North Korea's missile capabilities. On April 7, Adm. Bill Gortney said during a press briefing that the Defense Department believed Pyongyang's KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is operational, with a warhead capacity. This statement is troubling for two reasons. First, Gortney's statement, when combined with the latest Chinese assessment, implies that North Korea now not only has nuclear weapons, but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the U.S. mainland. Second, and just as importantly, Pyongyang's advances in mobile ICBM capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the Korean Peninsula. Put simply, these capabilities could give North Korea confidence that it is immune from any U.S. counterstrikes. And if that ends up being the case, the United States could find itself with a renewed headache in Asia -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling."}

The certificate documents my successful completion of the DC Special Flight Rules Area, or SFRA, online course. The online course verifies that I am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted U.S. airspace in the country. Although a \"no-fly zone\" over the White House has long existed, the SFRA airspace was developed to protect the Washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The size of the SFRA airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it, an opportunity to identify the threat, and if necessary, to divert or eliminate it. An airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of Reagan National Airport. At the 30-mile radius, all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code (a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight). Aircraft must enter the SFRA through specific flight \"gates\" that are displayed on a standard aviation map. Aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans, which include all airline operations, are not required to comply with SFRA restrictions. Air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing. As a matter of standard procedure, flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes, so the authorization for transit through the SFRA airspace is already built into the system. Why do I carry the certificate as an airline pilot? I have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan. Pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why . Noncompliance with the airspace requirements, or worse, no communication at all, carries some serious federal penalties, which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license. Being at the wrong end of an F-16 missile is also a possible penalty. So how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace, as happened Wednesday, when a postal carrier from Florida landed a single-person aircraft on Capitol grounds? Well, I'm making an assumption based on the video footage, but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the FAA as a gyrocopter. A gyrocopter cannot quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter; it requires a short ground run for takeoff. And most gyrocopters are kit-built aircraft. It also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds, which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in FAA parlance. Why is weight significant? Below that weight, a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required. In addition, to remain in the classification, the maximum designed airspeed can't exceed 55 knots. Lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court . A facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average Canadian goose. And the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited. If it was actually tracked on a radar screen, the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds. How much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes? Well, if it had been crashed into a building, I feel confident that the building would have been triumphant. If the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device, the weapon would have had to be relatively small. The engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot. And lack of carry-on space is a definite issue. Not that a review of airspace security measures isn't in order, but I wouldn't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic. As an airline pilot, I can say I am relatively confident that our nation's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics."}

Gone, show organizers hope, will be the scantily-clad \"car babes\" that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event. The focus, instead, will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers, which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for Chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world's largest car market. \"It's a major industry event for us,\" said Andrew Boyle, global product communications manager at Rolls Royce. It sells several hundred of its super-luxury vehicles in China each year, and in Shanghai this week will launch its latest model, the Phantom Limelight. Vehicle sales in China totaled 23.5 million units last year, almost a third more than in the United States. However, the show comes at a turning point for China's auto market, which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade-long sales and production frenzy. Intense competition for China's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to Chinese preferences. Nissan will use Auto Shanghai 2015 to unveil the Lannia mid-size sedan, which it says has been specially created for \"the rising young Chinese generation.\" The country's gearheads have embraced the SUV or sport utility vehicle, sales of which jumped a third last year, and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of European, Japanese U.S., South Korea and Chinese automakers. This year MG, once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, enters the fray with its first SUV, the GS, while Ford will give two new luxury SUVs their China market debut --  the Lincoln MKX and Lincoln Navigator, the latter favored by hip hop stars. \"The SUV is popular as a first car,\" said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company. \"If you only have one, you want one that you can commute in and take on a road trip.\" Foreign brands have dominated sales in the past two years, but as they improve product quality and design, local rivals like Geely, which also owns Sweden's Volvo, and Great Wall Motor are clawing back market share, especially when it comes to SUVs. Geely, which already exports to Russia, the Middle East and Africa, is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets. It is preparing to export the Volvo S60 Inscription to the United States from a factory in the southwestern city of Chengdu. It would be the first car made in China to hit U.S showrooms and may pave the way for Chinese brands to shake up the U.S. market like Japanese and Korean car manufacturers did decades earlier. With car ownership still at much lower levels than the U.S. and Europe, China is likely to remain the industry's most important market for decades. However, the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past. In 2014, growth in sales halved to 7% and according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9%. It comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles, especially brands like Audi that have been the ride of choice for Chinese officials. On top of that, the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers, as is an awareness of the environmental costs. Congested and chaotic roads, restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space  may trigger a backlash against car ownership, according to a recent report from Bain & Company. \"The car was seen as a status symbol,\" says Pierre-Henri Boutot, a partner at Bain and co-author of the report. \"But now in larger cities they see the hassle and some of these people are thinking of giving up their car.\" Just maybe, China will need those car babes to boost sales after all."}

From there, she hoped to cross the Mediterranean Sea so her baby could be born in Europe. She didn't get there. She was arrested as she was sailing north and is now one of 350 migrants being held in a facility just outside Tripoli. Other pregnant women fleeing repression have come to Libya -- many fleeing fighting that refuses to stop. They, like male migrants, are willing to risk their lives on crowded boats to make the final part of the trip. The Somali woman's baby, Sabrine, was born a week after she was detained. Libyan officials are in a quandary. The prison head admitted to CNN there is no system in place to send these people home, jail them or let them go. About one-third of the migrants are from Eritrea on the east coast of Africa. They denied they were heading to Europe and told CNN they just want to go home, which is several thousands of miles away. In one sense, they are fortunate, even though the time in prison seems like forever. They are alive. Many others have died when smugglers' ships sink. Bodies wash up on Libyan beaches. They are anonymous -- no IDs, no links to who they were and what was in their past that drove them to try the dangerous trip. In Malta, there are similar stories of death. On Thursday, the bare, stark caskets came in one by one on the shoulders of Maltese soldiers. The tears soon came along with them. That was the scene in a tent outside the Mater Dei Hospital in Valletta, Malta, a chance for citizens and dignitaries to remember 24 of what's thought to be hundreds of migrants killed when their crammed ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea. Almost all the other victims haven't been accounted for yet, with the presumption that their bodies remain trapped inside the 66-foot (20-meter) boat that capsized late Saturday roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Libya. Italian authorities have said that many of the estimated 850 aboard had been locked in the ship's lower levels with no way out. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories . The tragedy has prompted questions about the growing migrant crisis facing Europe, as well as about who is responsible for Saturday's tragedy. The Catania, Italy, prosecutor's office announced Tuesday that the vessel's 27-year-old captain, Mohammed Ali Malek, and crew member Mahmud Bikhit have been arrested on suspicion of \"reckless shipwreck, multiple manslaughter (and) abetting clandestine immigration\" for their roles in the disaster. Those questions still need to be answered. But Thursday, at least, was a day for reflection -- about lives snuffed out simply because people wanted a better life. \"This event reminds us that we are all immigrants and our life is a journey of migration,\" Imam Mohammed El Sadi said at Thursday's funeral. \"Our grandparents Adam and Eve, peace be onto them, emigrated from heaven to earth. We emigrated from our mothers' wombs to this world, and we will immigrate to the graves.\" The deaths are the latest illustration of the increasing flow of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East through the Mediterranean and into Europe -- assuming they survive the trip. Gemma Parkin, a spokeswoman for Save the Children, said that the number of migrants who have fled to find refuge in Europe has skyrocketed 70% this year over last, a dramatic rise that she attributed mostly to the deteriorating security situation in Libya. About 8% of the recorded migrants between January and April 19 of this year are children, Parkin said. Of those, 70% aren't unaccompanied by adults -- some of them as young as 9 years old. Such numbers represent only people rescued at sea or caught once they reach land. Frontex, the European Union's border management agency, says that many illegal immigrants get through without being detected; moreover, most of them come in legally via airports and then overstay their visas.

After all, this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive. Such moves are part of this murky group's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information. So what can and should we make of the organization? I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night. And although it's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us, I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots, but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular. An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel. That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy, much like communism. But underneath it, much like communism, is simply a drive for control, a lust for power. Next, ISIS presents itself as a global organization, but it has thrived because of a local cause. The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that ISIS will be able to capitalize on this chaos. In the long run, ISIS might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called Caliphate. The few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by ISIS suggest that, unsurprisingly, people do not like living under a brutal, theocratic dictatorship. They live in fear, and even those who chose it as an alternative to Shiite rule are growing disenchanted. In this respect, ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract, but once they are actually governing in their medieval, barbarous manner, the allure fades and the disenchantment builds. The result is ever-increasing repression. Remember, no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere. The group simply slaughters its way to control. Of course, one of the big questions has been: Is ISIS a threat to the West? The group's leaders declare that it is. But their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their Arab enemies, on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They understand, of course, that to be Terror Group No. 1, they must battle the country that is the world's No. 1 power -- the United States. With that in mind, they seek such a confrontation and hope that the United States will come to the Middle East and fight them on their terms, on their terrain. Still, while they are opportunists, and they ask and hope that their followers act in America, their main focus is not to come here -- they want Americans to go there. Yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat ISIS poses, the group has changed the nature of terror. The leaders of ISIS have recognized that above all, they are a messaging machine, which in turn becomes a recruitment machine. This means that the key is not what happens on the ground, but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the Internet. And ISIS does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web. The shock and awe they produce makes them go viral, and thus are seen by tens of millions. That ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims -- who seek revenge, glory and gore. Unfortunately, as long as those young Muslim men, scattered across the globe, are attracted to ISIS and stream to its cause, the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month."}

A police chief supports the police officer, who is ultimately exonerated, and a predominantly black community seethes with rage because it knows that an injustice was done. We've seen this movie before. Spoiler Alert: Cop gets away with it. Routine stops for walking in the middle of the street or driving with a broken taillight -- these should not result in anyone's death. But time and again it ends with a black man dead in the street and the community has no recourse. This time the stage was set in North Charleston, South Carolina, a city of about 100,000 people. Walter Scott was stopped by Officer Michael Slager for a broken taillight, and within minutes Scott was dead. According to the incident report, Slager said: \"Shots fired, and the subject is down. He took my Taser.\" His attorney at the time, David Aylor, said that Slager \"felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.\" But then came the video. We watched in horror as we saw Slager shoot Scott in the back multiple times. Then we saw Slager pick up something from one location and place it near Scott's lifeless body. On Tuesday, the officer was arrested on murder charges. North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters, \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw.\" Apparently so was Slager's attorney, who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer. After the video became public, the officials in North Charleston deftly handled the situation. However, it was an easy case. There is no plausible evidence that Slager feared for his life when Scott is seen running away. In Ferguson, the video we have in the death of Michael Brown is of press conferences with police Chief Tom Jackson, who refused to release the police officer's name, but did release a video that appeared to show Michael Brown stealing cigars. We have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in Ferguson that were trained on its residents and the press. The world seethed. North Charleston's police force is about 80% white, with a population of 47% black and 37% white in the city. Ferguson's police force is 94% white (only three of the 53 police officers are black), and the city is 67% black and 29% white. Both North Charleston and Ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve, yet because of a video North Charleston's police force got in front of the story. I'm not sure North Charleston gets here without learning something from the mistakes of Ferguson. I have heard many commentators say the North Charleston shooting doesn't have anything to do with race.  I don't buy it. I wonder how many whites in North Charleston with broken taillights get pulled over? Being pulled over for driving while black is a well-known phenomenon, which I discuss in my \"Critical Race Theory\" casebook. Racial profiling by Slager could have been the catalyst for Scott being pulled over in the first place. Yes, the North Charleston officials behaved differently than the officials in Ferguson. I don't think it's because race had nothing to do with it. It is that perhaps the North Charleston officials are better than those in Ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from Brown's shooting. And, of course, the video. It remains to be seen whether Slager will be convicted of murder. Strange things can happen in a jury room. Recall how the Rodney King videotape allowed a Simi Valley, California, jury to acquit the Los Angeles police officers, but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating King's civil rights. What a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder."}

A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn't she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. \"Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?\" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn't this why rioting happens? I'm not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn't exist. But Baltimore isn't on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don't see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she'd told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn't. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn't take the chance that he'd stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And when she got there and saw he hadn't, as she suspected, she reacted in the way that she knew would, in that moment, be most effective to get him out of there. And that's the key here. It's easy to punish a teenager for acting out, just as it's easy to punish Graham for taking out her frustrations on Michael in a physical way. But Graham's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent. For better or worse, she knows her son. And she knows her community, and her reality. She knows that she's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated, violent moment. And she will do anything to protect her son, including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there. Can we all say that? Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence: Moms have power. The world needs more momma bear types -- mothers who might be willing to put themselves between their child and certain danger. Mothers who are willing to defy the \"expert\" advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior. Now more than ever, there are exceptions to that rule. Those of us who live in communities that are generally safe can't imagine the level of fear and frustration that must run through the very core of a mother like Graham. We don't all face the same obstacles as the people who live in places like Baltimore. But we all face the same challenges in raising children. Perhaps it's time to recognize that, at least in that sense, we're more alike than we are different."}

Established on the birthday of the American founding father, Liberland -- the world's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers-that-be. A tiny, 7 square-kilometer parcel of land, marked on maps as Gornja Siga, its territory abuts the Danube on the border between Serbia and Croatia. The victim of a border dispute between Serbia and Croatia, it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no-man's land. No one lives on this patch of land, which is heavily forested and contains only badly-maintained access roads and a run-down house, abandoned for decades. This is where Euroskeptic Czech politician Vit Jedlicka stepped in. On April 13 he planted his newly-designed yellow and black flag in the territory, declaring the area the Free Republic of Liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country, bigger only than the Vatican and Monaco. He tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 and is inviting, through the media, the world's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation's birth. He says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of Liberland to the ceremony, where he will grant them citizenship. \"I will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party,\" he told CNN by phone. \"It's short notice but a good challenge, and also for  the presidents (and other heads of state) if they can make it to the founding of our country.\" Jedlicka, an active member of the Czech Republic's Party of Free Citizens, opposes excessive government interference. He says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is Liberland. \"I would describe it as a global revolution. It's just the beginning,\" he tells CNN via Skype. Founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is \"To live and let live\" -- its website describes its system of governance as being a \"constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy.\" It will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to Bitcoin -- as its national currency, bypassing the need for a central bank and will, according to its constitution, keep government's noses out of everything possible, from the banks to prostitution. \"Liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation,\" the world's newest constitutional document states. Financial regulation will be minimal, if at all present. Jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received, about 20 of which have been accepted. \"Thousands of Americans, Swiss people. Also a lot of Arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there.\" He envisions, ultimately, a community of around 35,000 Liberlanders, not all of whom will be full-time residents. He says he expects trouble from his neighbors, whose land he has effectively annexed. \"From Serbia, Croatia, we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation, and we will offer nothing but passive resistance. For now, (though) we will make roads, docks.\" For its part, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement to CNN that stated that Liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border, which is delineated by the Danube, but \"the Ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment.\" Croatia's counterpart was similarly dismissive. \"Virtual quips, however interesting they occasionally sound, remain what they are -- virtual quips, and for them we have no official comment.\""}

Their coats and jackets, still wet, were piled up in a huge container behind them. The 117 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, arrived in the port of Augusta, Sicily, around 1p.m. Tuesday, after being picked up by the tugboat off the coast of Libya. The two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy, the tug's Montenegrin captain told me. The discarded coats, he said, would be thrown away. We had flown to Sicily from Rome following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea. The tragedy adds to the mounting death toll among those fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. So far this year as many as 900 have lost their lives. Last year at least 3,200 died making the journey. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean. Thousands may have died, but even more have succeeded in making the treacherous journey. This small group in Augusta were among nearly 10,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores since the weekend, according to the Italian Coast Guard. With the onset of spring and calmer seas, it appears that the flow of migrants is not relenting. The group, which included 31 women, was composed mostly of Nigerians and Gambians. As they filed off the boat, representatives of the Italian Red Cross did a quick visual inspection, checking for fever, scabies, any sign of illness. One woman, they discovered, was two months pregnant. Timothy, in his mid-20s from Nigeria, told me he left his home nine months ago. He paid human traffickers in Tripoli 1,000 Libyan dinars, more than $700, for the voyage. For him, it's a fortune. I asked 28-year-old Jibril, from Gambia, why he had left his home. \"It's not like in Europe,\" he told me. \"After 20, 25 years, you have to make a future for yourself. But in Gambia, I couldn't. My family, they don't have nothing. They are poor people.\" Mercy, from Kano in northern Nigeria, seemed shell-shocked. In a faint voice she told me she had left Kano because her family feared she that would be taken by Boko Haram. \"I was scared,\" 25-year-old Al-Haji from Gambia told me about the journey from Libya. \"I was taking a big risk. Either I enter Europe or I die.\" Another man, from Liberia, told me he had lived and worked in Libya for 15 years, but was terrified at the prospect of ISIS gaining even more territory. An Egyptian translator working for the Italian police told me they had information that a large group of Syrians were gathered in a Tripoli warehouse, and were expected to make the journey to Italy in the coming days. It seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of Africa and the Middle East -- grinding poverty, war and the rise of ISIS -- are washing up on the shores of Italy. The wars, unrest, upheaval, misery and injustice I've covered over the last 20 years, in Syria, in Libya, in West Africa and elsewhere, seem to be coming together to remind those who have enjoyed Europe's relative peace and prosperity that no man is an island. The small group of migrants in Augusta has been taken in by the Italian authorities. They've been fed, clothed, received medical treatment, and will be taken to migrant camp in northern Italy. Most will then try move further north, to countries like France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, where economic opportunities are better than in austerity-wracked Italy. Others will stay in Italy, trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars. And as they settle in, somehow or other, more and more will come to Italy's shores."}

He grazes under the hot sun, his massive head lowered to the ground,  at  the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya. When he's not wallowing in his enclosure, he waddles around the sprawling savannah, stopping briefly to drink water from a concrete hole. But Sudan is not just any rhino. He's the last known male northern white rhino left in the entire world. For an animal on the verge of extinction, the fate of the subspecies rests on his ability to conceive with the two female northern white rhinos at the conservancy. Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct. The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs. In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching. The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos. At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25. Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy. \"Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female,\" he says. In addition, he has a low sperm count, which complicates natural and scientific efforts, experts say. Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male. \"There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions,\" Paul says. \"Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded.\" And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct. Rhinos on a plane: Life-saving mission across borders . In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies. The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say. A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization. \"In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising,\" Paul says. \"However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward.\" Bringing rhinos back to Uganda, one calf at a time . The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire. \"Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future,\" Paul says. \"This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen.\" The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year. In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction. There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild. A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic. But Sudan, a male, is in a company of one. 11 wildlife experiences that could vanish in your lifetime ."}

The officer wounded, John Moynihan, is white. Angelo West, the gunman shot to death by officers, was black. After the shooting, community leaders in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Roxbury, where the shooting occurred, were quick to call for calm. One said the officers were forced to return fire. Still, they were glad to see the video released for the sake of transparency. \"I think people understand that the decisions Mr. West made put his life in grave jeopardy,\" clergyman Mark V. Scott told CNN affiliate WCVB. West had several prior gun convictions, police said. Moynihan is a former U.S. Army Ranger who was honored at the White House for his heroism in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. The \"Top Cop\" helped save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the bombers. Last month, he became a gunshot victim when he and other officers in unmarked cars, but with blue lights flashing, stopped the car West was driving. When Moynihan opened the driver's-side door, the video shows, West sprang out and fired a shot with a pistol at the officer's face. As West ran away, he fired back at the other officers with his .357 Magnum handgun, police said. They returned fire and killed him. Moynihan, 34, survived with a bullet wound under one eye. He was placed in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital. On Saturday, Moynihan was released from the hospital. \"His condition is best described as serious but improving,\" Boston police said in a statement. \"In the days after the shooting, John and his family have been strengthened, humbled and inspired by the outpouring of love and support they've received -- not only from his closest friends and fellow officers -- but also from concerned citizens and strangers from all over the country wishing him a full and speedy recovery.\" A woman who was driving by at the time of the shooting suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. \"None of our officers like to use their firearms,\"  Police Commissioner William Evans said at the time. \"It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face.\" In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. In the battle, police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. Moynihan and other Massachusetts officers were cited for their \"heroic and relentless\" life-saving measures on Donohue, who nearly lost his entire blood volume on the Watertown street. At a White House ceremony in May, President Barack Obama honored Moynihan and 52 other officers as \"America's Top Cops.\" After Moynihan was wounded and West killed, police and and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Scott, of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston, said Moynihan was shot \"assassination-style.\" He called for calm in Roxbury. \"This is not about 'Black Lives Matter,' \" he said, referring to a protest movement that emerged after the shootings. \"It's about 'All Lives in the Community Matter,' and it's about the police ... responding to a concern from the community.\" CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report."}

Officer Michael Rapiejko was with the New York Police Department from 2003 to 2006. Two years after he left, he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that Rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest. The lawsuit said Luis Colon had parked his car and gotten out when Rapiejko, with his gun aimed at Colon, ordered him back into the car. During his arrest on charges of obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Colon alleged he was yanked from the car, handcuffed and choked. The charges against Colon were dropped six months later. Colon also sued two unnamed officers who arrived after the initial confrontation, court documents show. Colon and the city settled the suit for $20,000. The settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing . Rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006, and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the NYPD, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. The NYPD has said that it will not release further details about Rapiejko. Rapiejko's actions in Marana, Arizona, in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer, have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer for the February incident. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a nearby Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Rapiejko's camera shows the officer's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force,\" Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several crimes there the day he was struck, including a stealing a car that he drove a half hour north to Marana. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Marana police on Thursday told CNN's Miguel Marquez that a store gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. The wire that goes through the trigger and the lever to reload the gun were loose enough to allow it to still be used, police said.

The voice of Michael Slager can be heard in both. The former North Charleston police officer is charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. In the first recording, an unidentified officer talks to Slager about what might happen. \"Once they get here, it'll be real quick. They're gonna tell you, you're gonna be off for a couple days and we'll come back and interview you then. They're not gonna ask you any type of questions right now. They're gonna take your weapon,\" the officer says. \"It'd probably be a good idea to jot down your thoughts about whatever happened ... once the adrenaline stops pumping.\" Slager responds: \"It's pumping,\" and then laughs. The second audio, taken from dash cam video from inside a patrol car, captures a phone call between Slager and someone CNN believes is his wife. He tells her: \"Hey. Hey, everything's OK. OK? I just shot somebody.\" \"He grabbed my Taser, yeah. Yeah,\" says Slager. \"He was running from me. ... I'm fine.\" If convicted of murder, the former officer faces up to life in prison or the death penalty, although a death penalty case appears unlikely at this point. \"Based on the facts revealed thus far, it does not appear South Carolina's death penalty provision applies in this case because there are no statutory 'aggravating circumstances' present,\" Scarlett A. Wilson, who is the chief prosecutor for the Ninth Judicial Circuit in the state, said on her Facebook page. Slager was charged after cell phone video emerged, showing him firing at Scott as the man ran away. Who was Walter Scott? Pierre Fulton was riding in a car with Scott before the shooting took place. \"Walter was a dear friend and I miss him every day,\" Fulton said in a statement given to ABC News by his lawyer.  \"Over the past five years he helped me to become a better man and showed me the value of hard work.\" \"I'll never know why he ran, but I know he didn't deserve to die,\" Fulton said.  \"Please keep Walter and his family in your prayers and respect my privacy moving forward.\" Scott's passenger meets with police . Scott's death has reignited a national conversation around race and policing. Scott was black; Slager is white. The case has also brought to light previous instances in which Slager's behavior on the job is being questioned. On Monday, attorneys for a man named Julius Wilson announced that they were filing a lawsuit in connection with an August 2014 traffic stop. During the stop, three officers -- including Slager -- pulled Wilson out of his car. Wilson was then allegedly shocked with a stun gun. The suit claims Slager used excessive force. Slager was also named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly \"Tased a man for no reason\" before slamming him to the ground and dragging him, according to the North Charleston Police Department. At the time, Slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall. The African-American man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall. A lawyer for Mario Givens, the man who filed the complaint, said last week that his client plans to file a lawsuit. Givens said Slager came to his door, ordered him out of the house and then Tased him. Slager was later cleared in that incident. What we know about Officer Slager .

The world's leading showjumping and dressage horses have reached Las Vegas for this week's World Cup Finals. The man who arranged their travel says, for horses, it's business class all the way. \"There are two horses per box,\" explains Tim Dutta, who oversaw the loading of more than $150 million in equine talent onto a Qatar Airways flight at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport earlier this month. \"We pay attention to each horse's little idiosyncrasies and requirements -- do they like wet hay, or not? Do we use sea salt to encourage them to drink? \"I like the horses to have some quiet time too, they need that. So when the aircraft is at cruise then they are left alone for a while, to have a snooze and relax, without being bothered by anyone.\" No horse is snoozing now. The flights are over and they're in Las Vegas to work. Vegas is home to the finals for the sixth time since first hosting showjumping in 2000. The venue is the Thomas & Mack Center, a stone's throw from the Strip, which had the distinction of being opened by Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross in 1983. Organizers believe more than 80,000 fans will attend this week's event, which boasts an $8 million budget. Expect Elvis Presley beaming down from the Jumbotron; chefs from the Bellagio serving VIP guests who paid upwards of $1,500 a ticket; and tennis legend Steffi Graf presenting the trophies. In the past, that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that's something the sport is trying to change. Hosting world-class horsesport in Vegas is a way to raise its profile in the United States. As with this month's showjumping on Miami Beach, the thinking is location, location, location. For the riders, few locations are comparable. \"It's like a Wrigley Field feel,\" said Tim Keener, one of the Vegas organizers, describing how the bowl of the arena will seat spectators unusually close to the action. Showjumping comes here for the showbiz. In previous years, trophies have been handed out by flying showgirls descending from the rafters. Elvis impersonators have burst into the arena on horseback. This year, a \"selfie booth\" will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders. Since the World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious titles available, the cast list over the next four days features almost all of the world's top names. In showjumping, Germany's Daniel Deusser is both the defending World Cup champion and the new world No. 1, unseating Britain's Scott Brash. The Germans are the most successful nation at the World Cup Finals, with 10 showjumping victories, and three-time champion Marcus Ehning will also compete. The hosts have a superstar and 2013 champion in Beezie Madden, while 2012 champion Rich Fellers will ride aptly named \"comeback king\" Flexible, a horse undeterred by a series of illnesses and injuries which would have seen almost any other stallion retire. In dressage, Britain's Charlotte Dujardin and Valero are the runaway favorites to successfully defend last year's World Cup title. The partnership is the first ever to hold the World Cup alongside Olympic, world and European gold. Few riders are expected to mount a serious challenge if Dujardin and Valegro perform well, but watch out for Germany's Isabell Werth and up-and-coming US rider Laura Graves. Graves, 27, has barely spent a year on the U.S. senior team, yet finished fifth in last year's World Equestrian Games on board Verdades. The action begins on Thursday, April 16, with dressage reaching a climax on the Saturday and showjumping a day later. But if you miss it, the chances are you won't have to wait long for another chance. Vegas is so in love with horses, organizers are already planning a bid to bring the event back in 2019."}

Brady, 73, died of pneumonia, the family said. \"Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives,\" their statement said. James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot in the head by John Hinckley Jr. during his attempt to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Brady spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, advocating against gun violence. He died in August. Sarah Brady was also involved in gun violence prevention for the past 30 years. She was the chairwoman of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 2000 until she died. The National Rifle Association said its thoughts and prayers were with the Brady family. \"Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,\" the gun rights organization said. People we've lost in 2015 . On the Brady Campaign's website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend's pickup. Her son started to wave it around and she took it from him. It was not a toy, she said, and she fumed over what she imagined could have happened. The loaded gun was much like the one used to shoot her husband. \"It just hit me like a ton of bricks,\" she told CNN in 2013. \"So I asked Jim if he felt comfortable with me speaking out, and he said, 'Of course.'\" After that, the Bradys made it their business to be gun control activists. Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby's, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland's 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993's Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some military-style firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004. Read Sarah Brady's 2014 op-ed for CNN.com . Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Brady bill in 1993, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Saturday that the Bradys \"were fierce champions of sensible gun legislation.\" Sarah Brady \"transformed tragedy into a courageous campaign, and because of her work and her remarkable life, American families are safer today,\" the Clintons said. Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross said in a written statement that few people are responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and James Brady. \"Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend,\" he said. \"I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable.\" Sen Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped write the Brady bill, concurred. \"She was strong and forceful, sweet and kind, and someone I considered a friend and patriot for decades,\" he said. \"She was a true hero and will be missed by America.\" James Brady was one of four people wounded in Reagan's shooting outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital. The Brady bill was fiercely fought over for seven years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.

Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in eastern Kenya this month, killing 147 people. Kenya's government says that attack was masterminded by senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, whose \"extensive terrorist network within Kenya\" extends into the sprawling Dadaab complex, according to a Kenyan government document given to CNN. Students wake to Islamist militants' terror . Ruto, who is the second highest-ranking person in Kenya's government behind President Uhuru Kenyatta, said his government has had discussions with United Nations officials about what to do with the camp. On Saturday, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees officer said the agency had not received any formal request from Kenya's government about moving Dadaab. The U.N. refugee agency manages the Dadaab complex, having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid Somalia's civil war. The agency and the governments of both Kenya and Somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of Somali refugees. But that was supposed to be mutually agreed-upon and voluntary, in accordance with the refugees' \"freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions\" where they'd end up, according to the pact. None of those things, it seems, applies now to the move pushed by Ruto on Saturday. It's not clear where he expects the refugees to go, other than somewhere into Somalia and out of Kenya. Any mass move would be a monumental task, disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 Somalis who call the camp their home. Simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex, which has seen devastating droughts, contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help. Still, as tough as conditions there are, they are seen as a better alternative to life back in Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based and has carried out violent attacks for years. Yet the Islamist extremist group hasn't confined its terror to its homeland, as illustrated by the Garissa attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, which ended with at least 67 dead. The Dadaab complex came under government scrutiny after the Westgate Mall attack, too. But just a few weeks later, CNN's Nima Elbagir managed to go from Somalia to the Dadaab refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya, or \"rat routes,\" just like many others have done, Al-Shabaab sympathizers among them. Such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers' willful ignorance of migrants' fake IDs, as acknowledged by then-Interior Minister Ole Lemku, illustrates Kenya's challenge in keeping out threats from Somalia. That's why, in addition to moving the Dadaab camp, Kenya is building of a 435-mile (700-kilometer) wall covering most of the Somali border from Mandera to Kiunga -- a wall that Ruto says has begun to prevent Al-Shabaab elements from getting into Kenya. The deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down. These measures are in addition to Kenyan airstrikes on Al-Shabaab camps in Somalia in the days after the Garissa massacre. \"We must secure this country at whatever cost, even if we lose business with Somalia,\" Ruto said Saturday. \"No politics, no games, no half-measures should apply, as the death of the 147 students must touch all Kenyans.\" CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta."}

What was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of Chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay. It's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members, just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) over five months. \"You can believe that your will can influence the weather,\" says pilot Bertrand Piccard, who comes from a long family line of explorers.  But \"then you'll be really disappointed because it doesn't work. \"Or you just know that it's an adventure you do with the forces of nature.\" Piccard, along with Andre Borschberg, a Swiss engineer, are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft, which took off from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has successfully flown through Oman, India, and Myanmar. There is much at stake. Their mission, which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation, has been 12 years in the making. In many ways, it has become Piccard and Borschberg's raison d'etre. But so far, the Solar Impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground. The latest setback came when a Thursday takeoff was canceled, because the cross winds in Nanjing, the plane's destination, were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time. Because of its weight, at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large SUV -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions, including cross winds of less than 4 knots, or about 7 kilometers an hour, in order to fly. While the team is used to waiting, they are clearly eager to move on. \"Our boss is the sun,\" says Solar Impulse spokeswoman Claudia Durgnat. Durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead, with the next possible departure from Chongqing on Tuesday. \"It's not good before, and the days after don't look very clear.\" Even with the delay, Durgnat says, the plane technically isn't behind schedule. That's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer, before the plane can venture across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. With more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage, the Solar Impulse 2 stores up energy during the day, in order to power the motors that carry it through the night, typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway. Inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at Chongqing International Airport, a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day's tasks. The rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in Nanjing. Even with the extended stay, no time is wasted. Piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit, training to prepare for the Solar Impulse's crossings over the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, what the team calls \"the moment of truth.\" The plane will then return to Abu Dhabi, where it had taken off. Nearby, two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers, which display critical information in the cockpit, punching extra holes in their casings so they don't overheat. Meanwhile, Borschberg has returned to Switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition. The team expects him back in China early next week. Borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the Pacific crossing, which could last up to five days and nights. \"The airplane is ready. The mission control center is ready. We've been waiting for that moment since so long,\" says Piccard. Borschberg and Piccard, who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the U.S. in 2013, are no strangers to adventure. Borschberg is a former fighter pilot, and Piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999."}

President Obama briefly met his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, on Friday night at a dinner for the dozens of Latin American leaders convening in Panama City for the Summit of the Americas. This was historic. The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years. The meeting was so important that Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokesperson, issued a statement: \"At the Summit of the Americas this evening, President Obama and President Castro greeted each other and shook hands.\" Cuba and the United States had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart. Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern U.S. history, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs and the Mariel boatlift of 1980. But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face. Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with the Cuban leader before heading to Panama. They met Friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on Saturday when the summit begins in earnest. Obama arrived in Panama late Thursday for the conference, which in years past was tinged with animosity at Cuba's exclusion. Moments after Marine One, Obama's helicopter, touched down in Panama City, Castro's plane landed on the same tarmac. Panamanian television carried both arrivals live. During their phone call Wednesday, Obama and Castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. He said it \"made sense\" for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions Friday and Saturday. Those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the United States and Cuba since a meeting between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and then-Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959. \"We're in new territory here,\" Rhodes said on Friday. \"The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation, focused totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\" Obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference, after announcing in December he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. In Panama, Obama is expected to announce he's removing Cuba from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries. The State Department delivered its report on the designation to the White House on Wednesday; Obama said on Thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination. The White House isn't ruling out a final decision before Obama leaves Panama late Saturday night. In remarks during a brief stopover in Jamaica on Thursday, Obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove Cuba from the list, which also includes Iran, Sudan and Syria. \"Throughout this process, our emphasis has been on the facts,\" Obama said. \"So we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism, that when we make those designations we've got strong evidence that, in fact, that's the case.\" \"As circumstances change, then that list will change as well,\" he said. While some inside Cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw, U.S. officials say they're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties, which the White House argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region. Obama said in Jamaica he \"never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself.\" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. Even as Obama landed in Panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-Castro activists was on full display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the Cuban government. Rhodes said the White House had \"expressed serious concerns\" about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island."}

He was 87. Grass died in a clinic in the city of Luebeck, where he was taken over the weekend, said Steidl publishing spokeswoman Claudia Glenewinkel. German media are reporting he died of pneumonia. Grass focused in much of his work on learning from the horror of war and genocide by exploring motifs from his childhood city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. During the Nazi era, ethnic Poles and Jews were persecuted and deported from the multicultural city, at a time when they faced the possibility of mass murder. \"In his excavation of the past, Günter Grass goes deeper than most and he unearths the intertwined roots of good and evil,\" the Nobel committee wrote, when it awarded him the literature prize in 1999. But Grass, an outspoken public figure, has sparked controversy in the last decade. In 2006, he confessed that at the age of 15, in 1943, he volunteered for military service in Germany's war of aggression and ended up in the notoriously bloody Waffen SS. Grass said he had no excuses for his choices back then, and that, as a teen, he may even have been excited about belonging to the unit, which he saw then as an elite group. A year later, he penned a detailed account in The New Yorker on how he spent his war years up to the death of German dictator Adolf Hitler. Three years ago, Grass drew controversy again, when he published a poem in a German newspaper discouraging Germany from selling more submarines to Israel. In \"What must be said,\" Grass accused Germany of selling weapons to a potential aggressor out of guilt over the Holocaust. Grass said Israel could use nuclear weapons to kill masses of Iranians. German commentators pilloried him as subconsciously anti-Semitic. Israel invoked a visa ban, and then-Interior Minister Eli Yishai declared Grass a \"persona non grata\" in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported. Grass' novel characters are the forgotten, the downtrodden and the weird, the Nobel committee said. And like Oskar Matzerath, the boy in \"The Tin Drum,\" they often slip into surreal situations. This was a literary innovation, the committee said, which was furthered by other great authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Salman Rushdie. On Monday, Rushdie tweeted about Grass' death:  \"This is very sad. A true giant, inspiration, and friend.\" \"The Tin Drum,\" which was published in 1959, \"breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old, a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum,\" the Nobel committee wrote. The committee praised Grass' mastery of the German language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences. Grass was an icon in contemporary German culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache, his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses, a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand. In his later years, he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events. As recently as March, Grass criticized the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. He used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests. \"It's not Islam that threatens the Federal Republic (of Germany),\" he said in an interview with rp-online.de, \"but political lobbying. Democracy has decayed into fake democracy.\" Grass has also suggested that Germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world's destitute."}

In other interviews, Santana has said he feared for his life, which almost kept him from revealing the recording. Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. That evidence led to the officer's firing and arrest on a murder charge. Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He could hear the sound of a Taser in use. At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana told CNN. Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser. After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer went back to pick up something. Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he wasn't 100% sure what it was. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording. What we know about Officer Slager . The cell phone video, which Santana revealed this week, reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black. Police said Slager pulled the 50-year-old Scott over for a nonworking brake light on Saturday morning. Scott, according to a dash cam video, fled from Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot. When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down. Who was Walter Scott? Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward. \"He was there. God planned that. He's the ram in the bush -- I truly believe that,\" Judy Scott said. Santana agreed. \"I think she was right,\" he said. \"God put me there for a reason.\" Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording. \"When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I couldn't take it,\" she said. \"I had to turn away. I couldn't handle it. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution. \"At some point I thought about staying anonymous, and don't show my face, don't talk about it. But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am,\" Santana said. Santana did not say whether he had received threats. His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention. In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands. Witness video, official accounts raise questions . Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR. A police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person \"with first aid and CPR.\" On Wednesday, asked whether CPR was performed on Scott, North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" A timeline of events .

The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, \"Ernst Haas: On Set.\" \"Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,\" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. The photographers \"are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,\" Jacob said. Such distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on. There's a striking picture of Orson Welles in 1949's \"The Third Man,\" hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film. Another, of Gregory Peck and Chuck Connors in 1958's \"The Big Country,\" is as dramatic as any full-scale movie duel. (Westerns were a specialty.) But Haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work, whether it's capturing the sprawling, workaday set of 1965's \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" or snapping a relaxed picture of Barbara Streisand as Dolly Levi in 1969's \"Hello, Dolly!\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The former is particularly interesting: an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene, surrounded by ladders, a camera crane, a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members. Jacob observes that in each of Haas' images there's an eye for the unusual. The black-and-white work from \"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\" for example, is almost prayerful, while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film. And some of Haas' other color images, especially his work for 1961's \"West Side Story,\" fit in neatly with others in his catalog, as Haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that Jacob calls \"the Haas effect.\" Haas died in 1986, and despite being celebrated during his life, his name is somewhat forgotten these days. Jacob hopes that \"Ernst Haas: On Set\" reminds people just what a master he was. \"A lot of these are familiar images, but you don't necessarily associate them with Haas,\" he said. \"On the other hand, people who know Haas well don't actually know this work, because it was work for hire and wasn't ever put together in this way before.\" Ernst Haas was an Austrian photographer who passed away in 1986. He was a member of Magnum Photos."}

From cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites, all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue, there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser. Swiss physicist Jean-Pierre Wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list: using focused laser beams to affect the weather. It sounds like black magic, but it's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding, a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by China in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony. But it's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is, and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere, something which it surely doesn't need. Laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding: it's light, and nothing but light. How does laser actually affect the weather? Just like cloud seeding, it can create new clouds where there are none, by inducing condensation: naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets, and ice crystals form, mimicking the natural process that creates clouds. That way, rainfall can be triggered to \"empty\" the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on: \"We did it on a laboratory scale, we can already create clouds, but not on a macroscopic scale, so you don't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we can't yet control,\" Professor Wolf told CNN's Nick Glass. That is not to say that the laser he's tested isn't powerful: at one terawatt, it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on Earth: \"Of course, it doesn't last very long,\" Wolf said. The technology is still in its infancy then, but once it's perfected, it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast, such as California or Chile, where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity. Through lasers, those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding-prone areas and more rain in drought-prone areas: \"You can transport the water to a different location,\" Wolf said. Laser seeding can make more than clouds: it can also trigger lightning. \"We also showed that it's possible to trigger lightning in clouds, within clouds, but not to the ground, yet.\" Recent tests have shown promise: \" A few years ago, in New Mexico, we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere, trying to trigger lightning. We didn't, but we could see some small discharge, lightning, within the cloud. You know, 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud, not against the Earth. So, we are still working on that, but there is hope.\" Controlling lightning, or facilitating its discharge in a desired location, would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year, adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes. Affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change. Professor Wolf reckons lasers could be used to \"repair\" the weather, reducing the occurrence of hurricanes, thunderstorms, flooding, and drought. But his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds: \"There are potential applications in the biomedical field: by changing the color of the laser, we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells, with little or no collateral damage.\" Yet another potential application to add to that list: \"Every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers, something new comes up: it's quite amazing.\""}

The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed. But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits. Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers. At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam. But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them. In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East. \"Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here,\" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS. And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble. Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter . Today, ISIS occupies much more accessible territory, mostly reachable through Turkey. Istanbul's airport has easy connections to Western Europe and much of the rest of the world. From there, Turkey's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to Syria. The informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials, who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward. \"It's harder for us to pick up on,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment, which is well below the radar. How ISIS is luring Westerners . Before ISIS, investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks. Al Qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect Islamic holy lands. Much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative Islamic histories, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, U.S. officials said. In contrast, ISIS takes a somewhat secular approach, portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt West. And people attracted to ISIS' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor, educated to dropout, male to female, teenaged to middle-aged. There are signs Western recruits have risen to high levels in the ISIS organization, with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda, counterterrorism and intelligence officials said. The English is proper, with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes. And while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts, it also means that U.S. authorities don't see the lure of ISIS receding any time soon. \"We are opening cases quicker than we are closing them,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?"}

The FBI said Friday that it will investigate whether civil rights were violated during the videotaped beating of a suspect in San Bernardino. The suspect  allegedly fled by car, foot and horseback when law enforcement officers tried to arrest him. Earlier Friday, San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon said criminal investigations have begun into the actions of deputies as well as the suspect. In addition, an internal investigation has been launched. Ten deputies identified as being involved in the case have been put on paid administrative leave, McMahon said Friday. In video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times. Pusok was later hospitalized, KNBC reported, citing authorities. \"The video surrounding this arrest is disturbing and I have ordered an internal investigation be conducted immediately,\" McMahon said in a statement. \"What I saw on the television was thugs beating up my client,\" said Jim Terrell, Pusok's family attorney, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. \"That's what I saw. And these questions about what was he doing? What did they do? This is far worse than Rodney King.\" The ACLU of Southern California issued a statement Friday saying that it was \"deeply troubled\" by the images. \"While we applaud Sheriff John McMahon's prompt decision to investigate the disturbing actions of his deputies, we believe more is needed,\" the organization said. \"Too often the department has failed to address questions, including those raised by the ACLU SoCal, about use of force and Taser policies.\" Coming soon: An app to report police brutality . The Thursday afternoon incident began when deputies tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Pusok fled in a vehicle, and deputies pursued him through the unincorporated area of Apple Valley, the town of Apple Valley and farther into the unincorporated area of Hesperia, the sheriff's office said in a news release. Pusok abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot into steep, rugged terrain, with deputies pursing with off-highway vehicles and helicopters, the sheriff's office said. \"Within minutes, deputies received information that the suspect came into contact with a group of people near the Deep Creek Hot Springs and stole a horse. He fled on horseback on dirt trails, through very rugged, steep terrain, causing numerous injuries to the horse,\" the sheriff's office said. A helicopter dropped deputies onto the ground, and as they approached Pusok to make the arrest, he was thrown from the horse, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said a Taser was used on Pusok but was ineffective because of his loose clothing. A deputy was injured when the horse Pusok had been riding kicked him, the Sheriff's Department said. Two other deputies were treated for dehydration. The incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of police use of force after the 2014 deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the recent shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina. In the California case, the FBI said the results of its investigation will be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California and Justice Department in Washington to determine whether prosecution is warranted.

With over 4,400 dead, 8,000 injured and 8 million people across Nepal affected, numerous aid groups and at least 16 nations have rushed to send supplies and workers to the stricken country. But now the Nepalese government and army who are leading the disaster response face another problem: How to effectively coordinate and organize the massive influx of humanitarian aid. Here are three major obstacles that are hampering efforts of distribution. Nepal relies on only one international airport to receive and deliver aid. Relief organizations say the tarmac at Tribhuvan International Airport remains jam-packed with a large number of cargo planes. Several aircraft carrying essential supplies have been turned away, or diverted to India and elsewhere. \"The airport is totally congested. Even the planes which have landed, goods haven't been offloaded,\" Jagan Chapagain, the Asia Pacific Director of the IFRC (International Federations of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies) told CNN. Flightradar24, a live air traffic monitor, shows that incoming flights have had to circle in the air several times before being able to land. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team who is on the ground coordinating international relief efforts says they are doing all they can to address the problem. \"There are lots of flights arriving from around the world for search and rescue, and that's the challenge we're trying to address by supporting the airport staff directly,\" said Marcus Werne, a UNDAC team leader. But Chapagain says that airport management is still chaotic, with staff and military not being able to clear runways and offload supplies effectively. According to a U.N. situation report, main roads in Kathmandu are open, but remote areas are largely inaccessible. \"Due to the mountainous geography, infrastructure damage, collapsed bridges and damaged roads, access to many of the affected areas is reported to be extremely limited,\" read the report. The Nepalese government has not been able to provide relief to all affected areas due to difficulties in transporting goods, a government official told CNN. \"The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain we cannot use surface transport much but we are using it,\" said Sagar Mani Parajuli, the Joint Secretary for Nepal's Home Ministry. The situation has deteriorated to the point where relief workers are as good as stranded. Pirtha Raj Joshi, a disaster management officer for Nepal Red Cross, had to walk 10 hours to reach a office in one of the severely affected districts, said Chapagain. Initial reports from the IFRC say that over 36,000 houses have been totally destroyed, with the number expected to rise as teams arriving in severely affected areas continue to assess damages. Just two days after the earthquake struck, Nepalese authorities leading the response are still trying to fully understand which areas have been affected, how they are affected and what the priorities are. \"Typically what we see, also in other emergencies, is that it takes a few days for supply lines, distribution lines to stabilize,\" UNDAC's Werne told CNN. \"Right now we're working with a lot of secondary data, and working on some of the key vulnerable areas identified prior to the earthquake,\" he added. The operation to get aid to survivors in Nepal is still \"very ad hoc\" and it will be a few days before the distribution becomes organized because the government is still constrained by the scale of the disaster, says Chapagain.

His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed \"powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children.\" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. \"It was horror,\" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. \"People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone.\" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: \"If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater,\" he said. \"Blackwater killed my son.\" Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government \"should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened.\" Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first .

The call came just before the U.N. Security Council met late Saturday morning to discuss the situation in the Arabian Peninsula nation, where Shiite rebels are pitted against external Arab air forces and fighters loyal to Yemen's displaced Sunni president. A pause was needed especially in and near the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Food, water, medical items and personnel need to get into these areas, the group said. \"Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,\" Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, said. Another Red Cross official said people are running out of food, water and fuel. \"Medical supplies need to be here yesterday. The situation is difficult,\"said Marie-Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the ICRC who is in the capital, Sanaa. \"We need to save the lives that can be saved.\" Meanwhile, residents of Sanaa, witnessed the fiercest Saudi strikes since the air assault started last week. Military facilities, including two bases, within the city limits have been targeted, three senior security officials in Sanaa said. At the Security Council, Russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, has been conducting against the rebels in Yemen for more than a week. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements. It doesn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting, and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to hit the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. A Saudi source told CNN that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to Yemeni fighters in Aden loyal to Hadi. The Houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city, including the presidential palace there, the source said. Saudi special forces help oppose Houthi rebels in Yemen, source says . The United Nations said Thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in Yemen in the past two weeks. An additional 1,700 have been wounded. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Somalia and Djibouti. In Aden alone, fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days, Yemeni security officials said. At least 24 of the dead were Houthis. Complicating matters in Yemen is that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or Hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. Also late this week, photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al Qaeda leader Khaled Batarfi  -- whom Yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on Thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern Yemen. Sunni Islamist fighters freed Batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al Mukallah. On Saturday, the French military evacuated 44 people, including some French nationals, from the eastern Yemeni port city of Balhaf.

They carried duffel bags, plastic bags full of clothes and small suitcases. They'd already abandoned larger bags in a mound. Only carry-on luggage was allowed on this Air India plane. The passengers were mostly Indian nationals, plus Yemenis and people from other countries who had been working in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. They sprinted or walked with deliberation to the airplanes. The stress of living in a war zone showed on the passengers' faces. Nobody wanted to be left behind. They climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the Air India crew, all wearing pressed uniforms, the flight attendants fully made up. After takeoff, the flight attendants went up and down the aisle offering drinks to the 188 evacuees as if they were on a vacation flight. But some passengers were already fast asleep, exhausted by the push to get out of Yemen, site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Mideast. This scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of Sanaa during a small window when Saudi planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the Houthis, a Shiite group that has taken over the capital. Air India is especially active because so many Indian nationals work in other nations. Over the last few days, India has evacuated some 2,500 people from Yemen, said Gen. Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister who's overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, the small African nation nearly 430 kilometers (267 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats at port cities such as Aden. People are leaving behind much more than luggage. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, lived in the capital 34 years and built a life there. He loved living in Yemen. \"I never felt like a foreigner,\" he said. Like the others, he was exhausted and jangled by the shelling and lack of electricity for long stretches. \"At night, my goodness!\" he said. \"Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad.\" The Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But the Saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. The loading of passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- another touch of normalcy in the otherwise abnormal event. They didn't  pay for the flight, though they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. \"Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,\" Thakur said."}

Stuffed animals remain in one room. On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets. Kenya terrorist attack: 6 things you need to know . Investigators marked the locations of students' bodies with numbered tags before Red Cross workers came in to send them off to morgues. They would call out to each other with the locations of the dead, reducing once promising lives, for the time being at least, to numbers. 221. 214. 216. 217. Sometimes, the cell phones of the dead would ring, taking the workers aback. Beyond the bodies, evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere. Shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor. Walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes. In some places, the blood was as thick as mud. The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts . According to students and authorities, militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. Thursday. The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won't be shot. \"They were lying,\" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they'd usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. \"Shoot them! Shoot them!\" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn't belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. \"Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,\" Titus said the gunman in charge said. \"We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we're going to be killed,\" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. \"In the time of shooting, they skipped me,\" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo. Even longtime relief workers such as Reuben Nyaora with the International Rescue Committee said they were shocked at what they saw. \"I have seen many things,\" Nyaora told Agence France-Presse, \"but nothing like that.\" Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out .

The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress."}

As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take \"scorched earth\" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS . Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. \"The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,\" al-Ghabban said. \"In the coming hours, the battle will end.\" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. \"We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,\" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London.

Their technology creates tactile three-dimensional shapes literally out of thin air, using ultrasound. The company's tagline says it all: \"Feeling without touching.\" Through an emission of sound waves, sensations are projected through the air and to the user. Changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces, creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces. This already sounds quite intriguing, but paired with another rising technology it has the potential to become a game changer. The rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable: Facebook's Oculus Rift and Magic Leap are leading the pack, but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment. But even though it is incredibly convincing, virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch: applying UltraHaptics' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes, but to touch it as well. Tom Carter, UltraHaptics' CTO, sees potential in the merging of these technologies: \"The ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones, but also touch what you can see, is a really exciting possibility,\" he told CNN's Nick Glass. Creating buttons and shapes literally anywhere they're needed opens up a slew of possibilities for more traditional devices as well. \"Imagine the dashboard of a car having no buttons, no switches, no ugly controls: just a very nice, sleek dashboard. \"If you're driving and you want to have the music up for example, you don't have to take your eyes off the road, you just hold your hand out and the controls stick to your hand, so you can feel them.\" Smartphones and other popular devices could also see benefits: controlling appliances in the kitchen, using TVs and computers in a style reminiscent of the movie \"Minority report\", or even snoozing the alarm in the morning would all become just a matter of waving your hands. (This probably wouldn't be the most virtuous application of the technology.) Several devices can already be controlled with gestures, but UltraHaptics add an extra layer of feedback, by generating the sensation of a force field: \"Haptics is more than just the sense of touch. It's really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch. What you're feeling, what sort of pressure, the tactile sensation given by an object or surface. You also know where your limbs are and how they're moving, all from the sense of touch. It's all this information that cues how you're interacting with the world,\" Carter said. To create their invisible buttons, UltraHaptics use a small collection of ultrasonic speakers, concentrating the sound waves to a specific point. Sound travels through air by creating a pressure differential, so by focusing several of these differentials to a target location, the result is a single localized spot of high pressure. \"If you put your hand in the way, it actually emits enough of a force on your hand to slightly displace your skin. \"We use that and control it to vibrate your skin, and give you this feeling. What you eventually get is a sensation of vibration on your hands,\" Carter explained. With the current prototype, the smallest point that can be created is 8.5 millimeters in diameter, but the shape can be morphed into a surface, creating different textures over a single \"object\" by differentiating the pressure levels. Other companies are working on similar projects, such as Elliptic Labs, and the interest around the technology already appears to be strong. UltraHaptics, who have already built several prototypes and have demoed the technology to the public at the last CES in Las Vegas, say they are working with 15 to 20 clients who are looking to incorporate tactile ultrasound into their products. \"We have everything from consumer electronics companies making things like speakers, radios, alarm clocks, through home appliance companies making cooker hoods, washing machines, to virtual reality in gaming companies. And we were very surprised at how keen the automotive industry is to work with us,\" Carter said. \"I'd like to believe that the first product featuring our technology will be on the shelves in a year, that's our aim.\" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

There is a third path. We can cooperate with the world.\" Rouhani said his government kept its word to Iranians when negotiating the framework deal, which was agreed upon Thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a June 30 deadline. Chief among them is that Iran would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions. He thanked Iranians for their patience and for \"resisting\" by standing up for the country's rights. As to the rest of the world, the Iranian President said he thinks most now realize that Iran \"is pursuing peaceful objectives.\" That means trying to develop nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons, as many feared. That fear, combined with distrust of Iran's leaders, spurred the sanctions and the Middle Eastern nation's isolation. \"We do not lie,\" Rouhani said, vowing that Iran will be true to its word, \"provided the other parties will implement their own promises.\" What Iranians think of the deal . Those promises include reducing Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98% for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges. Still, while it will be shrunken and centralized, Iran's nuclear program won't go away. What should happen -- assuming there's a common view that Tehran is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions. That was non-negotiable for Iran, with Rouhani saying the deal shows his government's commitment to removing a major \"obstacle ... for business\" by addressing the world's worries about its nuclear program. \"We need economic productivity, employment for the youth and development of non-oil products,\" he said. \"Thus our people can witness better things for their welfare.\" It won't be easy, of course, to get Iran and the P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- on the same page regarding the nitty-gritty details of any final agreement, if there is one. After all, it took two extra days past a self-imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal. What's in the deal? 7 key points . That agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep-rooted acrimony, particularly between Iran and the United States. Those tensions haven't disappeared, nor is there any guarantee that talks won't fall apart again over the next three months. Even as he applauded what he called a \"good deal,\" President Barack Obama pointed out Thursday that \"if Iran cheats, the world will know it.\" His government is also being pressed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who blasted the agreement Friday as posing a \"grave danger\" by legitimizing Iran's nuclear program and making it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. On the Iranian side, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has acknowledged that \"mutual mistrust\" has long plagued talks. He notes Iran still has \"serious differences with the United States,\" even after Thursday's agreement. Still, Rouhani expressed hopes Friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up Iran to the rest of world, including long-standing adversaries. \"We do shake hands with them. ... Even those countries we have tensions with, we would like an end to the animosity,\" he said. \"Cooperation and interaction would be in the interest of everyone.\" Netanyahu: Iran must recognize Israel's right to exist ."}

Old?\" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and forth phone calls, his initial caginess had given way to greed. He'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate. \"We can get,\" he said. We'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground. We were told he was one of the men running this \"unofficial\" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps. It had all been heartbreakingly simple. We'd asked who had children available to \"foster\" -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children. The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his \"madam\" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as \"sister.\" I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to \"foster\" the children. He told me, \"Sister, Jesus will reward me,\" so the \"fostering\" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would \"live in my heart.\" If I could also then find it \"in my heart\" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be \"God's work.\" In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor. The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country. Paradoxically, the group also rates Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, Naptip, as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations, Nigeria's north. As the insecurity in the region has spiraled, the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks. And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers, concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group. At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge. We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing. I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old. Did I want to consider an older girl? A 12-year-old maybe? She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean. Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said. I could see them then. Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate \"donation\" would be in exchange for the children. He couldn't, he said, bargain for it. He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200. Laughing again at $300. We finally found a figure he didn't find funny -- $500. I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found."}

Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation.

Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report."}

He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return . He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story . Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real \"crossroads of America.\" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 908, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)In this Holy Week, let us be reminded of what the word of God says about fair and living wages. Isaiah 58.6 tells us: . This is the kind of fast day I'm after: . to break the chains of injustice, . get rid of exploitation in the workplace, . free the oppressed, . cancel debts. The McDonald's announcement that the company is going to raise wages for 90,000 of its employees is a significant victory for fast-food cooks and cashiers and those of us who support them. By standing up together, fast-food workers are making it less acceptable for profitable companies like McDonald's to pay wages so low that its workers are boxed into poverty. But this action, which would raise starting wages at 1,500 McDonald's-owned restaurants to at least $1 an hour more than the minimum wage set by local law, falls short in three important ways . First, it leaves out the vast majority of McDonald's workers. The announcement only affects 10% of the McDonald's restaurants in the United States, ignoring the employees who work at franchised McDonald's restaurants. That means hundreds of thousands of workers serving Big Macs and fries won't see a dollar more in their paychecks. McDonald's claims that it has no responsibility for those franchises, but its workers, and the National Labor Relations Board, disagree. Secondly, this raise isn't nearly enough. One dollar above the minimum wage isn't enough to make paying for groceries, rent and transportation much easier, especially coming from a company that makes nearly $5 billion a year in profits. It's not enough for clothing or health care. It's not enough, as people of my faith say, for those cooks and cashiers to afford their daily bread. Thirdly, the raise does nothing to help workers have a voice in determining their workplace conditions. McDonald's and other companies need to stop trying to prevent their workers from speaking out together in a union. They should respect workers' right to collectively demand sensible schedules and such basics as adequate first aid kits, and not being compelled to work off the clock. We are at a turning point in American history. We are at a Third Reconstruction. We are at the moment when forces come together to push this country forward toward the goal of a better life for all: sustainable wages, affordable health care, quality education, and, respect for workers' right to stick together in unions so they can be heard. We are wining this fight, and the McDonald's announcement is proof that the momentum is on our side. When all McDonald's workers have more money in their pockets, they will inject money back into their neighborhoods, boosting the entire economy. Instead of houses in foreclosure and hungry children, we would have a rising wage floor and thriving communities that support more jobs. Today, thousands of McDonald's workers live below the federal poverty line. Many get help from government programs, especially food stamps, to make it week to week. Whether we like it or not, our tax dollars help McDonald's keep wages artificially low. This isn't just an economic issue.  It's a moral issue. I've talked to workers at McDonald's restaurants who say they have to skip meals because they don't have enough money. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \"What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford to buy a hamburger?\" It's time for McDonald's to make sure all the people who serve its burgers are paid enough to afford to eat them for dinner. But we aren't going to wait for divine intervention. We're going to keep organizing and keep fighting until the workers at McDonald's, and every other fast-food restaurant, get what makes sense for their families and our communities: a $15 per hour wage and a path to form a union without interference or retaliation. McDonald's took a small step forward by raising wages for a small minority of the people who run their stores. It's time for the corporation to find a way to raise wages for everyone working in its restaurants so they can pay their bills, put some money back into their community, and expand prosperity and opportunity across our land."}

In light of the tragic massacre of Christian college students in Kenya on Thursday, and the ongoing threat against Christians in other nations, this Holy Week  we are calling upon Christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion, beheading, stoning, enforced slavery, sexual abuse, human trafficking, harassment, bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists. Countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, India, Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria. In June 2012, Bishop Shlemon Warduni of Iraq told the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, \"We beg you to help. We want only peace, security, and freedom. Please no more death, no more explosions, no more injustice.\" By then, nearly every remaining church in Iraq had constructed a blast wall around its building to buffet the threat of the inevitable church bombing. This crisis escalated substantially last summer when ISIS swept like lightning through Iraq's Nineveh province, capturing the country's second-largest city, Mosul; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving Christian community, there centuries before Islam. Again and again the world did not respond as it might have, and now the inconceivable has happened: Iraq's Nineveh Plain has been emptied of its ancient Christianity community, which existed there for more than 1,500 years. On March 27, in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council, Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako referred to the present reality of his fellow Iraqi Christians as a \"catastrophic situation.\" He's right. Rarely since the first century has the church in the East faced persecution on this scale. Christian communities that took 2,000 years to build, and that were started by the apostles themselves, lie in ashes between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Survivors waste away as refugees, often in deplorable conditions, with no homes or churches to return to if the region eventually stabilizes. Whether they be Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant, Christian communities are united in what Pope Francis has called an \"ecumenism of blood,\" recognizing that Christianity is experiencing more martyrdom today than in the first century. This is not an exaggerated or contrived crisis. As Nina Shea, director of the Hudson's Institute's Center for Religious Freedom, has aptly put it, \"Piece by piece, Middle Eastern Christianity is being shattered.\" Our concern is not to the exclusion of anyone else under threat by these religious fanatics, and we reject those who believe that this evil is reflective of the majority of Muslims whose community has actually experienced the most casualties in this conflict. It is also true that Christianity faces a legitimate threat of extinction in several parts of Iraq and Syria and it faces a growing threat in nations such as Nigeria. In solidarity with those being threatened we agree with the words delivered by Jordan's King Abdullah II at the United Nations last fall, \"Christians are an integral part of [the Middle East's] past, present and future.\" When history writes of our time will we be able to say that we tried everything in our power to cease this attempt to eliminate 2,000 years of Christianity from the Middle East and to stop this threat before it spreads to other nations? These communities need our love and support like never before, and they also need security and protection from the world like never before. This Easter we reflect upon the words of a Christian who was himself beheaded for his faith alone. He converted to Christianity one day on a road to Damascus, Syria, when his name was changed from Saul to Paul. In a letter to Christians living in another dangerous place in another persecuted time, he wrote, \"Pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people.\" This Easter, let us earnestly pray with all the love of Christ for all those in harm's way."}

The remains were uncovered by archaeologists from the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (Vetmeduni), exploring the construction site for a shopping center in the city of Tulln in 2006-2007. \"The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,\" archaeozoologist Alfred Galik said. \"But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.\" In their research, published in the journal \"PLOS ONE,\" the archaeologists said Ottoman troops had besieged the area around Tulln in 1683 as they tried to reach Vienna, but that Tulln itself had never been conquered. The Ottoman Army had a \"camelry,\" using camels for transportation and to ride, they said. Despite their city not falling, Tulln inhabitants and the Ottomans were in contact, with historic documents referring to the invading army's peaceful surrender of two prisoners of war, the researchers said. But they said it would be impossible to say how it got into the city. \"Its appearance might be linked to an exchange of local people with the troops or the Ottoman army simply left it behind. Apparently, the citizens took it inside the town, where they probably kept and displayed it as an 'exotic animal,'\" they said. \"It seems quite conceivable that being not familiar with behavioral and feeding habits, the scarcity of food in wartimes, people did not keep it for long.\" While other camel bones have been found in Central Europe, the researchers said this was unique. \"It is the first complete camel skeleton found in Central Europe and Central European territories under the control of the Ottoman Empire, apart from the complete skeleton of a dromedary recovered from the sediments of the Theodosius harbor on the European part of Istanbul.\" DNA analysis on the Tulln skeleton confirmed that it had been one of a hybrid species of camel, specifically a \"Tulu,\" the offspring of dromedary female and a male with Bactrian DNA. \"The two species are able to interbreed, which results in larger, more powerful and efficient hybrid offspring,\" researchers said. \"The camel specimen from Tulln is the first archaeozoologically and genetically confirmed evidence of a Tulu hybrid camel.\" The camel was also believed to have been castrated to make it easier to handle. The Austrians' unfamiliarity with such a beast may have led to the skeleton's preservation. As opposed to the Ottoman troops -- who would likely have eaten the camel's flesh -- the residents of Tulln apparently buried the camel whole. \"The dismemberment of the carcasses certainly is a reason for the scarce preservation of camel finds in general and is indicated by bones with butchering marks in particular. However, the citizens buried this camel in a typical post-mortal position, and together with rubbish in the remnants of a cellar that was leveled,\" researchers said. In their report, the researchers said the camel was found on the site of what had been an old tavern called \"Auf der Rossmuhle.\" \"The backfill of the cellar yielded masses of domestic refuse like animal bones and ceramics (e.g. plates, pans and flagons), pieces of a tiled stove and enameled pipe bowls which date the filling in the early modern period,\" they said. A coin dating from 1643-1715 and a medicine bottle from a chemist's operating from 1628-1665 helped the team date the site. Flooding and plagues affected Tulln in the 17th century and many buildings were demolished, they said. \"Two building plots got new owners at the end of the century around the 1690, certainly the time when the cellar was backfilled, offering enough space to bury such a big cadaver in the center of the town,\" their report explains. \"The skeleton remained there for more than 300 years to raise questions in the future.\""}

The latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom. It's terrifying. As the investigation unfolds, we will learn more about to what extent Lubitz kept his mental illness secret, or how much help he sought. How much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly? Should he have walked away from his job? Should his doctors have sounded alarm bells? His case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma. Too often and for too long, people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen. When we don't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one, we reinforce a pernicious idea that's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness. Some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help. That's why in our public and more private discourse, people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that doesn't drive some into the darkness. We need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing. And we have to recognize that \"mental illness\" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways. People with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment, many can recover and live healthy, productive lives. We must encourage them to open up, and when they do, we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously. It wasn't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly-kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members, friends and especially employers. But that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer, their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease. Similarly, and with the courageous example of Michael J. Fox, we've seen perceptions about Parkinson's disease change for the better, as people learn more about what it is and isn't. Time to talk about depression . That's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better-informed public discussion. We have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear. That includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place (through laws and regulations like the Americans for Disabilities Act) for individuals who disclose their disability. We also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk. It's a difficult balance. Sooner rather than later, policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people. At the same time, we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities, families and employers. That can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions. If companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society, we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground. We won't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve. But, awful as Germanwings Flight 9525 tragedy was, the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue. We need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness."}

But the name tattooed on his neck -- Gertrude -- gave him away. That's what Kankakee County, Illinois, Sheriff Tim Bukowski said Saturday about Kamron Taylor, the 23-year-old convicted murderer turned jail escapee until his arrest overnight in Chicago. Authorities around Illinois had been looking for Taylor since early Wednesday, when he jumped a correctional officer at Kankakee's Jerome Combs Detention Center, then took off with the guard's uniform and SUV. Surveillance video was the last officials saw of Taylor until just before midnight Friday, in Chicago. \"They saw a guy that matched the description,\" Bukowski said. \"And if you're in law enforcement very long, you just get a feeling that something's not right. ... I think that's what happened.\" The suspect ran five city blocks before being tracked down, carrying a loaded handgun. He didn't go easily, refusing to identify himself. But when Chicago police contacted their law enforcement counterparts about 60 miles south in Kankakee County and told them about the tattoo, it became clearer who the man was. As Bukowski said of the Gertrude tattoo, \"It's not a common name to have around your neck.\" Fingerprints later confirmed that Chicago police had indeed caught up with Taylor. While not offering details beyond that no one is thought to have driven him north nor did a tipster call to specify his location, Bukowski did say \"we have some ideas of where he went and how he ended up\" in the Windy City. It wasn't immediately known either when Taylor will return to Kankakee County. But, when he does, the sheriff said the convict will likely face an attempted murder charge for his attack of the jail guard on top of his already extensive criminal history. Murderer overpowers guard, drives off in his SUV . Bukowski said he expects that Taylor will eventually be incarcerated outside Kankakee County, in part because \"you don't want someone to raise\" the idea that guards there might somehow seek retaliation for the attack on one of their own. What the sheriff doesn't want is for Taylor to go free ever again. This is a man, after all, who killed a man in a June 2013 botched robbery, had to be wrestled to the ground by bailiffs after his conviction in late February, then escaped jail after assaulting the guard. \"He's not going to walk down the block again, I don't believe,\" Bukowski said. The assaulted correctional officer remains in an Illinois hospital, where his condition has improved and he's been able to talk to fellow authorities. This qualifies as very good news, given that authorities think Taylor \"believed that he had killed that correctional officer by strangling him\" around 3 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) Wednesday, according to the sheriff. The guard was making his rounds when he was attacked from the side, then severely beaten and choked. Taylor then allegedly disrobed the guard, a military veteran and 10-year employee of the corrections department. The guard was left on the jail floor, going in and out of consciousness, for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard hadn't responded to calls -- found him, the sheriff said. The alleged attacker then walked out of the jail, albeit only after having his identity checked by camera after pushing a button to notify \"master control\" that he wanted to leave. \"We think that because he had the officer's uniform on,\" the sheriff explained this week, \"that's how he was able to effectively escape.\" Now that Taylor is once again locked up, the focus has shifted more to how he left in the first place. Opining that the escape wouldn't have occurred \"if everybody had followed protocol,\" Bukowski said it's believed the inmate wasn't in his cell at lockdown. \"That's where the big mistake happened,\" the sheriff said. \"Someone missed that. And from that point on, things broke down.\" CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report."}

Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, 29, was deported from Pakistan to the United States. He's accused of plotting to fight against American forces abroad, according to a complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. \"This is news for celebration,\" said CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd. \"Pretty simple reason why: If you look at a case like this, I think most Americans would say the significance of this case is that this guy, an American, is going to come back home and conduct an attack. Instead, you should look at him as a ... facilitator. \"He's not going to burn himself by coming back. He's going to serve as the conduit or known in Pakistan who understands the West, how you travel, how you stay out of the clutches of law enforcement and he also understands al Qaeda in Pakistan. Those people are really hard to come by. This is a great catch not because he was a potential bomber but because he could have trained tens of bombers.\" Farekh's court appearance comes on the same day that federal prosecutors announced the arrests of two New York women accused of planning to build an explosive device for an attack on U.S. soil. The women, identified as Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in a plot inspired by the terrorist group ISIS and others to build a weapon of mass destruction, according to a criminal complaint. They are both U.S. citizens and were roommates in the borough of Queens. Farekh allegedly departed from Canada and headed to Pakistan with two other men in 2007 with the intention of fighting American forces abroad, prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. \"Given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving, how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving, homeland security is becoming a matter of 'hometown security,' \" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. \"The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated. It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet.\" A Texas native, Farekh and his co-conspirators allegedly conspired to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda from 2006 to 2009, according to the complaint. Their intention, according to court documents: To kill and attempt to kill U.S. government employees and military personnel abroad. \"Al Farekh allegedly provided material support to terrorists with every intention of becoming a martyr,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Diego Rodriguez said in a statement. \"Today, members of our military are safer.\" When Farekh, another man named Ferid Imam and a third co-conspirator left Canada for Pakistan in 2007, they did not inform their families of their plans, court documents said. The three men were enrolled as students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Prosecutors said they called a friend in Canada after arriving in Pakistan to say that they would not be heard from again because they were becoming martyrs. In September 2008, Imam allegedly provided weapons and other military training at an al Qaeda camp in Pakistan to three men -- Najibullah Zazi, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin. The trio had planned to return to the United States to carry out a suicide attack on the New York subway, according to prosecutors. Zazi and Ahmedzay have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors. They have not been sentenced. Medunjanin was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Imam has been indicted for his role in the plot. If convicted, Farekh faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. His next court date is May 2."}

His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. \"People were hiding in shelters under the ground,\" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. \"They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible.\" \"[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,\" Margolin remembers. \"They attacked us and we fought back.\" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. \"A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,\" Margolin says. \"A missile fell. I remember.\" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. \"The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,\" says Liora. \"This is the safest place.\" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. \"No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place.\" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, \"We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go.\" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. \"Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust.\" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget. The voices of Auschwitz ."}

The letter is intended to persuade the guardians of the Capitol that I am not a threat and that shooting me down will be a bigger headache than letting me deliver these letters to Congress.\" Hughes' friend Michael Shanahan told CNN that Hughes called him Wednesday morning and told him to check out the website. Although the post is not signed, he lists an email address of \"dhughes@thedemocracyclub.org,\" and the information in his self-description matches information about Hughes in public records. He refers to having multiple children -- the youngest an 11-year-old daughter -- and grandchildren as well. It's unclear exactly when the post published. Shanahan told CNN that when he searched for the site Wednesday morning, he was unable to find it. \"The purpose of it was to call attention to the United States concerning our campaign finance laws, or the lack thereof,\" Shanahan told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. Hughes had his first appearance in court scheduled for Thursday. On Wednesday, he took off in his gyrocopter from Maryland and traveled through restricted airspace over Washington, landing on the Capitol's West Lawn.  Inside the small personal aircraft he had letters for every member of Congress urging campaign finance reform. \"There's no need to worry --  I'm just delivering the mail,\" Hughes wrote in his post. The incident shut down the Capitol for part of the day. Hughes' main purpose \"was not so much to alert Congress to something they already know, but to make a statement, so that America would take notice,\" Shanahan said. The two men together run a website and nonprofit corporation called The Civilist Papers, which focuses on such issues, Shanahan said. In his post, Hughes wrote of his time spent in the Navy and described his family. Although he did not mention it in the post, one of Hughes' sons committed suicide 2 ½  years ago at the age of 24, the Tampa Bay Times reported. \"Something changed in me,\" Hughes told the paper. Public records show Hughes had a son named John Joseph Hughes who died. \"He told us that he felt like his son did something stupid, but he had made a point,\" said Ben Montgomery, the Tampa Bay Times reporter who broke the story of the gyrocopter flight. \"He learned a lesson out of that. And it was: If you want to make a point, you've got to do something big, as sad as that seems,\" Montgomery told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"He's been thinking about this for 2½ years. He's pictured every scenario you could possibly imagine,\" Montgomery said. Shanahan said Hughes mentioned the idea when the two were brainstorming a couple of years ago. Having grown up in Washington, Shanahan opposed the idea. \"I told him that, no, that was an insane plan because the chances are he was going to get killed.\" \"Doug is like a pit bull when he gets an idea,\" Shanahan said.  \"He's very stubborn. And he finds ways around it. ... The word got out because he was telling people of his idea. And the Secret Service heard of it. So, they interviewed the two of us.  And after that, he said he was going to sell his copter and figure out something else to do. But then I noticed he did not sell this copter.\" When Hughes called Shanahan on Wednesday morning, Shanahan said he did not try to talk Hughes out of the plan, but \"he was talking real quick, and I didn't know exactly what he meant by a lot of things.\""}

It was 2007, and a young girl my wife mentored was found rooting through the trash just to find something to eat. That inspired me to found Food Policy Action and become politically active in a range of food issues, from hunger to factory farms. Of course, I haven't been alone in this work. One of the biggest catalysts has been \"The Meatrix,\" a 2003 animation parody based on \"The Matrix\" and produced by the GRACE Communications Foundation, which crystallized the public health risks and environmental harms of factory farming. Recently, \"The Meatrix: Relaunched\" came out. Much more than a comical redux, it's an important benchmark in the evolution of the sustainable food movement and compels us to look back at how far we've come over the last decade -- and how far we still have to go. A decade ago, concepts like \"sustainable farming,\" \"animal welfare\" and \"organic food\" were considered fringe. While some consumers were beginning to take interest in where their meat and produce came from, public knowledge of sustainable food was limited. The standard gut-wrenching images of animal cruelty and sickly calves were ineffectual and mostly turned people off instead of urging them to make better food choices. Meanwhile, factory farms continued to reap large profits while producing subpar meat, polluting air and water resources, and damaging the public's health. To be sure, America's food system is complex, and some may argue that industrial farming has been a necessity to meet our country's food needs. However, the quality of our food has been sacrificed at this supposed altar of necessity, as industrial farms reap enormous profits that they direct toward lobbying rather than improving the quality of food they produce. In 2014 alone, the biggest meatpackers and their trade groups spent a combined $4.3 million on lobbyists. And it has paid off for them: Factory farms often avoid penalties for the damage they cause to the environment and public health; and they receive ridiculous subsidies from the U.S. government that totaled $58.7 million in 2012, according to the Environmental Working Group. These factors drive down the cost of industrially sourced meat at a rate that smaller farms can't keep up with. And since the actual costs of industrially raised meat are hidden, humanely raised meat appears expensive by comparison. That's neither fair nor safe. We all deserve to know where the food we eat comes from and that it is wholesome, and we need our elected officials to take a stand against big agri-businesses to quit letting them profit off of meat and produce that jeopardize the health of the environment and the public. It's time that consumer demand for sustainable and humane food trumps the power that industrial farms hold over our elected officials. The original \"Meatrix\" cartoon used pop culture references and family-friendly cartoons to educate consumers about the dangers of factory farming, compel them to make better food choices and spark a wave of online advocacy for better government oversight of big agriculture and meat companies. As a result, it became one of the first viral videos ever to effectively expose consumers to the realities happening behind the doors of industrial farms and the damage these facilities were doing to the environment, our public health and surrounding communities. The rise in consumer knowledge has led to an increased demand for sustainably sourced food that is healthier and tastes better. GRACE has relaunched the Eat Well Guide, an online directory of 25,000 sustainable farms, restaurants, food co-ops and farmers' markets that allows consumers to make better choices about the food they eat and provide for their families. And we at Food Policy Action have produced a legislative scorecard. We need to ask members of Congress to promote sustainable farming, not factory farms. We need them to support sensible food policies that ensure that everyone has access to food and water. Congress should vote against the DARK Act, which would block any federal or state action that required labels for foods made with genetically engineered ingredients even at the expense of the environment, public health and local economies. As more consumers are educated, they have the power to take action and call on elected officials to support sustainable farmers, not factory farms. Together, we can create a sustainable food system in America that is better for our environment and our health."}

The special forces were on the ground in noncombat roles \"coordinating and guiding\" the battle against Houthi forces and fighters loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the source said. They also have helped parachute in weapons and communications equipment. Houthi rebels, meanwhile, withdrew from the presidential palace and other key parts of the southern port city of Aden following heavy Saudi airstrikes, according to the source. The withdrawal signaled a reversal from rebel gains the previous day, when Houthi forces seized the presidential palace. President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. Houthis had controlled most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. The latest action heats up an already intense conflict that could have ramifications across the Middle East. If the Saudi-led coalition of nine countries takes the fight to the ground in Yemen, the consequences could be severe. Houthis are battle-hardened guerrilla fighters and could cross into Saudi Arabia. They've already threatened suicide bomb attacks inside Saudi Arabia. Yemen, already the home base to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state and an even more fertile breeding ground for extremism. The United Nations, citing reports from humanitarian partners, said 519 people have been killed and nearly 1,700 others wounded in the past two weeks. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes and sought refuge in Djibouti and Somalia, Valerie Amos, under-secretary-general and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement. Two humanitarian workers were killed Friday in Yemen. The brothers working for the local branch of the Yemen Red Crescent Society were shot in Aden while evacuating wounded people to a waiting ambulance, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported. They were identified as Khaled Ahmed Bahuzaim and Mohammed Ahmed Bahuzaim. Two Saudi border guards were killed Friday after an exchange of fire with Houthi rebels along the kingdom's frontier with Yemen, officials told CNN. A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants, the Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday. That marked Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. U.S. Navy warships were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN on Thursday. The Navy this week came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a \"vessel of interest\" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen last week, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Houthi rebels are Shiite Muslims who have taken over Sanaa and had captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Sunni Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. Officials: Al Qaeda fighters free 270 from Yemeni prisons .

Early Wednesday morning, Taylor sat in an Illinois jail. Hiding outside his cell. Ready to pounce. When he did, his victim was a correctional officer making his rounds, according to Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. Taylor beat up the guard, put on his uniform and took his keys. He then walked out of the jail's door and into the officer's brown 2012 Chevrolet Equinox SUV. Where the 23-year-old, who was set to be sentenced in May, is now is anybody's guess. The Equinox was discovered around 8:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET) in Kankakee, but without any sign of the convicted murderer who drove it. Looking for Taylor is job No. 1 for authorities. No. 2 is figuring out how he managed to first get out of his cell, then get out of the Jerome Combs Detention Center and on the lam. \"The question for us is where did (the county correctional system) break down,\" Bukowski said. \"It looks right now (like) somebody didn't do their job properly.\" What authorities do know is based on video, other evidence and interviews with witnesses -- namely other inmates at the Kankakee jail. What they don't know is how Taylor got out of his two-man cell, when he should have been locked down. But somehow he did, and hid. \"And then when the opportunity arose, he attacked the officer,\" Bukowski said, noting that Taylor \"attacked from the side\" around 3 a.m. \"Beat him, choked him.\" He then apparently disrobed the guard, a military veteran and 10-year employee of the corrections department. The guard was left on the jail floor, going in and out of consciousness, for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard hadn't responded to calls -- found him, the sheriff said. \"They then called the ambulance and we were notified and put out an alert,\" added Bukowski. By then, Taylor was gone. He'd pushed a button to notify \"master control\" that he wanted to leave, which means his identity would have been checked by camera. \"We think that because he had the officer's uniform on,\" the sheriff explained, \"that's how he was able to effectively escape.\" Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox. That officer is now in an intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Kankakee, Bukowski said. The manhunt, meanwhile, continues for Taylor. He has a history of trouble with the law that predates his murder conviction, including an August 2009 sentence of five years, 10 months in Tennessee for robbery and resisting arrest. Taylor was on parole for that crime when he killed a man during a June 2013 botched robbery. A jury convicted him of murder in that incident in late February. After the verdict was read, Taylor sat down, looked back, then got up and ran, according to The Daily Journal in Kankakee. Bailiffs and sheriff's deputies wrestled him to the ground, eventually leading him out of the courtroom as he cursed. Now a $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his arrest. The fact that he tried to get away once before and has been involved in fights \"raises an alert, I guess,\" the Kankakee County sheriff said. \"But we figure that the people who are locked up in our facility aren't altar boys, and we take certain precautions for all of them,\" Bukowski added. \"And you can't become complacent with anybody, especially murderers.\" CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 957, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)As we approach April 27 when South Africa marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994, we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against African migrants. Outrage triggered by this violence is being heard loudly throughout social media with \"#WeAreAfrica\" showcasing the need for a common front against this affront. These recurring attacks against migrants and their property might be read as one more indication of how the rainbow nation's dream has faltered. That vision not only symbolized a multi-ethnic South Africa, but one where living in dignity is shared across racial and class lines. Attacks against newcomers in South Africa are often reduced to attitudes of hate and resentment towards other black Africans. The national and international headlines use \"xenophobia\" as if any one word can convey the multifaceted crisis within which this phenomenon occurs. Labeling this turmoil as xenophobic fails to convey the conditions in which African migrants are scapegoated for the persistent legacy of apartheid in the post-liberation era. This word also does not tell us that extreme poverty now exceeds that experienced under apartheid. And it certainly does not account for how extreme inequality is now fully embraced and normalized by a new black elite joining the \"white-haves\" of yesteryear. The question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam, as if the majority of black citizens and African migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white South Africans or white foreigners. Contact between the majority of African migrant groups and native black South Africans mostly occurs in under-developed informal settlements and townships. In the interaction and competition between these groups in these spaces, we need to be wary of the simplistic treatment of South Africa's ailment as xenophobia. Such labeling does not and cannot explain the totality of the contact, competition and conflict between native poor black South Africans and foreign African entrepreneurs. Attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of South Africa's black majority experiences segregation, persistent and relative poverty, and high crime rates in post-apartheid South Africa is paramount. Neglecting access to social rights, such as water, electricity, education and other services, is tantamount to violence by political leaders against the poor. Condemning and prosecuting those who incite violence is essential to maintaining law and order and protecting those vulnerable because of their nationality. But the evictions, harassment and ultimately brutal killings of foreigners cannot and should not be separated from the daily brutal violence poor South Africans in informal settlements and many townships experience. It cannot and should not be separated from South Africa's status as one of the most unequal societies in the world; it cannot and should not be separated from the fact that South Africa has one of the highest homicide levels in the world. A mantra of xenophobia wishes away the fact that the everyday lives of those in vulnerable positions in this society (the poor, the disabled, women, children, the elderly) are filled with violence similar -- if not worse -- than that facing African foreigners eking out a living in the midst of abject poverty. Labeling South Africa's poor blacks as ungrateful and amnesiac to the history of hospitality other Africans bestowed on their exiles under apartheid does a disservice to both the local poor whose citizenship rights are marginal at best and the resilient migrants in search of asylum and dignity. Such labeling only serves politicians and the elites who are sealed off by barbed wire surrounded by a security industry that outspends and outnumbers South Africa's police force. It allows corruption to persist while the political leaders who are implicated in this violence scapegoat \"criminal youth\" to further fill an overflowing prison industry. Religious and civil society leaders' recent mobilization saying \"not in our name\" in reaction to violence against migrants should be applauded. But religious, civil society and student groups also have an obligation to organize and denounce the inequality and the violence that is the everyday lot of the extremely poor in South Africa. Pervasive misery and corruption in the midst of a nation with so much potential should not be tolerated. Neither a hashtag of outrage #WeAreAfrica nor the expedience of the label \"xenophobia\" can wish away the angst, violence and the impending crisis in South Africa. Migrants' security and dignity is part and parcel of a greater security and dignity for all South Africans, which seem deferred for now."}
{"tokens_range": "1k", "total_prompt_tokens": 932, "how_many_news": 1, "source": "cnn-dailymail-3.0.0-test", "content": "(CNN)Back in 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini famously said he was \"drinking poison\" when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with Iraq.  The war had helped define Khomeini's regime, the Islamic Republic, which he had founded a year before Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. Khomeini galvanized the nation, both his supporters and growing opponents, to fight against the enemy. He dragged out the war for eight years, despite Saddam's willingness to accept a ceasefire, and thus stabilized the foundations of the Islamic Republic. By the time he ended the war, the economy was in shambles, and there was no sign of his die-hard volunteers. Since then, \"drinking a chalice of poison\" has became part of Iranian political lexicon, and many analysts have asked whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the West to end Iran's nuclear program. Like the war, Iran's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined Khameni's era. He has defied the West in the face of increasing economic pressure. Iran claims that its program is peaceful, but Khamenei's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions. The standoff with the West has stretched longer than the war. The agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, however, marks a new chapter in the history of the country. If Iran can finalize a deal by June with the United States and its P5+1 partners, international investors, including Americans, would be able to invest in Iran for the first time in decades. Iran can develop its gas and oil fields, and the economy can leap forward. Desperate for a deal, whoever I called over the past week inside Iran was glued to their television sets, and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late Thursday night. Iran's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the Rial, the Iranian currency, plunged to one-third of the U.S. dollar. Inflation soared and the bank accounts of ordinary Iranians were frozen overseas as a result of sanctions. Millions of Iranians are hoping that their lives will improve in the post-deal era. Despite the regime's propaganda that claimed the program enjoys wide support among people, critics inside the country publicly denounced nuclear policies. Ahmad Shirzad, a former member of parliament, denounced the program last year and said it had been \"against national interests.\" Another critic, Sadeq Ziba, said in December \"the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war.\" Iranian politicians are divided between moderates -- led by President Hassan Rouhani, who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners, who view the deal as a threat to the regime's ideology. The majority of people brought Rouhani to power in 2012, hoping that he would ease the sanctions. Many see the negotiations as a diplomatic necessity that would help sideline hardliners too. Yet the Lausanne agreement would not have been possible without the moderates' will and Khamenei's approval. Ayatollah Khamenei is 76. Last year, he underwent a long prostate surgery, which led to rumors that he might be gravely ill. His predecessor ended the war a year before his death. Whether Khamenei is seriously ill or not, many believe that because of his advanced age, he needs to put the country on a straight path before his death. So far, the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself. During 18 months of negotiations, the regime appeared determined not to succumb to Western demands and lose its right to uranium enrichment. The Lausanne agreement allows Iran to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation. Khamenei can claim that Iran is the winner in the country's decade-long confrontation with the West -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind. He has not drunk the poison yet, not until June, when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal. But perhaps he has raised the chalice."}

Indeed, U.S. access to space has provided incredible benefit to U.S. national security, defense and the economic well-being of the nation. And in order to effectively confront current and future conflicts, combat terrorism and counter the proliferating threats worldwide, our military depends on space-based capabilities, including intelligence, GPS, and communications satellites. Unfortunately, as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates, the U.S. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on Russian technology to meet our national security obligations. How? For a start, we depend on the Atlas V rocket, which carries many of our most important satellites and is powered by the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine. The fact that we rely on Russia, currently under sanctions for invading a sovereign nation, should reinforce the need for a change in our current course. Assured access to space is an area where the U.S. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains, which are subject to disruption, threats, unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the U.S. The Ukraine crisis should have served as a wake-up call, highlighting the danger of dependence on Russia to launch national security satellites into space. And the United States should play no part in supporting the defense industry of a country that continues to abrogate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Simply put, it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements, and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to U.S. national security interests. Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defense and space industries, has called American taxpayer outlays for the Russian engine \"free money\" that goes directly back into Russia's missile modernization programs. It is high time the U.S. government turn to its existing domestic capability and turn off this flow of funds. Fortunately, there are some signs of progress. Last year, Congress took bipartisan action to phase out reliance on the RD-180 engine by the end of the decade, and to transition to an all-American space launch capability. The defense authorization for fiscal year 2015 included restrictions on the future use of the RD-180 for the Atlas V, authorizing $220 million to begin development of a U.S. alternative. This was a wise move, but it's not enough. There are steps that the United States can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world. True, development of a new launch system will take time; there are no overnight answers. However, a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the U.S. space program. Indeed, new entrants are coming online using launch vehicle systems fully designed and manufactured in America. The two main launch competitors -- United Launch Alliance and SpaceX -- each have all-American systems, namely ULA's Delta IV family of rockets and SpaceX's Falcon 9. Having both options will put America on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation, while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the Cold War. The short-term goal should be to transition to existing American-manufactured launch vehicles, as opposed to phasing out systems such as the Delta IV, which continue to provide critical capability. In the long term, next-generation development programs should not involve major Russian subsystems and components. It is time to end America's reliance on Russia's rocket engine. This would be good for national security, good for American innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country's future."}

The 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner survived an attack by the Taliban, which had singled her out for blogging from Pakistan about the importance of staying in school. In the letter, she calls on the Nigerian government and the international community to do more to rescue the girls.  Nigeria recently held an election. On April 14, 2014, Islamists with Boko Haram kidnapped the girls, prompting an international campaign for their safe return, which used the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.  On Monday, UNICEF announced a new campaign for the 800,000 children who have been displaced in northeast Nigeria, using the hashtag #BringBackOurChildhood. Malala is admired globally as a figure standing for peace.  On Sunday, a NASA astrophysicist named an asteroid after her. She has spoken with CNN about the Nigerian abductions previously. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . Here is the full letter: . To my brave sisters, the kidnapped schoolgirls of Chibok, . On this first anniversary of your captivity, I write to you with a message of solidarity, love and hope. My name is Malala. I am a Pakistani girl your age. I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers. We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you. We will always stand with you. Today and every day, we call on the Nigerian authorities and the international community to do more to bring you home. We will not rest until you have been reunited with your families. Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school. Gunmen shot me and two of my friends on a school bus. All three of us survived and are back in school. Now we speak out on behalf of all girls about the right to get a proper education. Our campaign will continue until you and all girls and boys around the world are able to access a free, safe and quality secondary education. Last July, I spent my 17th birthday in Nigeria with some of your parents and five of your classmates who escaped the kidnapping. Your parents are grief-stricken. They love you, and they miss you. My father and I wept and prayed with your parents -- and they touched our hearts. The escapee schoolgirls my father and I met impressed us with their resolve to overcome their challenges and to complete their high school education. My father and I promised your parents and the girls who had escaped that we would do all we could to help them. I met Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and urged him to work harder for your freedom. I also asked President Jonathan to meet your parents and the girls who escaped the kidnapping, which he did a few days later. Still, in my opinion, Nigerian leaders and the international community have not done enough to help you. They must do much more to help secure your release. I am among many people pressuring them to make sure you are freed. There are reasons for hope and optimism. Nigerian forces are re-gaining territory and protecting more schools. Nigeria's newly-elected president, Muhammadu Buhari, has vowed to make securing your freedom a top priority and promised his government will not tolerate violence against women and girls. \"You will have the opportunity to receive the education you want and deserve. The Malala Fund and other organizations offered all your classmates who escaped the kidnapping full scholarships to complete their secondary education. Most of the escapee girls accepted this scholarship and are now continuing their studies at a safe boarding school and with the support they need. We hope to someday extend that same scholarship to all 219 of you, when you return home. Remember that one day your tragic ordeal will end, you will be reunited with your families and friends, and you will have the chance to finish the education you courageously sought. I look forward to the day I can hug each one of you, pray with you, and celebrate your freedom with your families. Until then, stay strong, and never lose hope. You are my heroes. Your sister, . Malala ."}

Although edgy hardliners may now try to play games and complain the preliminary agreement is not what they had hoped, for many people it shows excellent progress and that's what they want. It paves the way for a much broader deal by end of June that guarantees the peaceful nature of Tehran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community. As is, the stakes are high and the choice is clear for President Hassan Rouhani and his \"moderate\" administration. They must now be over the moon: In early 2016, there will be Legislative and Assembly of Experts elections, the latter of which elects the country's leader. This historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections. So far, Rouhani's team has done nothing to improve the living conditions of ordinary Iranians who complain they have lost half of their purchasing power in recent years. READ MORE: Will Iran's Supreme Leader drink 'poison' of peace? During his presidential campaign, he promised to do so \"only\" if he could seal a nuclear deal with the world powers. And now he has. A full deal ultimately represents a referendum on the Rouhani administration's foreign policy. It will definitely strengthen his hand, which he needs to stay in the game, or better yet, win the next presidential race. The good news is that people are more than happy to welcome the preliminary agreement. They had always wanted a way out of the current impasse with the rest of the world and as a reward they could keep the moderates in power for the foreseeable future. Iranians blame sanctions and the previous hardline government for the sorry state of affairs in the economy -- especially the way they so poorly handled past nuclear talks of the past -- with devastating consequences. Many believe that now there is a joint comprehensive plan of action -- the culmination of a 12-year process -- there is something to hope for. In many respects, it's a new beginning and that allows Iranians a very small degree of hope inside themselves too. Looking back, the previous government traded those expectations for international isolation and economic hardship. Despite skepticism, even the country's leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, now feels that the light at the end of the tunnel might not be a train and that the talks could end well. READ MORE: What's in the Iran nuclear deal? 7 key points . Little wonder he had urged the nation -- including the well-funded hardliners -- to support the government's overture, saying the negotiating team was trustworthy and had been doing a fine job. It was a historic gesture that represents qualified support for continued diplomacy and that could lead to a historic step forward. It places confidence and hope in the negotiating team and the P5+1 group of world powers, guaranteeing no-one in Iran will stand in the way of principled diplomatic engagement and international rapprochement. Within this context, many Iranians are jubilant. They should be. More than ever, they are confident that not striking a comprehensive deal would be a historic mistake. They are confident it is within reach and this is as it should be: A win-win deal for all. They now strongly believe the lifting of international sanctions is no longer illusive. It would resuscitate the country's ailing economy and improve their lives. At least, that's what they hope. It's early spring and people on the streets are talking about nothing but the current choice. It represents the biggest chance of rapprochement between Tehran and Washington since the Iranian revolution in 1979. After all, for many Iranians this is more than just a nuclear agreement."}

Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area. \"They slaughtered them in the streets,\" one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. \"They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp.\" An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in \"the deepest circle of hell,\" in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups. Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go. Hundreds have been injured, but the camp's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling. As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived. \"We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities,\" Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. \"The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there's really nothing functioning.\" Opinion: Save the 'miracle babies' Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation's water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups. The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help. \"According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014\" during the Syrian regime's siege of the camp, the PLHR's Salim Salamah told CNN. Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government's stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands. But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death. \"Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime,\" the Yarmouk resident told CNN. \"The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp,\" he said. \"And ISIS, I don't know ... they didn't do anything except [rename] Yarmouk Camp as 'Yarmouk Islamic State.'\""}

Join a demonstration? How long could you keep going for, in the face of indifference and inaction? When more than 200 Nigerian girls were kidnapped from their school a year ago by Boko Haram militants, millions of people around the world joined a social media campaign to plead for their safe return. Charles Alasholuyi was one of those people -- from celebrities to world leaders -- voicing their anger via #BringBackOurGirls, one of the top Twitter hashtags of 2014, used in more than four million tweets. But as weeks turned into months, there was still no sign of the missing girls. The spotlight on the campaign faded. People stopped tweeting. They stopped marching. They stopped pleading with the Nigerian government to do more to rescue the young students. It seemed everyone had given up hope that the girls would come back. Many questioned whether they were even still alive. Everyone, that is, except Alasholuyi. The marketing professional and father-of-three has taken time nearly every single day since the girls went missing to hold up a sign featuring the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag, have his colleague take his photo with it, and post it on CNN iReport. Alasholuyi, a believer in the saying that \"an injury done to one, is an injury done to all,\" says he does this to help give the families of the girls a voice. He admits his daily routine can be stressful and frustrating and he hopes that one day soon, he will be able to stop doing it. But so far he hasn't dared give up his commitment, saying he feels a moral obligation to continue posting his daily photo until the girls are returned. He says he doesn't want anyone to forget about them and the struggles their families are facing every day the girls are missing. #BringBackOurGirls one year on: 'We should all feel shame' Alasholuyi adds messages on the signs like \"over 200 stolen dreams,\" \"save the girls now\" and \"our government has a responsibility to protect us all.\" Over the past year, he has also worked with organizations who are holding the Nigerian government accountable, demanding they do more to find the girls. Most recently, he participated in a 10-kilometer march through Lagos. He has also met local leaders to highlight the need for girls to be able to get an education without the fear of being abducted. Malala's letter to the abducted schoolgirls . Alasholuyi has also appealed to his government  -- and other nations -- to fight the violence imposed by Boko Haram which has carried out multiple attacks and abductions since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. \"Yesterday was Chibok, the day before yesterday it was somewhere in the north, today it could be another town. Tomorrow it could be my village,\" he said. \"Why not cry out loud now for the whole world to come to our aid and make sure that the Boko Haram insurgency and their senseless abductions are nipped in the bud.\" He told CNN he believes the newly-elected government, which is due to take office on May 29, will step up efforts to locate the girls. He is confident president elect Muhammadu Buhari, the country's newly-elected president and a retired Major General in the Nigerian Army, will do more to combat the threat of Boko Haram. Alasholuyi says he believes in miracles and hopes his passion, commitment and determination to help the Chibok girls through his daily photos will one day bring them home safely.

According to a criminal complaint, Tsarnaeva threatened a woman in a phone call this summer, saying \"Leave my man alone.\" \"Stop looking for him. ... I know people that can put a bomb where you live,\" she said, according to the complaint. Considering who was making the threats, prosecutors didn't consider it a joke and charged Tsarnaeva with aggravated harassment, which she denies. Leaving court last December, she and her lawyer refused to discuss the case. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial. Tsarnaev's lawyers don't dispute that he did it. The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older, self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror. Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial . The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. The parents, fleeing a troubled region of Russia, were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare. The state of Massachusetts has confirmed the Tsarnaevs received food stamps, public housing and other aid, on and off, between 2002 and 2012. During this time, Tamerlan Tsarnaev began his conversion to radical Islam. Then, according to investigators, he began filling his younger brother's head with a hatred toward the West. Not much is known about the two Tsarnaeva daughters, Ailina, 24, and Bella, 26, though their last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey. Along with charges of making bomb threats, Ailina Tsarnaeva has a past record that includes misleading police in a counterfeiting case. She pleaded guilty but got no jail time. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident, but that charge was dismissed. Her older sister, Bella, was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute after a 2012 arrest, and she entered a pretrial intervention program. Even their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, has had issues with the law. She fled back to Russia in 2012, where she remains a fugitive. Records show that she was arrested in June 2012 for allegedly shoplifting $1,600 worth of women's clothing from a Boston-area Lord & Taylor department store. She is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her in 2011 at the same time they asked the United States about her son Tamerlan, several sources told CNN shortly after the 2013 attack. U.S. authorities added the mother and son to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half-million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of the investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. The radicalization of Tsarnaev . In Russia, she has maintained her innocence in the shoplifting case while also calling the charges against her sons \"made up.\" Though not elaborating on her beliefs, Ailina Tsarnaeva has said she believes, as her mother does, that her surviving brother Dzhokhar and her dead brother Tamerlan are innocent. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, faces 30 criminal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction causing death. On Tuesday, one day after federal prosecutors rested after calling more than 90 witnesses, defense lawyers rested their case without calling Tsarnaev to the stand. Closing arguments are expected Monday. Tsarnaev attorney: 'It was him' Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET. For the latest from Erin Burnett click here."}

A pub landlord convicted of showing Premier League football matches on foreign TV channels has won an eight-year legal battle to clear his name. Michael Thorpe says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result. Mr Thorpe, 55, was convicted of showing a Premier League game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in November 2006 at the Stoke Inn in Plymouth, Devon. He said he could not afford to pay Sky TV's rates for football matches, and opted instead to show Albanian transmissions of matches, which he says he thought was legal. But he was convicted, fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago, when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence. Judge Recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark European court ruling. His appeal took so long as he had to launch the case  after the European Court of Justice found enforcing previous rules was anti-competitive. Mr Thorpe said he was 'overwhelmed' that a judge and magistrates had upheld his appeal after all this time. But it is a bitter-sweet victory, as the long-running dispute cost him his business and his livelihood. He said: 'We put a lot of money into that pub and it went from a thriving business to absolutely zero. People stopped coming to the pub, it cost me my business.' Mr Thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial, but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the European Court of Justice. The court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to European Law. But the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the Stoke Inn in Plymouth which he used to run . Mr Thorpe's appeal was further delayed until another case involving Media Protection Services Ltd, the company which took him to court on behalf of the Premier League, but which no longer does so. Mr Thorpe was awarded his legal costs, which he paid privately, but he would not disclose the sum. The European court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction, but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches. The Premier League has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright, with some ordered to pay up to £65,000 in costs. The league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally. Legal cases have  been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season. He said he does not know whether he can retrieve the £1,000 fine and £1,500 costs ordered by the magistrates. Despite the decision, the Premier League has insisted pubs still cannot show foreign-TV footage of its games. Since the European Court decision, it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws, which were not affected by the previous ruling. In 2012, pub Karen Murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of Sky to show Premier League football matches. Ms Murphy, who ran The Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster Nova for £800 a year instead of Sky, which was then priced at £700-a-month. The Premier League took legal action against her Mrs Murphy and she was fined £8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006. But a European Court of Justice ruling said having an exclusive system of TV rights was contrary to EU law and the High Court overturned her conviction. A recent investigation by trade publication, The Morning Advertiser, quoted a pub landlord saying Sky Sports cost him £16,000-a-year, compared to the £300-per-year of screening it illegally. The decision came after Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy won a European court battle over her conviction. Despite the ruling, the Premier League can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright ."}

Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury. The Brazil international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late November - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team's results - until a groin problem in February's Merseyside derby saw him miss 10 games. He was an unused substitute in the defeat by Manchester United immediately before the international break, their first in the league since mid-December, but played 90 minutes in Sunday's All-Star Charity game at Anfield. Lucas's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment, with captain Steven Gerrard suspended for three matches for his sending off against United, and the Brazilian is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally. 'I was in a very good moment, probably the best moment in the last couple of years, and I had a good run of games,' he said. 'The beginning of the season wasn't good for me because I couldn't play much, but as soon as I got back in the team I think I helped a lot. 'I don't know if Stevie's suspension will change things because the team were playing well, but I need to be ready and there are a lot of games to play and the FA Cup as well, so everyone will be needed. 'I need to be ready and if I get a chance again I need to be at the same level I was before I was injured.' Lucas attempts to spoil Luis's Suarez's return to Anfield with a tackle in the charity match . Fifth-placed Liverpool head to Arsenal on Saturday knowing they cannot realistically afford to lose if they are to keep pace with the top four, but in addition to Gerrard's absence they will also be missing centre-back Martin Skrtel, a virtual ever-present this season, after he was retrospectively banned for standing on United goalkeeper David de Gea. 'Martin is having a fantastic season again. He has been a very consistent player for us and losing him and Stevie is hard to take, but if you want to be successful you can't rely on one or two players,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'Both are very important players for us as one can change a game and the other gives us stability at the back, but we have other players as well who can step in. 'It's always been the case for the group that if someone gets injured then someone will step in and do the job. 'That's how it should be and we shouldn't be afraid we don't have them. 'Of course it's going to be a big miss not having Stevie and Skrts, but we have to show we can cope for the three games and then we have them back ready to go again.' Lucas's spoiling in midfield helped Liverpool go on an impressive run before Christmas . The Brazilian is aiming to take advantage of Gerrard's absence in he next three games . Lucas rejected the chance to have some time off during the international break in order to make sure he was fully fit for the resumption of the Premier League. 'I feel great. Leading up to the Manchester United game I had a full week of training as well, so it's been two weeks of full training,' he said. 'I was available for the Manchester United game, but probably wasn't able to play the whole game. Now I feel 100 per cent. 'Of course it's good to have a few days off, but I was away in Brazil while I was having my treatment so it was the right decision to stay here and keep working during the international break. 'If you get too many days off you don't get the sharpness and the rhythm of the training session and that's what I was missing. 'I spoke with the staff and they prepared everything for me as well to make me feel as though I'm in good condition, so it's looking good and hopefully it will only get better. 'Now it's just a question of getting some minutes and training sessions, so that's what I need and what I'm having. 'Leading into the Arsenal game that's going to be good, because I will have had three full weeks of training and I'm looking forward to it.'"}

Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'"}

Newcastle Crown Court heard that Gordon Robson, 26, hit father John Potts, 45, in the back of the head so hard there was an 'audible crack' before he fell down dead. Robson, who has a history of violent offending, was jailed for just three and a half years for the attack outside the NE38 Sports Bar in Washington, Tyne and Wear, in November last year. The court was told that Robson had been drinking at the bar after being a pallbearer at his grandfather's funeral before getting into an argument with a friend of Mr Potts. Fighting broke out after the bar closed, and Mr Potts, a father-of-six and grandfather-of-one who was described by his sister as 'a big softie', stepped in to stop it. Prosecutor Nick Dry told the court: 'At this point the defendant punched Mr Potts, who had been trying to calm matters down and was actually facing the other way when the blow was struck. 'The punch made a loud crack, witnesses turned to see him falling to the ground, making no attempt to break his fall.' The court heard despite intervention from the emergency services, Mr Potts could not be saved. Mr Dry added: 'Mr Potts had been minding his own business. He was an innocent bystander who sought only to calm the situation down.' Mr Potts' widow Sarah said  his death had a 'devastating impact' on the family. She said Mr Potts' stepchildren and eight-year-old daughter, Emma, now fear their family won't come back whenever they leave the house. Mr Dry added: 'She said he was a father who never judged her, he was just her dad and hero.' Mr Potts' sisters said in their statements the 'life and soul has been ripped from their family' and described their brother as a 'big softie'. Mr Potts' brother George said he wakes every Sunday at 5.30am, the time he was informed of his siblings death, and feels life has been changed forever. Robson had been drinking at the NE38 Sports Bar in Washington, Tyne and Wear, after his grandfather's funeral when fighting broke out. Mr Potts, described as a 'big softie', was killed when he tried to intervene . Judge Paul Sloan QC jailed Robson, of Waskerley Way, Washington, Tyne and Wear, who admitted manslaughter, to three-and-a-half years behind bars. The judge told Robson: 'Mr Potts was trying to calm the situation. He was acting as a peacemaker. 'It is clear Mr Potts was a devoted father and step-father. It is also clear his death has had a profound effect upon his family. 'No sentence imposed upon you could ever serve to ease the pain of Mr Potts' family. 'I accept you are genuinely remorseful and I accept you will carry the guilt with you for the rest of your life for what you did that night.' Robson accepted he 'misinterpreted' Mr Robson's actions that night, when his already emotional state had been heightened by alcohol, and realises now he should not have hit him. Bob Spragg, defending, said Robson, who has a history of violent offending dating back to when he was just 14, had turned his life around after his last prison sentence . He added that Robson had also found himself a partner who is about to give birth. Mr Spragg said: 'Absolutely no blame attaches to Mr Potts for anything that happened to him. 'Once the defendant has served his sentence he will return to being a law abiding citizen but will have to live with what he has done for the rest of his life.'"}

The hosts had led through first-half goals by Robert Tesche and Clayton Donaldson, before Matt Derbyshire pulled one back for fourth-bottom Rotherham. However, Rob Kiernan's clumsy handling of Derbyshire near the hour mark saw the former City forward go down in the box only for referee Dean Whitestone to wave away appeals for a spot-kick, leaving the Millers boss visibly enraged as the home side held out.

Andrew Shinnie was unfortunate to be flagged offside from Donaldson's early flick-on while winger Demarai Gray's ball into the box from the left was dangerous but fruitless. David Cotterill forced a good low save from Emiliano Martinez with a drive from just outside the area in the 19th minute as Gary Rowett's side continued to press. The deadlock was broken in the 27th minute with a well-worked but uncomplicated attack. Tesche found space just outside the box and after a one-two with Donaldson, side-footed coolly into the bottom-right corner to leave Martinez with no chance. Shinnie headed Cotterill's excellent cross over in the 38th minute after Donaldson's slight touch beforehand slightly changed the flight of the ball but eventually the second did come two minutes before the break. Cotterill hit a free-kick from distance with trademark power and accuracy and when Martinez palmed it back into play, rather than for a corner, Donaldson pounced with an easy diving header.

Birmingham City's David Cotterill holds off challenge from Rotherham United's Ben Pringle (right) Donaldson fired a decent effort over on the turn as Blues sensed blood before the half was over. Rotherham gained a foothold less than three minutes into the second half, however. Slack defensive play left City goalkeeper Darren Randolph in bother and when he only palmed Lee Frecklington's shot to Derbyshire, the deficit was halved as the striker tapped home with ease. Frecklington then had a chance saved as Randolph kept out a deflected effort, while Martinez reacted quickly as Donaldson broke through at the other end. Colourful Millers boss Evans was incandescent with rage on the hour mark when his side were denied a penalty, with Derbyshire bearing down on goal only to go down when tangling with home defender Kiernan as the centre-half looked to atone for an error seconds earlier. Derbyshire was not far off with a 76th-minute header, while Donaldson and substitute Lloyd Dyer both came agonisingly close at point-blank range and Tesche twice fired straight at Martinez as the home side missed numerous chances to make the win more comfortable."}

The 6ft 7in, 17st-plus Tilse has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the Robins and will join them as soon as he receives the necessary paperwork after the Raiders agreed to release him. Tilse, 30, who has made 200 appearances Down Under, will link up with his old Canberra team-mate Terry Campese, the new Hull KR captain who on Tuesday signed a two-year contract extension, and is a like-for-like replacement for Weyman, who announced his retirement due to injury last month. Australian forward Dane Tilse will move from Canberra Raiders to Hull KR on a two-and-a-half-year deal . The Raiders have agreed to release the 6ft 7in forward and only paperwork delays his start for the Robins . Rovers, who have appointed former England captain Jamie Peacock as their football manager for 2016, were further depleted in the front row when they agreed to release ex-Leeds prop Bailey for personal reasons. Tilse comes in after the sudden retirement of Michael Weyman and Ryan Bailey's departure . Hull KR head coach Chris Chester, who had been linked with a move for Tilse's Canberra team-mate David Shillington, said: 'It's no secret that we've been short on numbers in the front row after the departures of Mick and Ryan Bailey and we wanted to strengthen in that area. 'Our forwards have coped very well in the circumstances but we've been scouring the market for props and we're delighted to be bringing in someone of Dane's calibre. 'He's got a very good pedigree over in the NRL and he's coming here in what should be the prime of his career for a front rower. 'We're excited to see him take to the field for us and he'll be a big part of the squad moving forwards. We've got to go through the necessary process regarding his visa, but we're hopeful of having him on board in the next three to four weeks.' Tilse, a former Junior Kangaroo who was an ever-present for Canberra in both 2013 and 2014, said he spoke to former Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson, who joined the Raiders at the end of last season, before finalising the move. 'It's a new challenge for me to come over there and it's one I'm really looking forward to,' Tilse said. 'Everybody I've spoken to has had good things to say about Rovers and it sounds like a club on the way up. 'I've had a brief chat to Josh Hodgson and he spoke very highly of the club, as did Mick Weyman's dad. I played with Mick at Canberra and his old man said how much he'd enjoyed it over there. Tilse will link up with his former Raiders team-mate Terry Campese, the new Hull KR captain . 'It's a different style of game in Super League, it's not so much about the wrestle and defence like the NRL, so I'm looking forward to a fresh start. 'I've been at Canberra for 10 years now and it's time for me to be taken out of my comfort zone, but I'm 30 years old, I'm an experienced player and I'm more than confident I can handle the change. 'I was already thinking of coming over to Super League next season, but this was too good an opportunity to turn down. 'Canberra have been really good with me, so hopefully I can play a couple more games here over the next few weeks and then get across to Hull KR.'"}

The former Premier League defender said he had 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. Mr Carlisle tried to kill himself in December, two days after he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. Scroll down for video . Split: Clarke Carlisle says he has 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. The pair are pictured together in 2013 . The 35-year-old father-of-three stepped in front of a 12-ton truck on the A64 near York in December, suffering cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. The incident has left the ex-Burnley defender with scars all over his body. On television this week Mr Carlisle, who has publicly struggled with depression, revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Now Mr Carlisle, who played 131 times for the Clarets between 2007 and 2012, said the accident had led to him moving out of the house he shared with wife Gemma. The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002, told TalkSport Radio on a special Monday night show: 'At this point, Gemma and I have separated. 'I have moved out of the marital home because I have to focus on my well-being and equally as much Gemma has to do the same. 'She has to deal with her experiences and the effect that has had on her.' Mr Carlisle appeared on Good Morning Britain this week and revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving . Asked about how his wife Gemma has taken it, he added: 'Every day has been incredibly tough and different. 'When you have been with someone for 14 years but masking things and thoughts from her, it was because I was a people-pleaser. 'I've desperately wanted to say what I know will make her happy and do the things that I think she wants me to do - instead of being myself.' Earlier this week Mr Carlisle apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in an attempt to kill himself. The former footballer said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him. Star: Mr Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley against Aston Villa in 2010, at the peak of his footballing career . Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle. Mr Carlisle played for nine different clubs in his 16-year career, including five years at Burnley, and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. Last week, he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a sample when he was stopped by police in December as his car was swerving around the road. He will be sentenced in May.

The 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west London earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who, around Christmas, looked a dead-cert to break the Barclays Premier League record for assists. On Tuesday - his first international appearance since October - he was given just four out of 10 by one Spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the Premier League title following a Capital One Cup win, questions remain about Fabregas' durability. Cesc Fabregas (right) captained Spain on Tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in Holland . The Chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the European champions fell to defeat . After a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard's form has dropped off somewhat of late . 'I'm playing almost every minute of every match (with Chelsea) and that's what makes me happy,' he said this week. But a long, intense campaign on his return to England is taking its toll on the Spaniard. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the Amsterdam ArenA, adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the Blues' title charge decline of late. Fabregas captained the European champions in the Dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against Manchester United's Daley Blind or goalscorer Davy Klaassen. Jose Mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the Premier League run-in . Diego Costa and Fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Hull City . Fabregas was brilliant for Chelsea in their big win away at Swansea City in January but has struggled since . After his £30million transfer to Chelsea last summer, Fabregas' former club Barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-Christmas slump. 'There has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club,' it read. 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. 'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season.' And it seems to have rung true on the stats front. Having picked up 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has just one in five games he has played since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. Thierry Henry's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form, Fabregas is now on track to fall just short. However, with nine games to play Chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against. Fabregas' former team-mate Thierry Henry (right) holds the record for assists in a Premier League season . Henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and Fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump . When he left Barcelona, the  club commented on Fabregas' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump . Their opponents on Saturday, Stoke City, as well as Queens Park Rangers, Manchester United, Arsenal, Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion have all been opened up by Fabregas' passing ability this season, while he scored in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in October. The personal accolade will be important to the midfielder, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks. Mourinho will hope his assist for Diego Costa in Chelsea's last game against Hull City is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong. Fabregas laid on an assist for Costa in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull City, but that was his first in five games . Mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the Premier League title race, with Fabregas a key cog ."}

But he also admitted he was pleased Juve didn't draw the Catalan side in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Pavel Nedved, pictured during his days as a Juventus player, has revealed Barcelona's interest in Paul Pogba . The Czech star, who is a director at Juventus, insisted that French midfielder Pogba will not be moving . Nedved said: We are aware that Barca and other big clubs want him but he has a contract with us.' Barca cannot acquire any players until 2016 after the Catalan club was punished for breaching rules regarding the signing of international players under the age of 18. Pogba has been strongly linked with a move to Paris St Germain this summer while former club United as well as neighbours Manchester City and Premier League leaders Chelsea are also reported to be interested in signing the midfielder. The Frenchman played a major role in helping Juventus clinch their third successive scudetto last season, scoring seven goals and setting up seven more in 36 Serie A appearances for the Bianconeri. Juve, who are still competing on three fronts this season, are currently without Pogba's services after he sustained a hamstring injury last month and was ruled out of action until May. 'We lose a lot without him,' Nedved said. 'He is a footballer with an enormous quality but we cannot cry about it. 'We have a great roster that can overcome his loss.' Nedved expressed his relief that Juventus avoided Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals . Nedved believes that Lionel Messi is currently in the greatest form of his career . Asked for his opinion on Barcelona, Nedved said: 'Barca are now so unpredictable and this makes them even more dangerous. 'With players like Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, if they can run, they will. They were amazing against Manchester City and gave an exhibition. 'Messi is a fantastic player and I don't know what to think when I see him on the pitch. 'He's been at a high level for many years but maybe now he's having his best spell. It's great to see him enjoying playing football. 'I didn't want Barca in the quarter-finals. They are among the two best teams in Europe and favourites to win the Champions League alongside Bayern Munich. 'They are playing to a really high standard, as can be seen by their results over the past few months.

Nedved in action for the Czech Republic during the 2006 World Cup group match with Ghana . Nedved, who made 91 appearances and scored 18 goals for the Czech Republic, added that Real Madrid are 'not at the level of last year,' when they beat Atletico Madrid to win the Champions League. Juventus, who have a massive 14-point lead over Roma in Italy, have drawn French team Monaco in the last eight. Although they are arguably the weakest team left in the competition, Nedved has warned against complacency. 'Obviously there were more famous opponents we could have drawn,' he said. 'But we must not underestimate Monaco. 'They went dangerously close to being knocked out at home, but they impressed me against Arsenal in London.'"}

Sunderland have drawn seven games 0-0 in the Premier League this season – the record in a single PL campaign is nine (Sheffield United in 1993-94 and Leeds in 1996-97). The two players with the most yellow cards in the Premier League this season could meet in this match – Lee Cattermole and Jack Colback (10 yellows each)."}

Rory McIlroy's bid for a third major victory in succession to complete the career grand slam, plus the question of whether Tiger Woods will end his self-imposed exile from the game, have dominated the agenda for weeks. But, although the Golf Club of Houston is set up to try to replicate some of the conditions the players will face at Augusta, Garcia is concentrating on ending his victory drought. Sergio Garcia lines up a putt during the Cadillac Championship in Doral, Florida last month . The 35-year-old, who finished third 12 months ago but went on to miss the cut at Augusta, told a pre-tournament press conference: 'I think that every single week it's a new story and some weeks you play terrible and then the next week you play amazing. 'Some weeks you play great and the next week you play terrible and some weeks I play great and then you play great. You never know what's going to come out. Obviously you hope and you wish that you play as best as you can. 'I think that there's no doubt that obviously the Masters is in the back of our minds, but I'm here to play well, to get in some good rhythm, to have a chance at winning this week and then as soon as Sunday finishes then I'll concentrate on the Masters. Garcia hits his approach from the fairway at the TPC Blue Monster Course last month . 'I'm not going to be on the golf course this week thinking maybe let's try this shot because I'll have it next week on the 12th or on the 15th or something like that. No. I'm going to be focused on what I want to achieve here and then when Sunday finishes then I can concentrate on next week. 'I felt really comfortable here when I came last year. I wanted to try it again this year and hopefully I'll do better next week, too.' Spaniard Garcia plays out of the trees by the 11th hole at Augusta during the Masters in 2013 . Garcia is also comfortable with the fact that he may never win a major after coming close yet again in the Open last year, finishing second behind McIlroy at Hoylake. 'If it comes down to me not winning any majors when I'm done with my golfing career, I'm not going to be sad,' he added. 'It's not the main thing. Obviously it's something nice to have, and if I get it I'm not going to give it back, but it's not the main thing in my life. 'I think as you get older, as you get more and more experience, you realize the important things in life. I'm not saying that winning a major is not important, but it's not the most important thing in the world. I think there's a lot of other things that you can do that can not only fulfil you as a player, but also as a person.' Garcia (left) stands beside Rickie Fowler with their runner-up trophies at last year's Open at Hoylake . Garcia and Texas native Jordan Spieth are the only players in the world's top 10 left in the field after the withdrawals of Henrik Stenson and Jimmy Walker. World number two Stenson has the flu and cancelled a trip to Augusta, while Walker headed to Augusta after winning the Valero Texas Open but was taken ill and joined Stenson in pulling out. The winner in Houston will qualify for the Masters if they are not already exempt."}

It is Dick Advocaat’s side who are struggling at the foot of the Barclays Premier League table – sitting perilously one point above the bottom three - but Sportsmail can reveal that John Carver’s team would be two points ADRIFT of their foes in the relegation zone if it weren’t for Cisse’s goals. The Senegal forward is Newcastle’s top scorer this season with 11 goals, with 10 of those decisive in changing games in the Magpies’ favour. Papiss Cisse is Newcastle's top scorer this season with 11 goals - 10 of those were decisive . 20 September Hull (h) 2-2 (2 goals) 4 October Swansea (a) 2-2 (2 goals) 2 December Burnley (a) 1-1 (1 goal) 6 December Chelsea (h) 2-1 (2 goals) 26 December Man Utd (a) 1-3 (1 goal) 28 December Everton (h) 3-2 (1 goal) 11 February Crystal Palace (a) 1-1 (1 goal) 28 February Aston Villa (h) (1 goal) Since his double against Hull rescued a 2-2 draw in September, Cisse has earned Newcastle 11 points with his goalscoring heroics — almost single-handedly lifting them to mid-table. Take those goals away and the Premier League reads somewhat differently. Newcastle languish in 18th place on 24 points in the fantasy table behind Sunderland on 26. They would have scored just 22 times — the second fewest in the division behind Aston Villa — and won only six games. Six of Cisse’s strikes have been against sides in the bottom half and Burnley, Hull, Everton, and Villa would have leapfrogged a Newcastle side shorn of the striker. After his brace against Steve Bruce’s side, Cisse scored another double to clinch a 2-2 draw against Swansea two weeks later. His next goal was a second-half equaliser in a 1-1 with Burnley in December and, four days later, hit another two to seal a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Later that month he netted in a 3-2 triumph over Everton while in February he scored against his former manager Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace in a 1-1 draw. Cisse also supplied the cutting edge to snatch a 1-0 victory against Villa. The Senegalese striker is currently serving a seven-game ban after clashing with Jonny Evans . 5 April Sunderland (a) 13 April Liverpool (a) 19 April Tottenham (h) 25 April Swansea (h) 2 May Leicester (a) His only goal which hasn’t had affected the outcome of a match was a late consolation penalty in a 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Even when Cisse hasn’t found the net, however, he still has a beneficial impact. Newcastle have a points-to-games ratio of 1.37 when the striker plays but just 0.9 when he doesn’t. In reality, there is little cause for concern as Carver’s side currently sit 10 points clear of the drop zone. But after their trip to the Stadium of Light they will face top-four chasing Liverpool and Tottenham in the coming weeks. Newcastle will be hoping they aren’t looking over their shoulders when Cisse returns for their final three games of the campaign. Cisse nets against Burnley at Turf Moor, a goal that saw Newcastle earn a point in December ."}

The Magpies have lost the last four matches against their North-East rivals and head coach Carver – who was assistant to Alan Pardew during that wretched run – admits that Sunderland wanted victory more than United on those occasions. ‘In the last four games Sunderland have out-worked us - and that's not a good stat to have,’ he said. John Carver says he will 'whip' his players to make sure they're motivated to beat Sunderland on Sunday . Dick Advocaat will take charge of his second game as boss and will want to keep Sunderland's record going . ‘I'll be making sure that doesn't happen again and I'll be using a whip to make sure we don't get out-worked.’ There is a suggestion that Newcastle will struggle for motivation given the comfort of their mid-table position compared to the Black Cats, who are fighting for Premier League survival.

The West Ham manager feels paying Sterling more than the £100,000-per-week deal he was already offered would lead to the 20-year-old's team-mates demanding more. Yet Allardyce does not blame Sterling, currently on £35,000 a week at Liverpool, for trying to get as much as possible. Big Sam feels there are so few talented youngsters emerging that clubs are willing to pay extraordinary wages to sign any available. Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling has stalled over signing a new contract at the Anfield club . Sam Allardyce believes that giving Sterling a bumper deal could risk unsettling the other Liverpool players . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) is extremely keen to keep hold of one of the club's best players . 'When the supply is far less than the demand, then you've got very big demands from the youngster, who is a very talented youngster because there are not enough about,' Allardyce said. 'Not just in the country but in Europe in general, if not in the world. 'The demand is out there. The supply is minimal. A lot less than we want it to be. Hence that gives it a value. When that comes around it's very difficult for a football club not to pay that level of finance that they then demand. 'It reflects down the way from there on in, by the fact that the more the money goes up at the top end the more everybody else wants going down below that.' Allardyce feels if a club were to buy the England international, who currently has two years left on his contract at Liverpool, then they would not only be getting a player, but a brand. 'If a player is in his position like Raheem Sterling, then you're going to look at his value,' Allardyce added. 'Not just his value on the pitch but his value in branding. 'You have to remember that we're hitting 950 million viewers every weekend. The agents and his advisers look at the value of that to the football club, and the value of that to him and their brand, and they ask for that sort of money.' Sterling drags the ball back ahead of the oncoming challenge from Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas (left) Sterling scored his first goal for England during the 4-0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . Big Sam was speaking ahead of West Ham's match with the Barclays Premier League's bottom-club Leicester City on Saturday. The game will see Allardyce reunited with Leicester manager Nigel Pearson after they worked together at Newcastle United in 2007. Pearson has been involved in several controversial incidents this season, including grabbing Crystal Palace's James McArthur by the throat and losing his cool with a reporter during a press conference. It added to speculation Pearson will be sacked but Allardyce defended the man that was once a coach under him at St James' Park. 'Nigel was there (at Newcastle) when I arrived and we worked very well together in that short period of time,' Allardyce said. 'I always thought he was management material and I think he left just after I left, then moved into management and has been very successful. 'I suppose in the end Nigel is a very, very, very, very honest man. He says it how it is. Perhaps that's sometimes the wrong thing to do publicly, but he knows who he is. He knows what he wants. He knows how to try to achieve it.' Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson (left) has been involved in a number of controversial incidents this season ."}

As referees, officials and players made their way off the field and towards the tunnel after full time, a section of the crowd started hurling  plastic water bottles and abuse at them. Sideline interchange official Darren Alchin has been taken to hospital with a suspected broken shoulder after he slipped to avoid being hit with bottles as he fell to the ground.

Canterbury coach Des Hasler has apologised on behalf of his club over the actions of some fans after objects were thrown. 'I just want to offer an apology on behalf of the club,' Hasler said. 'I've been to see the refereeing official who was I think struck by a projectile he's ok but that is not us, that is not what this club is about and it's not what sport in this country is about.

Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league on Tuesday with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Castleford head coach Daryl Powell, the man who made Sinfield captain at the age of 22, trod the same path, although in a coaching capacity after losing the Rhinos top job in 2003, and has a word of warning for his former team-mate. 'It surprised me a little bit,' Powell said. 'It will be interesting to see if he can make a success of it but he's been an outstanding player and captain within the sport and you wouldn't back against him. I think he's been unbelievable in his career. 'He won't need my advice. He knows what he's doing. I'm sure he will have done all his homework. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . 'It's certainly a challenge. You look at Sam Burgess and what he's going through, and Iestyn Harris - it's tough. It's not an easy thing to do. 'The one thing you do have is a bit of a sign on you, on your head. You're a bit of a target. 'It's a completely different sport. It will be interesting to see what position he's going to play, but I wish him all the best.' Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . Sinfield, who has guided the Rhinos to six Super League titles, three World Club Challenges and the Challenge Cup in 2014 at the expense of Powell's Castleford, will be the second high-profile departure from Headingley at the end of the year following Jamie Peacock's appointment as Hull KR's new football manager. The former Golden Boot winner is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, but Powell believes his old club have a ready-made replacement in 20-year-old Liam Sutcliffe, who has deputised for an injured Sinfield in the last two matches. 'They've got some really good young players,' Powell said. 'Liam Sutcllife has slotted in there and seems to be doing a good job. He looks like a mature young player who can handle things pretty much the way Kevin did when he was a young fella. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . 'I was obviously at the back end of my career when Kevin started and it looked like he was going to be an outstanding player. But I don't think anyone could have foreseen how good he was going to be and how many things he would win and how much he would grow as a leader in the game. He's been awesome.' Sinfield has been named in Leeds' 19-man squad for Friday's derby at Castleford, but coach Brian McDermott will not rush his skipper back. 'I'm not sure if he's going to be fit for Friday,' McDermott said. 'What we have got to make sure when Kev does come back into the team is that he's 100 per cent fit. 'Sutcliffe's played really well in these last couple of games. He's held his own and in some parts of the games has played really well. 'It's good to know that while Kevin's in recovery, Sutty is doing a good job and getting more experience.'"}

North has been knocked unconscious three times in recent months, including in last Friday's 52-30 win over Wasps, and was on Wednesday being assessed by a neurologist. 'We won't play him at the weekend,' Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder said. George North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps . 'Clearly he had a nasty knock. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. Thankfully he was well looked after, he came round very quickly and has had no real bad adverse after-effects. But even so, we won't play him this weekend. 'He's making good progress. He's improving and down there at the moment going to see a neurologist and we'll wait to see what the experts say. 'We've got to make sure the medical experts are happy and satisfied that he is fit to return to play and as soon as they say he is, then we'll be happy to pick him again.' North left the field unconscious after scoring the second of two tries in Saints' win, with Wasps forward Nathan Hughes sent off for dangerous play as the Wales wing touched down. Hughes protested his innocence but on Tuesday was banned for three weeks. North also suffered blows to the head on Wales duty in the autumn and during the RBS 6 Nations when twice he had head knocks in the opener against England, controversially continuing before being stood down for the Scotland clash. Former World Rugby medical adviser Dr Barry O'Driscoll says North - the top try-scorer in the competition with seven this season - should not play again this term. Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . Mallinder is not unduly concerned but will await medical opinion. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' Mallinder said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers, I suppose, of playing. 'We're always going to have incidents but player welfare will always come first. We will make sure we follow all protocols.' North might have been eligible for Saturday's match, had he passed the return to play concussion protocols. Mallinder added: 'If it was his first one (concussion) then we would be considering him, if he passed all the protocols that he had to and was available. 'Seeing as it's not his first then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion.' Mallinder was reluctant to comment on Hughes' three-week ban - a punishment which left his Wasps team-mate James Haskell to tweet 'astounded would be an understatement' - but insisted he did not want to see the incident repeated. The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . Mallinder said: 'I said at the time I think it was a red card offence. I still do. The disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. 'You've got to be very, very careful. George North scored a try and therefore there wasn't much anybody could do about that. 'You've got to make as much effort as you can to get away from that incident. We don't want that happening again.' The English champions will, without North, bid to end Clermont's 22-game unbeaten run in European competition at Stade Marcel-Michelin. Two previous meetings have been won by the Frenchmen, who have never lost a home quarter-final in the competition. Mallinder said: 'It is going to be a massive challenge but we have had a few of these challenges over the years. 'I know when we have got a big game because you see in training when the intensity goes up. 'We have got a lot of players used to playing in big games. We are looking forward to it.' North is congratulated after scoring the first of his two tries against Wasps on Friday night ."}

Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career. His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36 . Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 . The Portuguese star now has more goals than 53 teams in Europe's top leagues, including nine in England . There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are: . Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City. Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of. And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille. The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that. Ronaldo's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille . It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards . Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo . Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman . While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years. It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.' If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play."}

Tries from wing Hallam Amos, replacement Nic Cudd, a penalty try plus penalties from Tom Prydie and Dorian Jones and two Prydie conversions brought the Dragons back from a big deficit to victory. Scrum-half Lloyd Williams, fly-half Gareth Anscombe and number eight Josh Navidi crossed for the Blues, while Anscombe added three conversions. Dragons replacement Nic Cudd powers over for try against Cardiff at Rodney Parade . The draw could not have set-up a more mouth-watering Welsh clash than this encounter between the old rivals, with an away trip to either London Irish or Edinburgh the reward for the victors. Cardiff held the upper hand historically, having won the Challenge Cup in 2010 when beating French outfit Toulon 28-21, while the furthest the Dragons had gone in Europe's second tournament was the semi-final stage. The Blues fielded a lot of their big guns, including Wales captain Sam Warburton, while the home region curiously left star British Lions number eight Taulupe Faletau on the bench. The visitors came out of the blocks with a blast, forcing the Dragons onto the defensive over their own line. From the attacking scrum five, the ball found its way to Williams to cross by the post and make Anscombe's conversion easy. Cardiff Blues scrum half Lloyd Williams crashes over for a Blues try in the first half . Prydie reduced the arrears when landing a long-range penalty but the Dragons suffered the loss of international ace Andrew Coombs with a bad leg injury, bringing Faletau into the fray to the loud cheers of the crowd. It was a real cut and thrust affair but the Blues played with far more cohesion and they came up trumps again when, again from a scrum five, the ball went to Anscombe who drove through weak tackling to the line and again converted. The Dragons did themselves no favours with an average kicking game as the Blues found the spaces and pushed them back. The Dragons sqaud are overjoyed after they were awarded a penalty try . But the home side pulled themselves back to within four points of the Blues at half-time when Amos was put away by scrum-half Jonathan Evans under the posts, with Prydie converting. A thorn in the Dragons side was opposition wing Alex Cuthbert, who forced the home defence into multiple tackles - including one from full-back Jason Tovey, whose thumping hit prevented a possible runaway touchdown. The Dragons took it to the Blues after the break as an attacking line-out set up a series of thrusts to the visiting line before Cudd saw a gap and went over just seconds after coming on for flanker James Thomas. Cardiff players Sam Warburton (left),  Matthew Rees (cebtre) and Josh Turnbull walk off the pitch at full-time . Prydie's conversion hit the post but the home side were on top and went in front for the first time when a clearance attempt a few metres from his line by Lloyd Williams was charged down and, as it crossed the line, a try was infringed. Referee JP Doyle had no hesitation in running under the posts for a penalty try, easily converted by Prydie - with Williams earning 10 minutes in the bin. A penalty from Dorian Jones further increased the Dragons' lead - but the vsitors would not give up. From a series of scrums on the home line, Navidi picked up and went by the posts with Anscombe's conversion reducing the deficit to four points. However, the Dragons survived an onslaught in the dying minutes to hold on for the victory."}

George Ford, Dave Attwood, Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson all return to the scene of the 19-9 defeat by Ireland which halted another Grand Slam crusade, and their club’s head coach feels that setback could prove beneficial in their Champions Cup quarter-final. Jonathan Joseph will be among Bath's England contingent in Dublin on Saturday . Bath centre Joseph has a point to prove after England’s Six Nations defeat in Dublin . ‘George, Anthony, JJ and Dave have been telling the rest of the squad what the Aviva is going to be like,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Their experience of that is valuable for us. ‘In the long run, these players come back better experienced and the fact they’ve done what they’ve done with England this season means they are not going to have any fear of going back to the Aviva.’ The leading quartet have points to prove in the Irish capital… . Dave Attwood . The lock produced an energetic performance for England but the line-out he was running crucially malfunctioned twice and he needlessly conceded a penalty. He will be determined to deliver a dominant carrying, aerial and defensive performance. George Ford . As the national team’s playmaker, he was pressured by the intensity of the Irish defence and kicking game — which he didn’t manage to match — in an otherwise superb championship campaign. He will crave the platform to run the show with typical authority. Fly-half George Ford will seek to run the show for Bath in Champions Cup quarter-final . Jonathan Joseph . Bath’s electric centre was a deadly presence in England’s midfield in other games but in Dublin he was not given the ammunition to fire. If he is presented with enough ball then he has the individual talent to shred the home defence. Leinster have been studying him carefully. Anthony Watson . On the wing for England, the outing at the Aviva Stadium was not his finest, as he struggled to handle the barrage from the air. On Saturday, he will be positioned at full back for his club so he must be much more assured under the high ball and use his license to counter-attack from deep to full effect. And here are four of the Ireland players in Leinster colours aiming to sink English hopes again… . Cian Healy . The Lions prop had a limited impact on Ireland’s Six Nations title success as he was eased back into action after injury. However, he starts today for the Blues and will be fired up to demonstrate his clout as a strong carrier who can also more than hold his own in the scrum battle. Leinster's Rob Kearney (right) is a real threat as a strike runner . Jamie Heaslip . The experienced No 8 missed the visit of England after suffering fractured vertebrae in his back caused by the knee of France lock Pascal Pape. These are the days — the big occasions — when he raises his game: strutting, charging and hitting rucks. Rob Kearney . The Ireland full back is imperious under the high ball so the Test encounter with England last month suited him perfectly. He will be keen to provide a reminder of his threat as a strike runner but he also provides a crucial kicking outlet if the hosts are pinned down. Sean O’Brien . He’s known as the ‘Tullow Tank’ and it is easy to understand how he came by that nickname. The Lions flanker is an imposing force of nature at full throttle. He will blast holes in the best defences and commit body and soul to every collision with a madcap, reckless intensity."}

The Ibrox faithful were rocked by Thursday's news that the club had been de-listed from the AIM after chairman-in-waiting Dave King failed to find a new nominated advisor. Interim chairman Paul Murray put the blame for AIM's decision at the door of the club's previous board but tried to play down fears by revealing the new regime in charge is now considering a switch to the ISDX market. Stuart McCall oversees his Rangers players during a training session on Good Friday . There is also the possibility of legal action from former football board chairman Sandy Easdale. But whatever the outcome, McCall does not expect it to derail his charge for the play-offs. The Gers manager said: 'I had a quick chat with [director] John Gilligan and read an email that had gone round the club saying: \"Don't panic, don't worry\". 'I'm a football guy, I don't know what's going on in the stock markets. 'But apparently [the board is] not concerned in any way. The funding and the plans for the club will remain the same. Rangers have been de-listed from the AIM after Dave King (centre) failed to find a new nominated advisor . 'Do I expect it to negatively impact me or the players? No. I hope not and I wouldn't expect it to.' Rangers also this week announced six-month losses of £2.6million for the second half of last year. Among the report's details was the surprise that Rangers will have to hand Newcastle United £500,000 if they win promotion to the Premiership as part of the deal which saw them take five Magpies youngsters on loan in January. It is the type of bill the cash-strapped Light Blues could do without but McCall - who still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the summer - is refusing to worry about it too much right now. Rangers this week announced six-month losses of £2.6million for the second half of last year . 'I was really surprised,' said McCall after being asked for his reaction to loan-deal agreement. 'I was gobsmacked if I'm being honest. 'I was driving in the car when I heard it on the radio and I just thought: \"Woof\". But if that's the deal, that's the deal. 'But I've got enough on just concentrating on what's happening on the training ground and the pitch. 'I've not even given [whether that fee will impinge on me if I'm here next season] a thought. My main concern is the game on Sunday. 'I know you have got to be prepared and be organised but I'm not a three-year or five-year plan guy. I try to do my best here and now and if it's good enough to get us up then great.' McCall admits he was gobsmacked at the news Rangers will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 if promoted . Rangers welcome newly-crowned Scottish Championship winners Hearts to Ibrox on Sunday. It should have been a crucial clash in the race for the title but the Light Blues' mid-season collapse means it only has significance for the hosts as they look to over-take Hibernian in second place. But McCall confirmed his side will pay tribute to the league leaders. 'We will be giving the Hearts lads a guard of honour,' he said. 'It's not something you do week after week but this is their first away game and it's something we will be doing. 'Hearts have won 26 games out of 30 and nine on the bounce. That's incredible. 'Our players might look on a bit enviously and think they'd have liked that to be us who were running out as champions. 'Hopefully they will see it that the season can still be a success, we can still get promoted.'"}

This was a brutal mismatch and a shattering result, not just for the ambitious Saints but for the English game as a whole. Jim Mallinder’s men are imperious in domestic rugby — leading the league by 10 points — but they were simply obliterated by the formidable Top 14 giants. Clermont are nigh-on invincible at home and Northampton could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena. Even in the brief moments when the Saints had the temerity to work up a head of steam and go through the phases, they were pounded back in the tackle and turned over time and time again. Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) scores his second try against Northampton . What unfolded was one-way carnage. France wing Noa Nakaitaci scoring two tries before half-time and Nick Abendanon, the ex-Bath and England full-back, capped a masterful display with a break-away try from 90 metres out. All the while, Brock James kept cranking up the points tally with supreme goal-kicking. Aside from the misery of being dumped out of the Champions Cup in such emphatic fashion, the concern for the Saints will be that this grim rout critically damages their confidence at a key stage of the season. For Northampton and England, there may also be worries over two leading forwards, as Courtney Lawes failed to reappear after half-time and Alex Corbisiero went off, apparently suffering pain in his right knee. Nick Abendanon of Clermont dives over to score a try at the Stade Marcel-Michelin . It was over as a contest long before half-time. There was a pronounced intensity deficit between the sides from the off, with Northampton losing the collisions and appearing somewhat sluggish in contrast to their fired up and energetic opponents. The procession began in the fifth minute when the Saints conceded an early scrum penalty. James landed his first shot at goal and the hosts were on their way. There was so much pressure from Clermont that it was just a matter of time before the Northampton defence was breached. Sure enough, the first try came in the 13th minute, as Fritz Lee blasted clear from a lineout on the right and he released Wesley Fofana. Abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory . The France centre was tackled in the 22 by Lee Dickson, but the attack continued at a furious tempo and, when Nakaitaci carved inside off his left foot, he was half stopped, but managed to climb up off the turf, stretch and touch down. The try was confirmed by the TMO and converted by James. It didn’t help the Saints’ already bleak cause that they missed their first scoring chance. After Courtney Lawes had pinched a Clermont lineout throw, the visitors won a penalty but Stephen Myler was off target with the kick. James landed another penalty, then came the two-try barrage which buried Northampton’s hopes of a famous result. At the heart of the onslaught was Abendanon. First, his break laid the platform for Fofana to burst deep into enemy territory and after Napolioni Nalaga was tackled short of the line, the ball was switched right and James’ lofted pass sent Nakaitaci over for his second try. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . James converted from a wide angle then two minutes before the break, the blitz continued. Jonathan Davies made ground in the centre, Fofana picked out Abendanon and he raced into space, drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home No 12 to charge clear and touch down. Once again, James added the extras and the Saints were sunk. After the break, James struck another penalty before Abendanon made his long-range dash to the line in the 55th minute, for another converted try. Eventually, with Julien Bonnaire in the sin-bin, Alex Waller crashed over to give Northampton something to show for all their desperate toil, but it was far too little, far too late. The horse had bolted. The game was up."}

Now Zara Tindall, 33, has turned her hand to barrel-pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband Mike along while striking a pose for the cameras. The moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer Rob Edmond's marathon barrel-roll from Perthshire to Wiltshire. Taking the strain: Zara straps herself into Mr Edmond's barrel-pulling harness . Pull! Zara pretends to move off while husband Mike beams from his perch on the barrel . Edmond, who set off nine days and 517 miles ago, rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day, only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way. The Bell's Barrel of Laughs trek also saw Edmond, who was the personal trainer on ITV's The Biggest Loser, joined by comedians including Fred MacAulay, Mark Dolan and Rufus Hound. Actress Joanna Lumley launched the challenge at the Blair Athol Distillery last week, while Zara was at the finish line at the Tedworth House Help for Heroes recovery centre. Tindall, meanwhile, joined Edmond for the final leg of the challenge - running with the personal trainer as he approached the finish line. 'It was good,' said the 36-year-old afterwards. 'I would like to say that I did all the hard work but I just got the glory run in with him. All smiles: Zara, who gave Mr Edmond a hug as he arrived (right), certainly appeared to enjoy the experience . Good effort: Mr Edmond, centre, rolled the barrel 517 miles from Perthshire to Wiltshire . Joking around: Zara, who is working towards 2016's Olympic Games, struck a series of poses in the harness . Support: Zara had turned out to watch Mr Edmond and husband Mike cross the finish line . 'I think the most impressive thing about him is that he is just a bit of a joker and he was telling stories about putting deep heat on people's hats to make their eyes water. 'He was talking about keeping his mind entertained and having a laugh. The one thing you see with people who have been around the military is that when they are in adversity or a tough place they always know how to have a laugh and how to make time pass.' Edmond, whose fundraising drive was also supported by Marston's Pubs, added: 'It's been a monumental challenge but we've made it and the support has been fantastic. 'We can't thank the British public enough.' Tindall, who recently appeared in the Bear Grylls endurance show Mission Survive, praised the work of Help for Heroes, which is set to benefit from Edmond's feat. 'Tedworth House is a pretty impressive place and looks the bees knees, and it is great to see how the money helps,' he said. He also revealed that he hopes to take on some charity challenges of his own. 'I am always quite keen to do any sort of charity challenges now that I am retired,' he said. 'I am doing a quadrathlon later this year, which I am a little bit worried about. I have always enjoyed this type of challenge, so you never know.' Achievement: Mr Edmond, who managed to cover 60 miles a day, completed the feat in just nine days . Heavy: Mr Edmond ran the entire way and rolled the whisky barrel for up to 12 hours a day . Helping out: Mike Tindall ran the final few miles alongside Mr Edmond . Beneficiary: The money raised by Mr Edmond will be donated to Help for Heroes ."}

Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott . Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'"}

Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during the team's FA Cup quarter final replay with Bradford City last month. The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time, before being tackled by stewards. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during their quarter final replay with Bradford City last month (pictured) The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience' - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all Reading's future home and away matches. Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he has no regrets about the incident, saying that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' Charlie Sumner, pictured outside Reading Magistrates' Court. He is facing a potential banning order . After running onto the pitch, Sumner was tackled by stewards. The footage of Sumner's antics went viral . The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he talked with his friends in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' 'I don't want a three year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At today's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order."}

Recent legislation has given women more rights in golf clubs, while St Andrews and Royal St George's have both voted to admit female members for the first time. But Alliss told the Radio Times magazine that equality for women had 'b******* up the game for a lot of people'. Veteran broadcaster Peter Alliss (second right) claimed gender equality laws have ‘b*****ed up the game’ The commentator also claimed the BBC should have done more to secure the Open coverage . 'There's been a hell of a row because four golf courses that hold the Open Championship didn't have women members,' he said. 'I'm told the Ladies Golf Union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in. Hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they've gone from paying half fare to full fare. It's caused mayhem. 'All of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the facilities for free. When I was at Muirfield a couple of years ago talking to a few of the lady members, I said, \"What about this equality? You must be happy about that?\" \"God no,\" they said. \"We can come here and do what we like, we can play golf and don't pay anything\".' He added: 'The equality thing is a great part of golf. Equality for women: a few people battled away to get it, they got it, and they have b******* up the game for a lot of people.' Alliss' comments come as the 2016 Open Championship will be the last to be broadcast live on the BBC before Sky Sports takes over. The former professional golfer, 84, told the magazine: 'I very much regret that the BBC has lost the Open Championship, but I said it might do 10 years ago.' He admitted that the BBC could not compete with Sky's deep pockets but added: 'I don't think there were enough people at the BBC dealing with the negotiations who cared enough. 'I can think of a couple of heads of sport from years ago who would have battled harder. But, having said that, when people get used to it I think the highlights will be wonderfully supported.' Alliss defended his style from critics, saying: 'I think they just don't like my delivery. They either think I waffle on, or don't know enough about the young players coming up. '\"You're living in the past! You're one of the old Colonel Blimp school: must wear a tie to go and have a pee in the clubhouse.\" That sort of thing. 'I think I've moved very well with the times. But there are certain standards in golf that have been there forever.' The Broadcaster insisted he could not work for Sky . He said that he could not imagine working for Sky. 'They never asked me. I was a BBC man through-and-through and they paid me well enough,' he said. 'I think Sky is magnificent and if you like golf it's amazing, but they do it differently. The presenters look different. If I went to Sky the best I could do is sit in the studio or have a pre-tournament ramble about the players.' Alliss added: 'I was watching golf from Dubai a couple of weeks ago. It is a masterpiece, one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World. Every skyscraper is different. And in the middle of the desert they have created a golfing oasis. 'Not once in over four hours did the commentator say, 'What an amazing place this is'. You hoped the camera would pan round, lift up from the course. I would have said something daft like, 'If you've got very good eyesight, you might just see Lawrence of Arabia over that hill'.' He said that he had 'thought about leaving' the BBC. 'I've got problems getting about but the brain is still sharp enough,' he added. 'When I don't think it's sharp enough, I shall say I'm off. The BBC keep saying to me, 'Stay as long as you like.' 'It's lovely nonsense. What if I live to be 105? They'll only keep me as long as I'm all right, and I'll only stay as long as I'm all right,' he said."}

After McIlroy was on the cover of Men's Health magazine and admitted he was 'obsessed with the gym', Faldo, a three-time Masters winner, voiced his concern that the 25-year-old was spending too much time on the weights. Faldo last week told the Daily Telegraph: 'Throwing 200lb and 300lb weights around is not going to be good for your golf swing. The heaviest weight I would ever lift was my body weight. You can play some pretty good golf when you have just got some decent shoulders on you and a strong neck and a strong pair of hands.' Sir Nick Faldo puts a hand on Rory McIlroy's shoulder during Monday's practice round ahead of the Masters . McIlroy and three-time Masters champion Faldo greeted each other with a handshake at Augusta National . McIlroy's fitness programme doesn't seem to be doing him too much harm. He goes into the year's first major as the bookies' favourite and looking to become just the sixth player in history to complete the career grand slam. He shook Faldo's hand on Monday and the Englishman, wearing a green jacket McIlroy would love to have in his collection, gave him a squeeze on the shoulder. As expected, McIlroy drew a huge crowd as patrons piled in to the famous Georgia course and Scottish amateur Bradley Neil had a taste of things to come as he practised with him. The patrons were also keen to get close to McIlroy as Masters week began with the Monday practice . McIlroy, preparing to tee off on the fourth, is bidding to win a fifth major and complete a career grand slam . World No 1 McIlroy made sure he put in a bit of work in the huge bunkers at the Georgia venue . Meanwhile, just 27 per cent of McIlroy's fellow professionals think he will complete the career grand slam by winning the Masters this week. But the good news for the 25-year-old is that he is far more popular than defending champion Bubba Watson, who cannot rely on too much support if he gets into a fight at Augusta National. Those were among the results gleaned by an ESPN.com survey of 103 tour professionals - 21 of whom were major champions - who anonymously answered questions on a wide range of topics. Asked if McIlroy would be wearing a green jacket on Sunday, 28 players said yes, 72 said no and three abstained. McIlroy will have caddie JP Fitzgerald on the bag to help him plot his way round the stunning course . The Northern Irishman had Scottish amateur Bradley Neil for company during Monday's practice . And McIlroy congratulated Neil after he chipped in at the second... save them for Thursday Bradley . Asked which player they would not help in a fight in the car park, Watson got double the number of responses (22.6 per cent) of second-place finisher Patrick Reed (11 per cent). Rory Sabbatini was third and Robert Allenby fourth. Other topics covered in the survey included slow play and recreational drugs - Kevin Na was judged in need of the first one-shot penalty in 20 years on the PGA Tour, narrowly ahead of Ben Crane, while 40 players felt the Tour should stop testing for marijuana. And on the subject of Tiger Woods, only seven per cent thought he would not win another major before the start of the season. However, after Woods missed the cut in Phoenix and withdrew from his next event after 11 holes, the numbers became 50/50.

The Chiefs outscored their opponents six tries to one at Sandy Park, with a David Ewers score and a penalty try helping the home side into a 17-6 half-time lead. Exeter then added further tries through Thomas Waldrom, Byron McGuigan, Sam Hill and Dean Mumm after the break, with outclassed Newcastle only able to respond with a 68th-minute effort from Chris Harris and eight points from the boot of Tom Catterick. Carl Rimmer of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Newcastle Falcons' Dom Barrow during match at Sandy Park . Exeter's Thomas Waldrom stretches over for a try during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match . The victory means Exeter will take on Gloucester at Kingsholm in two weeks' time for a place in the final against either Newport Gwent Dragons or the winner of Sunday's London Irish-Edinburgh encounter. The hosts made a number of changes from the side that lost 25-18 at Leicester in the Premiership last weekend with McGuigan, Ben Moon, Tomas Francis and Tom James being drafted in. The Chiefs were also forced into a late change with Damian Welch pulling-up in the warm-up so Ben White was promoted from the bench to play in the back row, skipper Mumm moved into the second row and Sam Skinner added to the replacements. Newcastle, who lost 46-17 to Exeter in the Premiership last month, started with two changes in the backs from the side that narrowly lost at London Irish with Juan Pablo Socino in the centre and Harris on the right wing. Both defences were tested in the opening 10 minutes but it was Exeter who made the first breakthrough just before the quarter-hour. Dave Ewers of Exeter Chiefs (centre) makes a break during his side's 48-13 victory against the Falcons . After the Falcons were forced to touch down over their own line, Exeter broke off the back of the five-metre scrum and Ewers barged over the line. Slade added the extras from out wide on the right and the Chiefs were under way. Exeter increased their advantage midway through the half when wing Matt Jess, who was on course to score from a loose ball, was pulled back twice off the ball by full-back Alex Tait. Referee Marius Mitrea had no hesitation in awarding a penalty try - which Slade converted - and Tait went to the sin-bin. Newcastle kept the Chiefs at bay while they were a man down and when they were back to full strength the visitors were awarded a penalty 12 metres out in front of the posts, which fly-half Catterick slotted over to get his side off the mark. Slade and Catterick then swapped penalties to leave Exeter with an 11-point lead at the interval. Dan Temm of Newcastle Falcons tackles Thomas Waldrom during the quarter-final encounter . That soon became 18 points as just 45 seconds after the restart Ewers broke from inside his own half, shrugged off a couple of half tackles, before offloading to number eight Waldrom to stretch for the line. Slade converted and, 12 minutes later, added his second penalty from 30 metres out to make it 27-6. The Chiefs' fourth try came just before the hour-mark when Will Chudley chipped over the head of the defence and into the arms of McGuigan to go over, with Slade again adding the conversion. The Falcons may have looked down and out but Harris rounded a couple of forwards to score a breakaway try under the posts with Catterick converting to cut the deficit to 34-13. However, the Chiefs replied immediately through Hill to help restore their advantage and then Hill turned provider for Mumm to score the Chiefs' sixth and final try, with replacement fly-half Gareth Steenson converting both to cap a one-sided triumph."}

A fortnight after the shock departure of chief executive Edward Griffiths and three months since the revelation that the north London club are being investigated by Premier Rugby for alleged salary cap breaches, The Mail on Sunday can reveal Saracens’ mounting debt has topped £40m — the most in rugby history. The rising costs facing the club are also a concern, with the wage bill leaping more than 50 per cent in three years. Saracens now owe £41.6m, according to new filings at Companies House, much of it funded by an unsecured loan from long-standing benefactor Wray and a consortium of South African business associates. Saracens chairman Nigel Wray has dismissed rugby’s salary caps rules as ‘a farce’ The employee wage bill ballooned to £9.1m last year and, with Wray admitting further losses lie ahead, there are growing concerns about the club’s financial health. A move by Saracens last December to scrap the salary cap — which is currently £5m but was £4.5m in the period covered by the new figures — drew no public support from other Premiership clubs. With discussions ongoing over the viability of ring-fencing the top flight, or at least restricting promotion and relegation, Wray has restated that the salary cap must be scrapped. ‘We need to change the farce whereby we are all operating under different rules,’ wrote Wray in a chairman’s statement in the club’s annual accounts seen by The Mail on Sunday. ‘We have one wage cap, the Irish provinces have no wage cap, the French clubs a wage cap twice ours, all of which makes no sense whatsoever. It needs to be changed. ‘In financial terms, it was another difficult year [2013-14]. Having been involved in professional rugby now for 20 years, I’m constantly amazed how hard it is to break into people’s culture. Documents show his club’s wage bill soared by another £1million last season alone despite investigation . ‘The big cities have that soccer culture but built over 100 years. Allianz Park [the purchase of] is a vast step forward and gives us a permanent home but we still have much to do. We could, of course, cut costs very considerably — for example a top French club has a medical staff of three, far smaller than ours. But we really don’t see how you can aspire to be one of the best club sides in Europe if you don’t have a fantastic support system for the players.’ The club have lost on average just over £5m per year over the past four years, more than doubling its debt burden in that period. Annual accounts for 2013-14 show the club’s parent company carry no legal obligation to service the debt, meaning they could technically walk away at any time and leave the club insolvent. Of most interest to their Premiership rivals will be the dramatic hike in salaries paid to employees, which rose from just over £8.1m to more than £9.1m last year . The Mail on Sunday can reveal Saracens’ mounting debt has topped £40m — the most in rugby history . The club took on 24 new staff in that time, nine of them players and coaches, but with the salary cap set at just £4.5m last season — not allowing for one ‘marquee player’ who theoretically could earn an unlimited salary but in reality will not get more than £500,000 — questions persist over the club’s salary structure. Even allowing for the unlikely scenario of a £1m budget for coaching staff, that would leave more than £3m in staff costs for 54 administrative staff — an average salary of more than £55,000. A Premier Rugby spokesman said: ‘Saracens have recently moved into a new purpose-built stadium, Allianz Park — which is a huge asset to the local community — with a number of new staff added. ‘The club are in an investment phase and, given the strength of the shareholding base, this is something they can manage.’"}

Trott dramatically left the 2013/14 Ashes trip after just one match at the Gabba having struggled with what was initially labelled a 'stress-related condition' and later diagnosed as situational anxiety. Cook was concerned that would be the end of his Three Lions days but has watched the 33-year-old rebuild his career with typical focus and determination, first with Warwickshire then during a productive winter tour with England Lions. Jonathan Trott during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play . The pair are now heavy favourites to open the batting together in West Indies this month and should get a first chance against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI on Monday. Uncapped Yorkshireman Adam Lyth is the other top-order batsman on tour but Trott appears to have first claim after batting alongside the skipper in Saturday's centre-wicket practice session at Warner Park. 'He was in a bad place in Brisbane and at the time I would have been surprised that he'd come back, but it's a huge credit to the work he's done off the field and the effort he's put in,' said Cook. 'That obviously shows his desire to come back to play for England. Test captain Alastair Cook feels the batsman is ready for the 'pressure cooker' of international cricket . 'He has almost demanded selection with the runs he has scored for Warwickshire and it's great for me to see him back in an England shirt. He's a great guy and if he gets his chance he'll be desperate to do well.' Cook accepted there was no guarantee over how Trott would react to the glare of the international game, which remains several notches beyond anything he will have experienced on the county or Lions circuit. But with a CV boasting 49 Tests, 3,763 runs and nine centuries, Cook is delighted to have him back on board and nudging the selectors for a recall. 'I am (confident), but you don't know 100 per cent until he's put out in the environment - that is always unknown,' he said. Trott (left) and Cook train together during a batting session at Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevis . 'There's a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you're put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and, make no mistake, it's a high-intensity environment, there's no doubt about that. 'But Trotty's done everything we've asked of him. He feels confident in himself and he's just looking forward to taking that next step. 'What we do know is he's a quality player. You don't have his stats and that weight of runs behind you without being a quality player.' For his own part, Cook is in need of a successful series both as captain and run-scorer. The last of his 25 Test centuries came in May 2013 and he was stripped of the one-day captaincy on the eve of the World Cup, though in hindsight his absence from the tournament may have been a blessing given England's travails. The Warwickshire batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call-up . Now, rested and recharged following his enforced spell at home, he is setting his sights on nothing short of victory in the three-Test series. 'It's been great to spend a bit of time at home, live a bit more of a normal life away from the travelling circuit of cricket,' he said. 'That's been great, at home with my family, but now it's the serious business of trying to win the series here. 'It's always important we win. When you play for England you carry the hopes and the pride of the nation on your shoulders. 'That hasn't changed since the day I started playing.'

Warwickshire batsman Trott touched down in the West Indies with England on Thursday night, back in the international set-up for the first time since leaving last winter's Ashes tour with a stress-related illness. Trott has spoken openly of his struggles since, but has slowly rehabilitated his career with both Warwickshire and the England Lions and is now on the brink of returning to Tests. Jonathan Trott returns to the England set-up for the first time since taking a break with a stress-related illness . The 33-year-old has worked extensively with Dr Peters during the last year, learning from a man who has done notable work with the British cycling team, Liverpool FC and Ronnie O'Sullivan, and who introduced the 'Chimp Paradox' in a bid to help people better manage their own minds. But speaking in The Independent, Peters said there is no magic cure and that Trott had worked hard to counter his problems, which he described as 'situational anxiety'. He wrote: 'He ticked all the boxes. It was a foregone conclusion to me that he would make massive progress - I just hoped that he would then perform as he has been doing and justify his place. Now he has done that. Dr Steve Peters worked with the batsman and gave him the necessary tools to return to the game . 'He's an incredible cricketer. The advice I give to most of the people I work with is not to go public because obviously you're training people to do a skill. A lot of people don't understand it is a skill and therefore you might not get it right. 'People are expecting a magic-wand cure and that's not really the way it works. Jonathan decided he wanted to go public about this because he has done so well. 'It's a credit to the man. You can have periods in sport, sometimes a whole season, when things just aren't happening and you're just digging even harder to make it happen again - that's effectively what Jonathan has done. Trott has impressed since returning for Warwickshire and the England Lions, earning his return to the squad . 'From a psychological point of view, Jonathan is quite robust and certainly determined. It was just a case of giving him the tools to understand what was going on.' Peters, who helped mentor the golden generation of British cyclists and also worked with O'Sullivan for his last two world titles, can see no reason why Trott will not make a successful return to Test cricket. 'What Jonathan did was to take it very seriously, he meant business, which is a measure of the man,' he added. Peters (left) has worked with Liverpool, Ronnie O'Sullivan and the England football team in recent years . 'He was very open, hard-working, and what I effectively told him to do was to get some insights into the way his mind was working. Then it was up to him to operate [his mind] in the way he wanted it to, rather than it dictating to him what was going happen. 'I don't have a recipe for people. It's up to the player himself to manage the mind in the way they want to in the future. That's something anyone can do, it's not something you only do when you're distressed. Jonathan had what became a situational anxiety, and once that was understood, he was able to manage it. 'My feeling is that he'll do very well and he won't have any problems now because he has that insight.' Trott reacts while bowling during a friendly match at Edgbaston, Birmingham during his comeback ."}

Goals from striker Kenny Miller and the returning midfielder Haris Vuckic had the home side two ahead and cruising before McCulloch was shown a straight red card by referee Bobby Madden for fouling striker Osman Sow. It left the 10-man Govan side to fight a rearguard battle in the second half and, although Jambos striker Genero Zeefuik reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute, Rangers held on to move into second place in the league, three points ahead of Hibernian with a game in hand over the Leith club. Lee McCulloch was sent off during Rangers' crucial 2-1 victory against Hearts in the Scottish Championship . Staurt McCall says the Gers captain apologised to him as well as the players after the incident . The Gers boss said: 'Believe it or not I haven't seen it again and I didn't see it live - all I was interested in was Zeefuik going through the middle - but I spoke to Bobby coming off and he said he caught him with his elbow. 'Jig (McCulloch) came in after the game and apologised to me and the team so obviously it must have merited a red card.' The former Rangers midfielder paid tribute to Gers supporters in the crowd of 40,521 who willed their team on to a third successive win when they were down to 10 men. He said: 'In the second half, that was the first time for a long, long time, since I was playing, that I got goosebumps out there. McCulloch walks off the pitch after he was shown the red card on Easter Sunday . 'The fans deserved that (win) but I thought the players deserved their applause coming off the park because you need both together to be a success. 'It was pleasing in a lot of ways. We set out with a game plan to stop Hearts playing because they are a good side, no doubt about that. 'Obviously it was two terrific goals, but I thought the tempo and passing in the first half was outstanding. 'I thought the second half was just about guts, desire, being a good team-mate, so it was a hard shift but a nervy finish.' Man of the match Nicky Law also noted the improving relationship between players and supporters. The Rangers midfielder said: 'The crowd just lifted everyone and the atmosphere was as good as it has been since I signed at the club and Hearts fans played their part in that as well. 'Probably for the first time the fans have been right behind us and united as one, which it hasn't been for a while and that was great to see. 'We know that has been down to ourselves in large parts because it hasn't been good enough. 'But we hope that they see the effort we are putting in and hopefully we can achieve the aim that we started the season with and repay the fans. 'It was a huge win for us. Three wins on the spin now and the boys are buzzing.' McCall has paid tribute to the 40,521 Rangers fans who made it to Ibrox for the game . It was Hearts' first away defeat in the league all season and head coach Robbie Neilson refused to be too downbeat. He said: 'I thought we dominated in the second half without creating a lot of chances. I don't think we did enough to win. 'But the pleasing think is I am sitting here at Ibrox, having lost 2-1 and everyone is devastated. 'We have to take a step back and look at the big picture. 'We are 23 points clear at the top of the Championship and we are guaranteed top level football next year. 'So I don't want to be too down. I spoke to the players after the game and told them to put it into perspective. 'When they walk out of Ibrox they should have their heads held high because they are champions and it doesn't matter what happens in one game, it is a 36-game league and they have been the best team.'

The break can be both a blessing and a curse, potentially halting your momentum if results and confidence are positive, or halting your slide if all is not well. Premier League sides have already had to resume their season after international breaks in September, October and November 2014. Premier League leaders Chelsea have won all three of their matches following the international break . Everton lead the post-international Premier League table with three wins from three after the break . However six Premier League clubs are still chasing their first win after an international break this season, so who has been the best at managing this transition? Sportsmail examines this through a modified Premier League table that takes in only results immediately after international resumptions. Our alternative table makes nice reading for Toffees fans, with their side winning all three matches and keeping clean sheets against Aston Villa and West Brom. Champions-elect Chelsea are the only side to match this perfect record, though both of these teams have not faced a current top seven team across their post-international fixtures. Southampton and both Manchester clubs are the only other unbeaten sides though United did slip up in drawing 2-2 at home to West Brom. Manchester City have been relatively impressive, drawing 2-2 at the Emirates and most notably dispatching Champions League chasing Tottenham 4-1, who have an indifferent record. Moving further down and Liverpool have a significantly worse record following the international break than in overall form, suffering surprise defeats when visiting Crystal Palace and hosting Aston Villa. Moreover their only win came through an unconvincing 3-2 victory at Queens Park Rangers, secured only through a sensational second-half display by Raheem Sterling. Manchester United will be hoping to follow up their win against Liverpool by beating Aston Villa . Arsenal are awaiting their first Premier League win directly following an international break . Brendan Rodgers (right) will be hoping his side can pile more post-international misery on Arsenal . Saturday . Arsenal vs Liverpool . Everton vs Southampton . Leicester vs West Ham . Manchester United vs Aston Villa . Swansea vs Hull . West Brom vs QPR . Chelsea vs Stoke . Sunday . Burnley vs Tottenham . Sunderland vs Newcastle . Monday . Crystal Palace vs Manchester City . Both the Reds and Arsenal will want to change the vast discrepancies between their current league table positions and their positions in our alternative view, currently sitting in eighth and 13th respectively. The two Champions League sides meet on Saturday lunchtime as Arsenal chase a first win following an international break this season. The Gunners have been fortunate in having three home fixtures but have totally failed to capitalise on this, drawing 2-2 with Hull City and Manchester City, whilst losing 2-1 at the hands of Manchester United. Southampton have handed out two thrashings to sides in the North-East by picking up 8-0 and 4-0 wins over Sunderland and Newcastle respectively. However in this table the Toon still make the top six through narrow 1-0 wins over both QPR and Leicester. The Foxes have a notably improved position whilst keeping clean sheets against Sunderland and Stoke in their three post-international games, despite these being relatively rare across the season. Relegations strugglers QPR have lost all three of their post-international fixtures so far this season . This puts Nigel Pearson’s side comfortably nestled in mid-table, joined their relegation strugglers Burnley. Possibly benefitting from having fewer players occupied on international duty, both join a cluster of teams on four points. Stoke will also be concerned by their poor record, which includes 2-1 and 1-0 defeats when hosting relegation-threatened sides Burnley and Leicester City. Such results across an entire campaign may have seen them struggling to maintain mid-table stability under Mark Hughes. Hull City, Sunderland and West Brom are all winless, though the Black Cats did claim a respectable 2-2 draw at home to Tottenham. Swansea City and QPR are both pointless, though the Swans have had three games including difficult trips to Chelsea and Manchester City. Meanwhile the R’s have hosted Liverpool whilst suffering away defeats with scoring at both Newcastle and Manchester United – Chris Ramsey’s team will hope to change that trend when travelling to West Brom on Saturday."}

When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game. This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs. Francois Louw runs with the ball during the Bath Rugby training session held at Farleigh House . Bath's George Ford practices his kicking during the training session at the Farleigh House complex . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Sailosi Tagicakibau during the Champions Cup match with Wasps . In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga (right) charges with the ball during the match against Bordeaux-Begles . Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale. Wasps captain James Haskell receives a pass during the training session at Twyford Avenue Sports Ground ."}

The 21-year-old, who could have gone second in the world rankings with victory in Houston, just missed taxing birdie shots on 16 and 17 to take it all down to his final hole. And just after his tee shot narrowly avoided the bunker, Wagner dramatically birdied the par-four 18th with a 25ft putt to card a 69 and create a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard. Spieth still had the chance to win it outright but found a bunker, and he needed a fine 42ft chip and then a 12ft putt to rescue par and join the play-off. Once it began, things quickly went south for the Texan. He found the greenside bunker with his second shot, and then made a poor shot out from a difficult lie, claiming something had distracted him during his backswing. He would be eliminated with a bogey. Wagner had also run into trouble with his second shot but salvaged a par, and when Holmes missed from 10ft they headed back to the tee to try again. Spieth was the first to drop out in the play-offs, after bogeying the first hole to fall out of contention . Johnson Wagner celebrates his birdie at the eighteenth, to earn a place in the play-off, but he fell just short . Neither man had dramas on the way to the green this time but Holmes got much closer to the hole with his second approach shot, and after Wagner over-hit a long putt Holmes again had the chance to win it from 10ft. His putt drifted a couple of inches wide but Wagner's putt from four feet lipped out and Holmes could celebrate. 'I knew I had to play a really low round to have a chance, but I started out great and it worked out for me,' Holmes said on Sky Sports 4 before turning his attention to next week's Masters. 'It's great any time you get a week where you can win going into a major. I went there Monday and Tuesday and saw the course so hopefully I'm ready. I'm hitting it well, and looking forward to it.'"}

Surrey-born Kelvin Day has only played a handful of events on the subsidiary circuit, the Web.com Tour but decided to enter qualifying for the Houston event. This is a real 36 hole lottery where 131 players were fighting for the final four spots. With two excellent rounds of 64, the 27-year-old finished tied first to earn his place – and how he has taken advantage. It was a decent achievement in itself to make the halfway cut, and it earned him a third round draw alongside two rather more famous Englishmen in Paul Casey and Justin Rose. Kelvin Day is three shots behind the leaders and remains in with a chance of making the Masters . Day, however, refused to be overawed as he put together a tidy, bogey-free scorecard to match the 68 shot by Casey and upstage Rose, who shot 72. Incredibly, that has left Day alongside Casey in tied sixth place, just three shots off the lead held, almost inevitably, by the remarkably consistent young American, Jordan Spieth. Realistically, a top ten finish would be a fine achievement for Day, which would earn him a place in the field for the tournament after the Masters, the Heritage in South Carolina. But it is worth bearing in mind that a victory would not only earn him a PGA Tour card but the last spot in the field for Augusta. Wouldn’t that be some story? Casey only learned he was in the field for the Masters himself last Sunday, and is continuing his welcome revival this season with another good showing. He is a former winner of this event and again showed his liking for the course. Record crowds descended on the Houston suburb of Humble to watch the great crowd pleaser Phil Mickelson, who began one off the halfway lead and the newest Texan golfing hero, Spieth. Jordan Spieth leads the way in Houston . But while the latter delivered with a 67 to lead the way on 14 under, Mickelson could only muster a 75 to tumble down the leaderboard. It’s amazing to think it’s only 18 months since Spieth was attracting heavy criticism for dropping out of college to take his place on the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. While his former university classmates are studying hard for their final exams, 21 year old Spieth might be said to have passed his own particular exam with flying colours, since he has risen to fourth in the world and will go second behind Rory McIlroy should he claim this title on Sunday. He would also take his earnings over those 18 months to almost $12 million. Funnily enough, he’s not attracting criticism anymore. Spieth, watched by his parents and younger sister Ellie, hass a one stroke advantage over a trio of lesser-known countrymen – Scott Piercy, former Houston champion Jason Wagner and Austin Cook. ‘I’ve got a lot of friends as well as my family in the gallery and I shall certainly be trying to win for them on Sunday,’ said Spieth. If he did that it would be his fourth victory in his last nine starts and underline his status as one of the favourites to win the green jacket. Spieth finished runner-up behind Bubba Watson on his Masters debut last year. Like Day, 24 year old Cook is trying to write an astonishing story of his own. He just happens to be the Monday qualifier who tied Day for first place. As for Mickelson, his poor form over the past few months caught up with him on Saturday after opening rounds of 66 and 67 had raised hopes he was close to his best. The 44 year old fell apart over the closing stretch, registering four bogeys in his last five holes."}

The 26-year-old England full-back is interesting his former club, where his brother Joel plays, and Wigan have an option to bring him back to the DW Stadium. When announcing his departure barely 18 months ago, Wigan announced they could re-sign Tomkins on a 'defined salary' on his return to Super League. Sam Tomkins has been released by the New Zealand Warriors after feeling homesick . And while Tomkins says it would 'be nice' to resume his Wigan career, he is tentatively exploring alternative options too. Asked where he would be playing next, Tomkins said: 'I've not worked that out just yet. The first thing was to sort it out over here that I could go back. 'Hopefully that'll be sorted in the not-too-distant future.' Wigan is where Tomkins launched his career, playing for the club from 2008 to 2013, so it is inevitable he should be linked with last season's Grand Final runners-up. 'That's where my brother's playing and that's where I'm from, but I'm open to other places. I'm just trying to work out what will be the best option for me,' he said. 'Wigan would be nice but I know it's not the only team I can go to.' Before the announcement on Wednesday morning that Tomkins will be on the move, Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan told Wigan Today: 'If he became available we would be very interested. 'We've got the first option. If it gets to the point where he is available it is in our hands. And I'll be delighted if that was the case.' Tomkins has been open with his current club about the reasons for wanting to leave. Rather than not settling into the New Zealand game, it is being apart from his family and friends that has been niggling away at Tomkins, unsettling him and leaving him longing for life back in the north of England. He told Sky Sports News: 'I've enjoyed every minute of being amongst that group but New Zealand is pretty far from Wigan, where all my family live, so I want to be back in England around my family. Tomkins celebrates winning the Super League Grand Final with Wigan in 2013 having spent five years with club . 'I'll be two years I've been away and to be able to go back and be around family and friends is what I'd rather be doing next year.' A replacement for Tomkins has already been found by New Zealand Warriors, with Kiwi international Roger Tuivasa-Sheck agreeing a three-year contract that will take effect from next season. Tuivasa-Sheck will join from Sydney Roosters, with New Zealand Warriors head coach Andrew McFadden describing the 21-year-old on Wednesday as 'a wonderful talent and a fantastic signing'. That has cleared the way for Tomkins, currently sidelined with a minor knee injury, to depart without causing excessive disruption 12 months before the end of his three-year contract. Tomkins joined the Warriors for a world record transfer fee - thought to be in the region of £700,000. 'They invested a lot into me to get me over here which I appreciate,' he said. 'They handled that brilliantly when I was coming and again equally so when I've asked if I can leave. 'It was tough because I feel like I owe them something and hope I can pay them back with another big year this year.' New Zealand Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said of Tomkins: 'He came here excited about testing himself in the NRL and also experiencing living in a new country but, in the end, Sam has found it too much of a challenge being away from home. 'It's disappointing that it has come to this but reluctantly we have accepted there is no option but to allow Sam to return to England.'

Barred from bringing their cell phones on to the Georgia course, fans have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital cameras or their old 35mm bodies and lenses and re-learning how to use them. But a quick refresher course is all they're allowed. When play begins on Thursday, fans will have to put them back on the shelves. A Masters patron uses her camera to take photos of the action during the player practice rounds ahead of the 2015 Masters at Augusta National Golf Course in Augusta, Georgia, which starts on Thursday . 'Actually, the last time I had this out was Easter,' Wayne Watson said about the large black Nikon hanging around his neck. And the time before that? 'No idea,' he said. 'Probably the Easter before.' More than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were, like Watson — who made the two-hour drive from Macon — experiencing Augusta National in person for the first time. Most just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy. Some had general targets in mind — a favorite player or two, the trio of back-nine holes reverentially dubbed 'Amen Corner,' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway. Then there was the occasional experienced big-game hunter, decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses. 'I'm after Phil Mickelson,' said Kim McNeeley of nearby Aiken, South Carolina. 'I got a great shot of him the last time I was here — 18 years ago. 'But there are plenty of guys more serious than I am,' she added. The cell phone ban at the Augusta National Golf Club has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes like Tiger Woods . 'I had to borrow this from a friend who just had a baby. A few minutes ago, I saw a guy actually loading film into his camera. Film. Now that's old school.' Stepping back in time produced more than a few comical moments. Parked in lawn chairs behind the first tee, two pals leaned in close as one tried to figure out how to take a 'selfie' with a point-and-shoot camera — never mind that the term hadn't even been coined when the camera was originally manufactured. Behind the seventh tee, Kevin Davis of Gibson City, Illinois, recounted the preparations he went through to make sure his 4-year-old digital camera was ready to roll. First, he had to find it — 'It took me awhile to remember where I left it,' he said, finally remembering it was in a desk drawer — and then make sure it was charged. 'I've got a big camera, but I didn't want to lug that around,' Davis added. 'That's usually for family events.' Fans photograph Tiger Woods on their cell phones during a practice round for the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club South Course in Akron, Ohio, last July . But he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5-year-olds saw the camera and realized it wasn't a phone. 'They were scratching their heads,' he recalled. 'They said, 'Daddy, why is it so big?'' The fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists. While many planned to share their photos with friends on social media, a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album — talk about old-school — and in the case of Wes Rackley, make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents. Few people, though, seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as Brett Pavel of Atlanta. He was at Augusta National for the 20th time — 'I think that's right,' he said, 'because I've got at least 18 shirts — and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week. 'My wife calls it my \"pacifier,\"' he laughed, 'because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else.'"}

Tim Sherwood’s team were set to drop into the bottom three when Charlie Austin scored his 17th Premier League goal of the season 12 minutes from the end, before Benteke’s intervention five minutes later to cap off a pulsating game. The point lifts QPR above Burnley to 18th on goal difference, while Villa move above Hull to 16th. Tim Sherwood was disappointed that Aston Villa's domination of QPR did not result in three points for his side . Sherwood did concede that the point taken could be vital and praised Christian Benteke for his hat-trick . Sherwood said: ‘I’m disappointed with a point when we’ve dominated the match like that. The referee should have stopped it at half-time. Anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn’t have been close. ‘But it’s not about what you deserve, it’s about what you actually get. This could be a vital point come the end of the season. When you’re going so late into the game and Christian’s had to pull that one out of the bag, we’re grateful for that.’ Chris Ramsey was equally frustrated that his team only took a point from Villa Park, having twice led, initially through Matt Phillips’ header. Benteke equalised with a deflected shot before putting Villa ahead before the break with a cool finish. Defender Clint Hill levelled the game with a header before Austin struck and Benteke scored his seventh goal in five Villa games to ensure honours finished even. Benteke was Villa's star man, twice pulling them level with three goals that earned a point at Villa Park . Charlie Austin had scored late on for QPR as they looked to claim and unlikely away end in the Midlands . Ramsey praised Benteke, saying: ‘He is a formidable player. When you are playing against people that can pull out that little bit of magic, sometimes you have to hold your hands up. His free-kick was a fantastic strike in off the post against a top keeper, who had it been anywhere else probably would have saved it.’ The QPR head coach added: ‘Based on the way we played in the second half and the beginning of the first half you have to be disappointed you haven’t been able to get above the line, which was the aim before we started the last two games. We showed tonight we’re more than capable of doing that. I don’t know what we need but we’re probably going to have to win three games. We know our next home games will be very important. We have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last game of the season. QPR head coach Chris Ramsey called Benteke a 'formidable player' after he took apart the visitors . Sherwood and Ramsey embrace before kick-off having spent periods of their careers working together . ‘Any team would take being in it right till the end and then roll the dice. You don’t want to become detached where every game is a mountain to climb. There is a belief in the camp they are capable of surviving, there is no doom and gloom.’ Sherwood added: ‘We’re creating chances, aren’t we? I can’t really understand why they scored 12 goals before I came in, incredible really for players with that kind of strike-rate... we must keep our tempo up and shore it up at the back. Otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble.’ Sherwood now takes his team to Tottenham and Manchester City. ‘Who is to say we can’t go to any of those games and win?’ he said. ‘We’ll try. We can’t do what QPR have done today, we’ll play on the front foot.’ ."}

In a double hit for thousands of holidaymakers trying to leave Britain today, strikes by French air traffic controllers and new border control checks threaten severe delays. Air passengers face up to three days of disruption, with British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Flybe among the airlines forced to cancel dozens of flights. Scroll down for video . Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Chaos: New passport regulations could cause queues on roads leading to Dover and Folkestone (file photo) And those travelling abroad by ferry or Eurotunnel face queues as exit checks are introduced at Britain’s ports. The change, which takes effect from today, means every passenger in a car or coach will have their passport scanned. The walkout by France’s biggest air traffic controllers’ union SNCTA will begin at 5am today and run until 5am on Friday – with vast knock-on disruption expected. Last night, easyJet, which flies to more than a dozen French cities, said it was cancelling 118 flights, including ten directly affecting the UK. BA warned of ‘significant disruption’ and apologised for the cancellation of around a dozen return flights from Britain. Flybe said it was cancelling 16 of today’s flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Crush: Passengers travelling on the Channel Tunnel or on cross-Channel ferries are likely to see the worst of the disruption (file photo) Ryanair said it was cancelling 250 of today’s flights, with more likely, branding the strike ‘grossly unfair’. Nearly a third involve the UK, although many are destinations outside of France hit by the knock-on effect. A Ryanair spokesman said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options – full refund, free transfer on to the next available flight or free transfer on to an alternatively routed flight. The Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation because industrial action is classed as an ‘unforeseen circumstance’ outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. In response to dire warnings that the introduction of border control checks would cause chaos, ministers have tried to lessen the impact by phasing the new rules in. For the first month, all passports will be scanned but only a quarter of passport holders will have to have their details verified. By June, this will rise to 100 per cent . Forget Rome or Athens, the best place to bask in spring sunshine this week will be Britain. The glorious weather is set to stretch out for the rest of the week – with hotter temperatures here than in many Mediterranean destinations. The mercury is set to rise steadily until Friday, when southern parts of England are forecast to hit 21C (70F) or higher, which would be the hottest temperature here so far this year. Rome and Athens are only expected to reach 16C (61F), while Marseille is set to stall at 18C (65F). But make the most of it when you can as last week’s cooler weather is predicted to return on Sunday. Dan Williams, spokesman for the Met Office, said: ‘We are looking at high temperatures until the weekend. It will be cooler and breezier over the weekend with some rain. That will make way for more unsettled weather into next week.’"}

Well, there is only one person to blame — and that is Colin Graves. The incoming ECB chairman has been responsible for the mixed messages that leave the England team in as big a state of turmoil and internal rebellion as ever. Graves has forged an excellent reputation in English cricket as chairman of Yorkshire for the way he bankrolled and transformed the club, but his initial forays into the international game have been little short of an embarrassment. Colin Graves has made a habit of talking before thinking since being announced as ECB chairman . He has become the loose cannon of English cricket — and he has yet to take up office. It all started on March 1 when he gave an interview to Garry Richardson of the BBC, who is known for his persistence and admirable success in coaxing ear-catching sound bites from interviewees. So when Graves said that Pietersen — exiled for valid reasons after the last Ashes debacle before producing a nasty autobiography that only supported the ECB's decision — had to be playing county cricket to earn an England recall, it was put down to Yorkshire straight-talking. Yet subsequently, most importantly in a phone conversation with Pietersen, Graves has done little to play down the 34-year-old's chances — even if privately the chairman is said to be perplexed at the media's 'spin' on his apparent opening of the England door. If Graves, who has apparently assured senior figures that he does not want Pietersen back, really had no intention of encouraging the maverick, then he has made a right old mess of it. For he has created a soap opera that will run and run now Pietersen has rejoined Surrey and put huge pressure on a fledgling England middle order who made significant Test progress last summer. England head coach Peter Moores (left) and Alastair Cook  answer questions at a press conference . Not to mention completely undermining managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker, who have repeatedly clarified England's stance on the batsman over the last 14 months. And if Graves disagreed with the original decision to axe Pietersen, then he had a duty as deputy chairman of the ECB to say so then, not wait until he had taken over from Giles Clarke. That is not all. Since his Pietersen outburst, Graves has said that there will be an inquiry if England do not beat a 'mediocre' West Indies in the upcoming three-Test series. This prompted the respected Barbadian commentator Tony Cozier to liken the comments to Tony Greig's infamous intention in 1976 to make the West Indies 'grovel'. Then Graves came out with the ridiculous notion of reducing Test matches to four days. This would be achieved by introducing the unrealistic target of playing 105 overs a day — a move that would destroy the primacy of the ultimate game. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has been linked with a return to the national side recently . If Graves wants to make himself useful, then he should concentrate on his supposed main aim of introducing a 10-team English Premier League franchise Twenty20 competition. Everybody bar a few myopic counties wants that. He could also do something about a crippling fixture list that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months — a key factor in why they have fallen so far behind in the 50-over game and just endured the worst World Cup in their history. There is much for the ECB's new regime — which includes new chief executive Tom Harrison and communications director Chris Haynes — to do, but all the new chairman has done so far is make things worse. Colin Graves should think very carefully in future before he speaks."}

Bosch, striking the ball into a strong wind, landed a 55-metre penalty in the final act of the last eight showdown against Racing Metro to snatch a 12-11 victory at the Stade Yves-Du-Manoir. It completed a scarcely believable win given Saracens had been battered for most of the match only to display remarkable tenacity and set up a semi-final appointment with Clermont in St Etienne in two weeks. Marcelo Bosch kicks the winning penalty as Saracens beat Racing Metro 12-11 . Bosch is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the kick that won his team the game . Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall admitted he was surprised to see Bosch taking the penalty . 'With kicks like this you're either the hero of the day or the bad guy, so I'm happy that it went my way. I just stayed relaxed and fortunately it went through the posts,' Bosch, 31, said. 'Sometimes they ask me if I'm keen to take the long-range kicks and because of the wind it was not a good distance for the other kickers. I said 'why not? I can take it' and the rest is history. 'The last time I did a kick like that was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina. It was from more or less the same range against our classico rivals. 'It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. I tried to be as relaxed as possible because we had the wind in our face and I didn't want to force it. 'It was the last minute of the game so I was tired and tried not to think about what it represented.' Bosch also executed a try-saving tackle on Racing wing Juan Imhoff when all his Argentina team-mate had to do was fall over the line for a potentially decisive final-quarter try. 'Juan is a real player. He's like a striker - always smelling the goal. I followed him and fortunately stopped him from scoring at the end,' Bosch said. Until Bosch delivered the knockout blow - referee Nigel Owens awarded the penalty with 10 seconds left on the clock - a full blooded quarter-final that was often a poor spectacle appeared to be destined for a home win. Saracens fly-half Charlie Hodgson kicked one penalty and full-back Alex Goode supplied six points to keep the match favourites in sight. Two second-half penalties from scrum-half Maxime Machenaud, who also crossed for the game's solitary try in the 27th minute, placed Racing in control that the Parisians only relinquished as Owens was preparing to blow for full time. 'I was surprised to see it was Bosch taking it because I though it was in Alex Goode's range,' Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said. 'But the wind was very strong, so it was Bosch's range. He had the nerve and balls to say he wanted it, which is half the battle. He hit it pretty sweetly. 'Marcelo is pretty cool. He's pretty laid back, but like anybody, that's one of those kicks that if you miss it can cause the damage. 'I'm very grateful that he held his nerve. He also made the tackle on our goalline that kept us in the match as well. Chris Ashton (left) of Saracens is tackled by Juan Imhoff of Racing Metro in the quarter-final clash . Alex Goode (centre) of Saracens sprints with the ball as Jamie Roberts (right) approaches . 'We weren't great in the first half even though we had a very strong wind behind us. But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. 'We went hunting and kept knocking them down and scrapped for absolutely everything.' Racing's Wales centre Jamie Roberts was distraught at the outcome. 'I'm hugely frustrated and gutted for the team. We thought we had it in the bag. That last minute cost us so fair play to Marcelo with the kick at the end,' Roberts said."}

City's goalscorers that day were defender Keith Curle, now manager of League 2 strugglers Carlisle, from the penalty spot,  former Brentford boss Uwe Rosler and Paul Walsh. City went on to finish the Premier League season in 17th, two places above the drop zone. Blackburn: Flowers, Kenna, Berg, Pearce, Hendry, Le Saux, Sherwood, Atkins (Batty, 78), Ripley, Sutton, Shearer. Scorers: Shearer, 7, Hendry, 39. Booked: Sutton, Atkins. Manchester City: Coton, Edghill, Foster, Curle, Kernaghan, Summerbee, Flitcroft, Simpson, Rosler, Walsh (Beagrie, 78), Quinn. Scorers: Curle (pen), 32, Rosler, 57, Walsh 71. Booked: Kernaghan, Simpson. Paul Walsh scores  in April 1995 - the last time Man City won having trailed at half-time in the Premier League .

Alan Shearer celebrates for the eventual Premier League winners after scoring the opener on seven minutes . While City have not won having trailed at the interval in almost two decades, all of City's top six rivals have managed to overturn half-time deficits in the last five years. Spurs came from behind to beat Hull in November 2014, Manchester United and Chelsea claimed victory after trailing at half-time last season. Liverpool beat Aston Villa after losing 1-0 at the interval against Aston Villa in March 2013 while Arsenal came from 2-1 down to beat Chelsea 5-3 in October 2011. To make matters worse, it seems Manuel Pellegrini's men are in need of some new blood. City had the second oldest starting XI in the Premier League this weekend with an average age of 29 years and 345 days; only West Brom fielded an older side, during their 4-1 home defeat to QPR. Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and goalkeeper Joe Hart were the only starters against Palace aged 28 or under. Arsenal – 29/10/11 – 2-1 down at Chelsea at HT, won 5-3 . Chelsea – 11/5/14 – 1-0 down at Cardiff at HT, won 2-1 . Liverpool – 31/3/13 – 1-0 down at Aston Villa at HT, won 2-1 . Manchester United – 5/10/13 – 1-0 down at Sunderland at HT, won 2-1 . Tottenham  – 23/11/14 – 1-0 down at Hull at HT, won 2-1 . Here are more shocking stats which shame Man City... Swansea have earned two more Premier League points than Manchester City since selling Wilfried Bony ."}

She hit a 6-iron to 18 inches to set up a birdie on the 158-yard, par-3 eighth and closed with a par on the par-5 ninth. The top-ranked New Zealander started the streak in the first round of her victory in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship last year. Her worldwide streak is 32, counting the three rounds she played in her victory in the Ladies European Tour's New Zealand Women's Open this year.

Reading took the lead with only four minutes gone when Pavel Pogrebnyak got a touch to Garath McCleary's nod-down to divert the ball past Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall. But they allowed a mediocre Cardiff side to snatch a point in the 90th minute when Conor McAleny rifled in a shot from Aron Gunnarsson's precise pass. Cardiff's Conor McAleny (left) celebrates after scoring a late equaliser against Reading .

On their previous semi-final appearance, in 1927, they lost 3-0 to eventual winners Cardiff at Molineux. As Reading's cup displays have been impressive, though, their league form has been patchy. They had won only two of their previous nine Championship matches, losing six of them. Cardiff's season has been one of inconsistency, too, but they arrived at the Madejski Stadium on an unbeaten run of three matches. They were also undefeated on their travels for five games, winning their past three. Reading made the early running and were rewarded in only the fourth minute when they went ahead. Jordan Obita crossed from the left, McCleary nodded it forward and Pogrebnyak guided it past Marshall for his third goal in two matches. Cardiff, beaten 2-1 at home by Reading in the cup fourth round in January, replied quickly. McAleny tried a snapshot from the edge of the Reading area but his effort was half-blocked and goalkeeper Adam Federici gathered comfortably. Reading could have stretched their lead when captain Alex Pearce rose to meet a McCleary corner but fellow centre-back Michael Hector got there before him and glanced his header wide. Cardiff tried hard to get back into the game but had little joy. Fabio cut in from the left flank but his powerful strike was blocked by Pearce at the near post, and Peter Whittingham's dangerous free-kick was neatly caught by Federici. Pavel Pogrebnyak celebrates scoring for Reading against Cardiff . Reading continued to assert control after the break, with Chelsea loanee Nathan Ake impressing on his debut in midfield. Most of Reading's best creative moves were channelled through him. Cardiff relied on the swift counter-attack, with Joe Ralls almost setting free McAleny. But his final pass carried too much pace and, with McAleny unable to retrieve it, the chance went begging. An opportunity also went astray at the other end, when Bruno Ecuele-Manga's poor pass was intercepted by McCleary but the Reading winger hesitated too long before firing a shot wide of Marshall's far post. Cardiff responded with a low shot from Craig Noone, which Federici did well to save, and a header from Ecuele-Manga from another Whittingham free-kick, which drifted wide. Reading went much closer in the closing stages. Substitute Kwesi Appiah, on debut on loan from Crystal Palace, forced a fine stop from Marshall and Hector nodded a McCleary corner into the ground and up against the crossbar. But Cardiff grabbed a draw right at the end from McAleny's fine finish from the edge of the home area."}

Townsend celebrates his strike with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Ryan Mason (left) and Kyle Walker . In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break ."}

The England full-back remains unsure when he will return after pulling out of Harlequins' Aviva Premiership clash with Saracens at Wembley last weekend. Northampton wing George North has been advised by leading medics not to play again this season after suffering four quick-fire concussions, while Ireland's Johnny Sexton was stood down for 12 weeks earlier this term. England full back Mike Brown admits he is unsure when he will return to action for club side Harlequins . Brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time. 'It was just after the France game, there wasn't one incident where I was dizzy or concussed, but after the game I just didn't feel quite right,' said Brown. 'I had a headache the Sunday and Monday, so just being cautious with it, I don't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something. 'You don't want to be into a situation where you're out for a long time like Johnny Sexton or Geoff Parling or something like that. 'So with what's coming up at the end of the year, everyone's being cautious, and I'm being cautious as well. George North will not play against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and will see a neurosurgeon . North suffered his fourth quick-fire concussion after being knocked out against Wasps on Friday night .

Try telling that to Alexis Sanchez. Marino was the manager who brought Sanchez into Udinese’s first team in 2008 after he had been signed from Chilean club side Cobreloa two years earlier. Udinese had Italy internationals Antonio di Natale, Simone Pepe and Fabio Quagliarella vying for places up front, but Marino knew in Sanchez he had a ‘jewel’ on his hands. Alexis Sanchez has impressed for Arsenal this season following his £30million switch from Barcelona . Pasquale Marino, pictured managing Pescara in 2013, brought Sanchez into the Udinese first team  in 2008 . The main problem he encountered, however, was that he could not keep Sanchez off the pitch. ‘Alexis could easily play three matches per day,’ Marino, now in charge of Vicenza, said. ‘As soon as the (training) match started, Alexis used to abandon the scarico and would run up to me, almost imploring: “Mister, let me play, just for a few minutes. Please, please, please. I promise I won’t get injured.” Football is an enormous pleasure for him.’ That hunger earned him two £30million moves, first to Barcelona in 2011 and then to Arsenal last summer. It is also why Sanchez, Arsenal’s stand-out player this season, found it so difficult when he was rested for two games by Arsene Wenger — against Aston Villa and Tottenham — with a sore hamstring. Sanchez spent five years with Serie A side Udinese before earning a move to Spanish giants Barcelona . Sanchez takes on  defender Miranda during Chile's friendly with Brazil at the Emirates Stadium last week . ‘Putting him on the bench is like taking a toy from a child,’ Marino warned. ‘There was just one thing that worried me when he joined Barcelona — they were full of amazing forwards and it was by no means a given that Alexis would be in the starting 11. ‘Since I know how important it is for him to play, I feared that without regular football he could become discouraged. But he proved he was good enough to become an essential part of the team and fitted into the Barca way of playing.’ Big money moves have not sapped any of Sanchez’s energy. Speak to Arsenal players and they describe the same enthusiasm in training, the same refusal to embrace rest days, the same disregard for ‘scarico.’ Sanchez found it difficult when he had to be rested for Arsenal's matches with Aston Villa and Tottenham . They warned him that when the games rained down over the winter it would soon catch up with him, but Sanchez, bar that short Wenger-enforced break, has not stopped, even if he hasn’t been as prolific as he was in the first half of the season. That is why Marino believes Sanchez, still only 26, could elevate himself alongside the planet’s greatest. ‘He’s never looked as strong as he does now,’ Marino said. ‘Personally, I think he could score more than 35 goals a season in any league he plays in. ‘If he succeeded in doing that, he would be at the same level as two monsters of the modern game: Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Nowadays only those two, and maybe Zlatan Ibrahimovic, can claim to be better than Alexis.’ Marino believes Sanchez is looking strong and capable of scoring 35 goals  in any league he's played in ."}

Taking part on Channel Four's 'Alan Carr's Chatty Man' alongside Denise van Outen, Noel Fielding and Lethal Bizzle, the on-loan Manchester City star spoke of his support and feels that football in evolving for the better. When host Carr said: 'Do you think we will ever see a gay footballer? Statistically there should be loads. One in ten are gay aren't they? Fifty-thousand professional footballers, one of them must be.' Frank Lampard showed his support for gay footballers in an interview on Alan Carr's Chatty Man . LA Galaxy Robbie Rogers (left) came out as being gay and was heavily supported by the sporting world . Former West Ham United midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger also came out as being gay not long after Rogers . Lampard responded: 'Well we have had a couple. Thomas Hitzlsperger who played in the Premier League, came out after having moved back to Germany or Italy. 'In America, Robbie Rogers played there. 'I think a lot of the problem is, as you say, it's a fact that it will be out there, as it is in all modern life at all times, but I think we are probably at fault as a sport. 'I think that it's that old syndrome where it's a mans game and you can't talk about that. I have to say the game's changing a lot. There are a lot of campaigns. I feel it in the dressing room. There's a different feel about it. 'Yeah there should be. I would love it if someone came out and everyone treated it with respect. You know that thing about 'we're macho we play football,' is very old hat.' With Lampard's career nearing the end, the New York City man is already thinking about what his next step will be - refusing to rule out the chance of becoming a manager. He said: 'I'll maybe do my coaching badges which is a bit of a process as that's two years worth of work to get that and maybe be a manager but I'm not completely sure whether to go down that route or down certain other routes- bit of TV maybe. The City midfielder was joined on the show by Noel Fielding (left, Lethal Bizzle and Denis van Outen . 'Everyone's lining up to do that at the moment you know the punditry thing is the thing to do. Everyone that retires wants to go in, and it's not an easy thing. It looks quite easy to talk about football but it's not.' Following England's disappointing 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Carr pressed Lampard on why we perform so bad - despite the quality in the country. Lampard, who made one appearance during the finals, believes that a lack of squad cohesion may have been the catalyst causing England to finish bottom of group D. 'I think we didn’t gel as much as we should have done,' he said. 'When you look at the individuals in those pictures (on screen) you know you're talking about some of the best individuals in world football at different times. We've had them and we haven't done it.' Van Outen and Noel Fielding also took part on the show where Lampard scored a penalty against Carr .

Professional golfer Lexi Thompson, 20, will appear on the front of May's edition of Golf Digest . She appeared in the Women's U.S. Open when she was just 12. At the time she was the youngest player ever to have appeared in the major tournament . She celebrated the shoot by tweeting: 'I landed on the May cover of @GolfDigest ! So pumped to represent fitness & power.' The decision has sparked a mixed response from readers. PGA teaching pro Chance Scheffing told CBS New York: 'I wasn’t sure if it was a Playboy ad, or if it was a Golf Digest ad.' Golfer Morella Carta added: 'I just think that this is a detriment to women, because I’d like to be recognized by being a good golfer; not about how my body looks like in the front page of a magazine. 'I think that if we allow this to happen, we will never get to the place where we should be.' It is the first time a pro-golfer has appeared on a 'Fitness and Power' issue cover - with past choices embroiling the publication in controversy. Thompson (pictured in 2014) turned professional in June 2010 at age 15 and in September 2011, she set a new record as the youngest-ever winner of an LPGA tournament - 16 years, seven months, and eight days . Fox Sports golf reporter Holly Sonders, who was with the Golf Channel at the time, appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in 2013. The next year, the magazine featured Paulina Gretzky, who was only connected to the sport as PGA tour professional Dustin Johnson's fiancee. LPGA Tour Commissioner Mike Whan said he was 'disappointed' in Golf Digest's position to put Gretzky on the cover. Lorena Ochoa was the last female golfer to appear on the cover back in 2008. Editor-in-chief Jerry Tarde said in a publisher's note: 'We've come a long way from a year ago when the LPGA condemned our choice of Paulina Gretzky (and Holly Sonders in 2013) as the cover images for Golf Digest's annual fitness issue. Mea culpa, ladies. 'You can have stunning beauty and the highest level of golf performance at the same time, as demonstrated this year by Lexi, Stacy Lewis, Cheyenne Woods and Michelle Wie.' Thompson celebrated the shoot by tweeting: 'I landed on the May cover of @GolfDigest ! So pumped to represent fitness & power' He added: 'LPGA players not only outdrive the average guy by 20-plus yards, but they do it with the same clubhead speed we have. We can learn more from them not because they swing like us, but because we should swing like them. 'They don't just muscle the ball and make up for swing flaws with strength.' The publication also confirmed that the shoot took place in a closed set and Thompson's mother was in attendance so she could discard any shots. Thompson made the news last year after jumping into Poppie's Pond, a tradition for tournament winners at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California. She has just completed a faultless win in the Kraft Nabisco Championship. She turned professional in June 2010 at age 15 and in September 2011, she set a new record as the youngest-ever winner of an LPGA tournament - 16 years, seven months, and eight days - when she won the Navistar LPGA Classic. Thompson was the youngest player to play in the Women's U.S. Open in 2007 when she was just 12. However her record was beaten last year when 11-year-old Lucy Li qualified. In 2014 the magazine featured Paulina Gretzky, who was only connected to the sport as PGA tour professional Dustin Johnson's fiancee ."}

The Gunners take on Brendan Rodgers' side at the Emirates, third in the Premier League and six points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool in the race for the top four. And in training ahead of the showdown, Arsene Wenger's side managed to appear relatively relaxed ahead of such a vital contest. Arsenal players target defender Laurent Koscielny (centre) with a friendly slap during training on Friday at London Colney . Wenger must be in high spirits having seen his side win all six matches they played in March as the Frenchman picked up the Manager of the Month award. Free-scoring Olivier Giroud, who fired in six goals over the month, completed the double to pick up the player accolade. Arsenal welcomed back Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Debuchy and Abou Diaby to first-team training this week in a boost to their squad.

But Wenger said: 'Yes, I'm worried about Theo's confidence. He's sensitive and I'm a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. 'He's not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. 'At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready.

So, who are Cape Verde and why has this tiny island off the west coast of Africa suddenly become an international football force? Where are the Cape Verde Islands? Cape Verde is a group of islands 400 miles from Senegal off the west coast of Africa. Its population is around 500,000 and boasts both beautiful beaches and striking volcanic landscapes, making it a haven for tourism . Cape Verde is a picturesque island off the African coast with a population of just 500,000 people . Does it have any footballing tradition? More than you think. Manchester United winger Nani is from Cape Verde and could have played for them instead of Portugal. Celtic and Sweden legend Henrik Larsson's mum is from Cape Verde. Being a former Portuguese colony, most people support the big Lisbon clubs Benfica and Sporting, you see the club's scarves and banners hanging from cafes and bars . Sporting Lisbon ace Nani (centre) is from Cape Verde but decided to represent Portugal at national team level . Former Barcelona star Henrik Larsson could have played for Cape Verde as his mother was born on the island . Why the sudden success? Like a lot of African countries including Algeria and Ghana, Cape Verde decided to start recruiting players who grew up in Europe, mostly Portugal in their case, but were eligible for them through family ties. Around a quarter of the Cape Verde squad are European, although 14 of the 19 players used in Portugal were born on the island. They qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and reached the quarter-finals, and qualified again this year. They are the smallest nation ever to play in the continental finals. Cape Verde were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 . Who are the star players? Every member of the squad plays club football outside Cape Verde, mostly in Europe and particularly Portugal. Striker Heldon plays for Sporting Lisbon and midfield set-piece specialist Babanco is with Estoril. Odair Fortes, who scored their second goal against the Portuguese, plays in French football for Reims. Other members of the squad ply their trade from Romania, Angola, Cyprus, Hungary, Holland, Bulgaria and Mexico . Sporting Lisbon striker Heldon, currently on loan at Cordoba, is one of Cape Verde's key players . What can Cape Verde offer visitors? Firstly, sunshine. The temperatures rarely dip below 21 degrees Celsius (70 F) even in the December and January winger months. The name of the main beach Boa Vista (beautiful view) says it all. It is beginning to become a big tourist destination, just a six-hour flight from the UK. Visitors are encouraged to sample the excellent local fish and admire the spectacular dunes and volcanic mountains. Boa Vista beach, pictured, is one of the main attractions on the small island of Cape Verde . Are they a flash-in-the-pan? The FIFA rankings would suggest not. Cape Verde currently stand 38th in the world, one place ahead of Scotland. Although they failed to make the knockout stages of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, they did return home unbeaten after three draws against Tunisia, Congo and former winners Zambia. Cape Verde celebrate during their 2-0 friendly victory over Portugal on Tuesday evening . What is the special relationship with Portugal? Portuguese explorers discovered the island in 1456 and it stayed a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975. But famine and lack of economic opportunity around the same time meant many young Cape Verde men were forced to go to Portugal to build new lives there. Now the country's football team is helping them re-establish their roots. The reason for Tuesday night's friendly in the first place was to raise money for the victims of a volcanic eruption on the Cape Verdean island of Fogo. And the only saving grace for Portugal... Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't playing. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was rested for Portgual's clash against Cape Verde ."}

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United . The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game . Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets . The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets . 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were . Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon . West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday . Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The \"bad old days\" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of \"fans\" have thankfully been left far behind us now. This is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit. Let’s hope that this message hits home loud and clear to Leeds United Football Club.'"}

United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City . Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season . United have lost the last four derbies to City: . 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City . 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United . 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City . 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United . United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games . Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014 . 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning . Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'"}

The moment was captured on video and shows Alaska Department of Fish and Game Biologist Tom Seaton leading 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile. The land mammals were freed from a temporary pen, where they had been kept for just over a week during the transition, and followed Mr Seaton to their new home. They journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the Innoko River before reaching the grass meadows of Lower Innoko, which is surrounded by the Yukon River. Wood bison are North America’s largest land mammal, but the native Alaskan species disappeared from the state more than 100 years ago. In the video the animals can be seen chasing after the snowmobile in a herd from within side a fenced track. Wood bison were imported from Canada to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in 2008 but restoration of the threatened species was delayed. The population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the United States for first time in over a century .

Landowners didn't want their property listed as critical habitat with additional federal oversight. The state and federal governments agreed to consider the Alaska wood bison as 'experimental' without the usual Endangered Species Act requirements. With the help of corporate and non-profit sponsors, the department moved 50 cows and 50 juveniles aged two or less to the village. But the task was not without its risks as the large mammals were vulnerable to broken limbs, or if they fell, trampling. Two wood bison bulls photographed grazing at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in Portage, Alaska . Wood bison cows resting and grazing at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center  in Portage, Alaska . Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Cathie Harms, said: ‘When you're transporting a very large, not completely domesticated animal, you always have to worry about injuries.’ To minimize jostling in the cargo plane the juveniles were transported in small groups within special bison boxes. Cows had individual pens, which provided them with enough room to stand for the one-hour drive from the conservation centre to Anchorage and a one-hour flight to the village. Once arrived, the bison moved on their own from the boxes to the snow-covered fields in a fenced area outside Shageluk. The land mammals chased after the snowmobile, which dropped alfalfa cubes, in a herd from within side a fenced track . The wood bison journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the Innoko River before reaching the grass meadows of Lower Innoko . Ms Harms said: ‘Some of them trotted out, some of them galloped out. Some of them made it all the way to the opposite end of the pen, as far away from people as they could get. ‘Some of them stopped 15 feet from the box and started eating hay.’ Over the next seven to 14 days the bison were moved on a daily basis from one pen to another to keep them from settling into one place. Before the snowmobile coaxed them with alfalfa cubes and led them to their new permanent location, which should start producing an abundance of sedge – one of the bison’s natural foods – once the snow melts. Like we never left! The bison arrive at their new home, which will have sedge for them to feed on once the snow melts ."}

Events at Lord's, where the decision was made to cull England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton, seemed rather more relevant to the future of English cricket than the mix-and-match day at Warner Park, where four members of the touring party were parachuted in to bolster the local team. Jonathan Trott (nought) and Gary Ballance (17) largely failed to do so, but Bairstow made 98 and Joe Root ended the day 87 not out in a score of 303 for nine. England paceman Stuart Broad (left) bowls at Jonny Bairstow on Wednesday . It seemed entirely in keeping with the unsatisfactory nature of England's Test preparation week that Bairstow, the only member of the seconded quarter not likely to feature in the series, had the most productive day. At least Broad averted serious injury when he collapsed clutching his left ankle in the second over. Broad initially looked in trouble when his boot slid through the crease and he tumbled to the ground, and coach Peter Moores was concerned enough to stride out to the middle to assess the damage. But he spent just short of an hour off the field with an ice pack and later returned to the attack. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall . Broad was concerned enough about the run-ups to summon the groundstaff the ball before coming to grief. He initially suggested bowling round the wicket in search of firmer footing but decided to go back to his original angle of attack after sawdust was applied. When he went down the game was just 10 balls old - the same number of deliveries that were possible in the infamous abandoned Test in Antigua six years ago. By that stage, the first of England's honorary Kittitians had already come and gone. England captain Alastair Cook (right) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease . Trott opened the batting but lasted just three balls, guiding James Anderson straight to James Tredwell at third slip. That was hardly the added steel England were looking for. The same was largely true of Ballance, who seems short of his best after a troubled World Cup, and managed only 17 before an ill-judged cut against Tredwell ended up in Jos Buttler's gloves. Ben Stokes had earlier ripped out Shane Jeffers' middle stump and Tredwell had Sherwin Peters lbw offering no stroke. Bairstow, whose likely Test role is as Buttler's back-up, reached lunch on 33 not out in a score of 55 for four. Bairstow fell just short of a century against England on Wednesday . He continued to score briskly in the afternoon and was just two short of a ton when Stokes found his outside edge to have him caught behind. The game lacked all semblance of competitive edge, even as Root compiled a trouble-free half-century of his own, but there were some possible pointers ahead the first Test in Antigua. James Tredwell clearly outbowled Adil Rashid in the race for the spinner's role and Chris Jordan failed to take a wicket despite seeing plenty of the ball. He came into this game in pole position but could fall behind Liam Plunkett or Mark Wood, who will open the bowling for St Kitts & Nevis on Thursday morning. Jonathan Trott opened the batting St Kitts & Nevis but lasted just three balls . Bairstow gave little away about dressing room reaction to Downton's departure, partly because he was ready to go out and bat as the news was delivered in the lunch interval. 'We just found out at lunch,. No-one said anything, it was straight back out and get on with our job out here in St Kitts,' he said. 'I don't know what the role entails or anything like that, it's a decision that's taken above us...I don't know what the job description is. 'It's our job out here to get on with the task at hand and win a series for England.'"}

This time, Dai Young has sounded the annual alarm. Wasps’ director of rugby could not have asked much more from his gallant side as they pushed Toulon all the way before losing their Champions Cup quarter-final at Stade Felix Mayol on Sunday. Yet, the scale of what they were up against was illustrated by the sight of Matt Giteau and Juan Fernandez Lobbe – two of the world’s finest players – coming on as replacements for the hosts. A pair of Springboks, Bryan Habana and Juan Smith, were among a glittering non-playing contingent. Wasps coach Dai Young has called for reform to the Premiership salary cap so English clubs can compete on the European stage - the comments came after his team lost 32-18 to Toulon on Sunday . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Toulon's English speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Young quipped that the absence of Leigh Halfpenny from the Toulon ranks meant that Wasps only had ‘about five world-class full-backs to worry about’. The joke hinted at a more serious point; the personnel gulf between the wealthy French elite and their Premiership rivals. The English clubs simply can’t compete when the leading Top 14 sides play to their potential, due to the disparity in budgets. Yet again, the salary cap — currently £5.5million — is back on the agenda. ‘There are pros and cons for everything,’ said Young. ‘The salary cap has worked; all the clubs have been sustainable for a long period, it’s the most competitive league in Europe and there have been two or three different title winners in the last few seasons, too. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . ‘It has also meant a lot of young English players are getting exposure at that level, so it has done what it was intended to do. But maybe we need a a re-think about how important Europe is to the English teams and how the salary cap leaves us when playing against the big French teams. ‘Realistically, Premiership teams need a bit of luck to arrive at these games with their best team fit. With the salary cap, there’s no way we can match the massive squads these clubs have.’ Wasps couldn’t match Toulon’s depth of playing resources, but they did trouble the holders thanks to the dynamic efforts of two young Englishmen — centre Elliot Daly and scrum-half Joe Simpson. Their electric running maintained the form Young believes should put them in contention for a place in England’s World Cup squad. ‘I don’t know what more they can do,’ said the Welshman. ‘If England want to win the World Cup, these are the type of players you have to get in your team.’ New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned .

Whatever Villa's Premier League status this summer, Benteke's future will be discussed as his contract, worth £50,000 per week, enters its final two years and the Belgian striker has ambitions to play European football. Wolfsburg have kept tabs on Benteke since before he ruptured his Achilles 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker. The wealthy German club, currently second in Bundesliga, should have funds available from Champions League money, even after their £42million splurge on Chelsea duo Kevin De Bruyne and Andre Schurrle. Christian Benteke celebrates his opening goal against QPR at Villa Park on Tuesday . Villa value their top scorer at £25million however, and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager Tim Sherwood a big fan. Randy Lerner is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts. A hat-trick by Benteke in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers, capped by a brilliant free-kick, underlined his return to form under Sherwood. He has scored seven goals in his last five Villa games, earning the team an additional three points in the process – the current gap to the drop zone. Benteke went on to net a hat-trick which salvaged a vital point for his side . But should Villa slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the Premier League, Benteke is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to £35,000 a week. The 24-year-old would look to leave Villa Park in that scenario, rather than play in the Championship, with a host of clubs likely to express interest. There is, however, no relegation release clause. Even if Villa stay in the Premier League Benteke will assess his options. Two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur following his debut season in England yielding 23 goals. The arrival of Tim Sherwood at Villa Park has rejuvenated Benteke's form in front of goal this season . He signed a new four-year deal on vastly improved terms. Last season was less successful, bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last April ruling Benteke out of the World Cup. His form suffered on return to the side last October, and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under Paul Lambert's regime. Lambert even dropped Benteke in his penultimate game in charge at home to Chelsea. Sherwood's arrival has seen Benteke return to his best, with a goal every 87 minutes. That kind of strike rate should keep Villa up, but also alert top-flight clubs. Spurs are looking to sign young players around the £15million mark, though, while Liverpool would need to shift Mario Balotelli. Jack Grealish is convinced Benteke's goals will ensure Villa's Premier League survival this season . Benteke is comfortable with life in Birmingham and at Villa, but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions. Qualification for the Europa League is still a possibility through the FA Cup for Villa, of course. Teenage winger Jack Grealish, who started his first Premier League match against QPR, is adamant Benteke will help keep Villa safe. 'Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,' he said. 'We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Spurs) positive. 100 per cent we will stay up.'"}

The Tangerines' demotion into the third tier was finally confirmed on Easter Monday and that triggered pre-match public displays of fury from fans at the Oyston family's handling of the club on Tuesday. Dozens of supporters gathered outside the West Stand 45 minutes before kick-off and hurled eggs at the back of the directors' boxes before a flare, smoke bomb and firework were tossed into the cordoned-off area in front of the main reception area. Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead against Reading on Tuesday night . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Blackpool: Lewis (Parish 73); Hall (Maher 50), Clarke, O'Dea, Dunne; Cubero, O'Hara, Perkins, Orlandi (Osavi-Samuel 78), Jacobs; Madine . Goal: O'Hara (pen, 6) Booked: O'Hara . Reading: Federici; Gunter, Pearce, Knight, Obita; McCleary (Mackie 45), Ake, Norwood, Robson-Kanu; Yakubu (Cox 78), Appiah (Pogrebnyak 45) Goal: Hall  (OG, 46) Ref: G. Eltringham . Att: 9,614 . With stewards and police present, the scenes did not descend into violence but the message delivered from those in attendance was clear - they want Oyston to depart a team that this week became the first in the Football League to be relegated. On the pitch, Jamie O'Hara's early penalty was cancelled out by Grant Hall's unfortunate own goal just 20 seconds after the restart as the basement-dwelling Seasiders' winless run was extended to 13 games. Some of the supporters who congregated in front of the West Stand did not even walk into a half-empty stadium for the game and they missed their side taking a sixth-minute lead. Zat Knight got the wrong side of Sheffield Wednesday loanee Gary Madine and tripped him from behind, allowing O'Hara to step up and stroke the resulting penalty into the corner as Adam Federici guessed the wrong way. Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . The cut-up pitch arguably denied the hosts a second as the ball bobbled away from David Perkins, who had orchestrated a three-on-two break, on the edge of the Royals' penalty area. Winger Michael Jacobs then blasted into the side-netting from 25 yards as Blackpool entered the interval with a one-goal lead. That disappeared 20 seconds after the restart, though, when the Royals made a lightning start to the second period. Pavel Pogrebnyak made inroads down the left flank and he squared for Yakubu, whose shot back across goal smashed against the unfortunate Hall before going over the line. Hall stayed on the turf and after woozily returning to his feet, he was replaced by Niall Maher. Perkins bent an effort narrowly past a post but Joe Lewis and Federici remained largely untroubled, as did Blackpool substitute Elliot Parish when he replaced an injured Lewis, with Pogrebnyak's header off target the closest either side came to a winner. The result leaves Lee Clark's side on 25 points, still one point shy of the lowest points tally ever accumulated by a team in the second tier when there have been 24 teams competing."}

Prior to the international break the Reds' 13-match unbeaten league run was ended at home to Champions League-chasing rivals Manchester United, leaving them five points adrift of the qualification places. Defeat at third-placed Arsenal would be a huge blow to their aspirations of returning to Europe's elite for a second successive season. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has urged his team to perform well in the clash with Arsenal on Saturday . Rodgers knows they must avoid a repeat of the disappointing first-half display against United which led to their defeat. 'We've made it difficult for ourselves because of our last performance and result, but it's certainly achievable,' he said of their top-four chances. 'Over the course of the last three months, apart from the last game, we've performed very well and we have got results. 'I think people might look at it (the trip to Arsenal) as a must-win game. For me, it is a must-perform game, we want to perform well and we know that when we do that we've got every chance of winning, whether that's at home or away. Rodgers watches over training as he prepares his side to face Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday . The Liverpool boss addresses his players ahead of the pivotal clash with Arsenal in North London . 'We've had a long two weeks, it's probably one of the few games where after the international break we've had to suffer a little bit, because we didn't perform and lost, but there is extra motivation there to get something from the game and that is something that we clearly want to achieve. 'These final eight games are going to be exciting games and there is still every possibility for us to make the top four.' Many see the two sides as being similar in their approach to how they play, particularly in relation to how they like to keep the ball. That was a feature missing in the United game and it cost them dearly and Rodgers has spent a fortnight over the international break assessing where it went wrong after enjoying so much success in the previous three months. 'Our possession wasn't good enough in our last game,' he added. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is suspended having been sent off against Manchester United . 'The key for us in the first-half against Manchester United was that we didn't keep the ball well enough and, positionally, we were never in position to receive the ball and press the ball. 'We've talked about that, we've analysed that and we've worked on that; in order for us to maximise how we've been working we need to keep the ball better and be technically better. 'That's a huge part of our game, and it's Arsenal's game. But for us, we'll go there and tactically we are very clear on the idea of the game and we need to get something from the game, that's clear. 'But that was the same before we played the Manchester United game; Arsenal was a game that we wanted to ensure that we got at least a point from and that will be the case at the weekend.' Daniel Sturridge trained on Thursday ahead of Liverpool's trip to Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League . 'We'll be going there looking forward to the game and really motivated to get back to winning again.' Liverpool have been boosted by striker Daniel Sturridge's return to training after a hip injury, while fellow England international Adam Lallana is also expected to be fit after pulling out of Roy Hodgson's squad. However, they will be missing centre-back Martin Skrtel, a virtual ever-present in the league this season, as he begins a three-match suspension alongside captain Steven Gerrard."}

Fiercely loyal, brave beyond words, strong and dedicated. At Saracens, who take on Racing Metro in Paris on Sunday in the European Champions Cup quarter-final, the flanker is loved by his team-mates every bit as much as he is loathed by opponents who fear the reckless abandon with which he is prepared to play the game. With a face left battered and bruised by years of punishment, Burger is the man you want on your team. ‘I change into something else when I play rugby, my personality changes,’ said Burger. ‘When I step off the pitch I will be somebody else again. It is pretty weird. You go out there and do your job then you step off and pick up your kids and you are soft again. When it is time to go, there is a switch that turns you on for a big match. Saracens ace Jacques Burger looks to get to grips with Harlequins Marland Yarde . Burger of Saracens tackles Harlequins ace Chris Robshaw in the Aviva Premiership match . ‘My dad always says he doesn’t want to die a healthy man. I don’t want to go down healthy. Hopefully there’ll be a bit of wear and tear. I’m happy to crack on and give 100 per cent every time I get the opportunity.’ Therein lies the challenge facing rugby today. For all we love about these young men who risk serious injury every week in order to entertain us, are the risks becoming too great? Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall described Burger as ‘unique among rugby players’, praising his willingness to ignore risks to his own wellbeing. Burger and Schalk Brits of Saracens tackle Damien Chouly of ASM Clermont Auvergne . Burger  bursts through to score a try during the Aviva Premiership match between Saracens and Harlequins . His continued presence on a rugby field is something of a miracle after undergoing pioneering knee surgery in South Africa more than three years ago which a British specialist refused to carry out because he considered it too extreme. At the very least he will need a full knee replacement in the not-too-distant future. ‘I feel massively blessed,’ said the 31-year-old Namibian farmer’s son from Windhoek. ‘I never thought I’d have come back and played so many games after the surgery. I went through a lot of pain. ‘The physio says I’m a bit like Benjamin Button. I’m going back in time and healing up again. I will probably regret it after rugby when I’m sitting at home having to do some work. But that’s for the future. I’ll worry about that when I get there.’ Sitiveni Sivivatu  is tackled by Burger and Kelly Brown during the Heineken Cup semi final . But while he can be very cavalier with his own body, Burger believes players do need to be protected from themselves at times. ‘It is annoying for players sometimes because you want to crack on and keep playing. But players’ health after rugby has to be the No 1 priority because it is such a short amount of rugby you play in your life.’ The 31-year-old will run out against Racing Metro on Sunday off the back of a performance against Harlequins at Wembley last Saturday that McCall believes was his best since the astonishing man-of-the-match display he produced against Clermont Auvergne in last year’s European semi-final. ‘It’s going to take a big game to bring it home,’ said Burger. ‘The European knockout stages is when you get tested. That’s when some guys become stars and I’m up for that.’"}

The reverse fixture, a 2-2 draw in December, prompted Liverpool’s renaissance into the Premier League’s form team. Thereafter, they went 13 top-flight games without defeat and put themselves in contention to qualify for Europe’s top competition before losing to Manchester United in a drama-filled match two weeks ago. Juan Mata's acrobatic volley two weeks ago left Liverpool five points adrift of Manchester United in fourth . Brendan Rodgers' side need to beat Arsenal on Saturday to keep up their chances of a top-four finish . Liverpool have been in good form since they last played Arsenal, but are not in the Champions League spots . A defeat could leave Liverpool eight points adrift of the top four with just seven games to play, a massive mountain to climb. The statistics suggest victory at the Emirates is an unlikely scenario. In six games against the Premier League’s other top-five sides, Liverpool have won just one and picked up four points compared with Manchester United who have won three of five games against their toughest competition. In Arsenal they face a side who have cemented their Champions League spot with four top-flight wins in as many games in March. For their efforts, Arsene Wenger was given the Manager of the Month award for a 14th time and striker Olivier Giroud the Player of the Month trophy. Liverpool are likely to face a side riding on a wave of confidence and optimism so it will be a tough ask to get a result. With more money on offer than ever before, Liverpool know they need to be at Europe's top table . Raheem Sterling and Phlippe Coutinho train ahead of the vital trip to Arsenal on Saturday . It is not just the pride of fans at stake in this game but also the financial security of the club. A Sportsmail study this week revealed the race for Champion’s League has gained even more importance after UEFA announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season. Cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is increasing by up to 50 per cent, and for English clubs there will also be steep hikes in 'market pool' money from UEFA's TV incomes. If an English club were to win next season's Champions League, they would earn around £75m at today's exchange rates from central UEFA funds alone. Ticket income plus any commercial bonuses would be on top. Under current prize money arrangements, clubs reaching the group stage receive £6.4m each plus £750,000 per group win and £370,000 per draw. The basic fee will rise 40 per cent to  £8.9m and each win will jump 50 per cent to £1.1m. Prize money for reaching the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will leap up 57 per cent, respectively to £4m, £4.44m and £5.2m. The prize for being tournament runner-up will jump from £4.8m to £7.8m while the winner's prize will jump from £7.8m to £11.11m. For a team like Liverpool, who enjoy a big worldwide profile, particularly in Asia, money like that could solidify their position among the European elite for the next decade. Securing European football will also be vital to ensure they attract world-class players and keep the ones they already have at the club. Even with Champions League qualification Liverpool were unable to hold on to Luis Suarez last summer . Sterling's contract situation demonstrates how important it is for Rodgers' side to qualify . The contract wrangling with Raheem Sterling in recent weeks will undoubtedly have been a distraction to the player himself and the focus of manager Brendan Rodgers but they will have to put that to one side if they are to overcome Arsenal. On the Sterling subject, it would be much easier to resolve his future and persuade him to remain in Merseyside come the end of the season if Liverpool have the certainty of Champions League football to offer as an enticement. Players want to compete on the biggest stage they can. Regardless of how much money each week is being offered, the chance to play against the best teams in Europe is priceless."}

After hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a 'deep wound', Negri returned to action in the New Year to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg. Further scans at Ross Hall Hospital showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with HIV/AIDS. However, in his imminent autobiography 'Moody Blue - The Story of the Mysterious Marco', which is serialised in the Daily Record; the now 44-year-old reveals that his worst fears weren't confirmed after flying to Italy for treatment. 'I was immediately hospitalised. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of being HIV positive but the harsh reality was there in front of me in the medical report, and it was hard to ignore and digest,' Negri wrote. In his  autobiography, Negri (left) reveals his nightmare started after a reserve match vs Aberdeen in 2000 . After months of hospital scans in Scotland, Negri (right) was told in Italy that his blood was absolutely fine . 'I didn’t feel able to deal with such a thing alone. I needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in Italy to understand exactly what was going on, the risks and chances of recovery. 'I had to return to Italy, and not on a temporary basis. I asked my lawyer to speak to Rangers about an early dissolution of my contract. 'They had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship, which was something I really appreciated, although it also showed me how serious my condition was. 'Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long to learn I was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee. This diagnosis was given by doctors in Bologna. In Scotland they hadn’t got it right this time, even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that couldn’t be overlooked. 'Further tests found my blood to be absolutely fine and there was no need for medication or invasive treatment. My drama had been resolved in the best way possible, and I put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head.'

Moments after his side's 14-7 loss at Kingsholm, the Kiwi veteran was led away to a police van with the entire incident broadcasted live on TV. Connacht full-back Mils Muliaina makes a run during his side's Challenge Cup match against  Gloucester .

Muliaina's arrest was captured live on Sky Sports following the Challenge Cup quarter-final . Muliaina, who announced this week that he would be moving to Italian club Zebre next season, started at full-back against the Cherry and Whites playing 35 minutes before withdrawing with a leg injury just before half-time. Details of the alleged incident are yet to be confirmed but Muliaina was in action for Connacht against Cardiff on March 6 in a Guinness Pro12 clash at the Cardiff Arms Park. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said: 'A man in his 30s was arrested at Kingsholm Stadium on Friday 3rd April on suspicion of sexual assault in relation to an incident in Cardiff in March. 'The man has been handed over to officers from South Wales Police who are investigating the incident.' Connacht released a statement late on Friday night stating: 'Connacht Rugby can confirm that player Mils Muliaina is currently assisting the South Wales Police with enquiries relating to an alleged incident in Cardiff in March of this year. As this is a legal matter, Connacht Rugby will be making no further comment at this time. Muliaina earned 100 caps for New Zealand and retired following the 2011 World Cup on home soil . A powerful and skillful full-back, Muliaina made his Test debut when he appeared as a replacement in New Zealand's 15-13 loss to England in Wellington. The Samoa-born player quickly established himself as first-choice No 15 featuring in the subsequent Tri-Nations series and the 2003 World Cup. Muliaina was ever-present in the black jersey for the next few seasons and played a starring role in the All Blacks side that demolished the British and Irish Lions 3-0 in the 2005 series.

Israel Dagg's emergence seemed to spell the end of Muliaina's All Blacks career but he still made it to his third World Cup campaign in 2011 and played his final Test against Argentina in the quarter-final in Auckland winning his 100th cap in the process. A shoulder injury put an end to his tournament, however, as his country went on to lift the William Webb Ellis trophy. A two-year spell playing with NTT Docomo Red Hurricanes in Japan followed before he returned for second stint with the Chiefs back in New Zealand.

Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League . United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield . The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half . However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday . 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.' United and England midfielder Michael Carrick has been singled out for his strong performance against Italy ."}

Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters. As he launched the party's 'policies for women' alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and MEP Diane James, Mr O'Flynn was forced to defend its 'blokeish' image under Nigel Farage. Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters . Polls suggest around 15 per cent of men are planning to back Ukip, compared to only 10 per cent of women. Mr O'Flynn: 'Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. 'But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. 'We're a very fast-growing party, we're increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we're not maximising our support in every potential group. 'And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we've got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.' The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is often photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer . The party used the event confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a 'tampon tax'. It also said it would give 'absolute, full and unconditional' support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are 'properly resourced'. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is 'accepted cultural practice' for some of 'our ethnic compatriots'. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party. She said: 'I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. 'There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. 'Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.' Suzanne Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party . Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as 'sluts'. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women's event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave.

With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for £2million in January. Afobe has made himself instantly at home and has Leeds in his sights today. Final word to the English forward: 'Every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won.'

'We talked about needing to make a good start and shutting the crowd up, but completely the opposite happened,' Mallinder said. 'Clermont made a cracking start, put us under pressure and we clearly didn't compete in the first half in any of the areas. 'The set piece didn't function. The physicality wasn't there. We couldn't keep hold of the ball, spilling it too often. Our kicking and kick chase were also poor.' Clermont and Northampton players vie in a scrum during the match  at the Michelin stadium . Northampton's Ken Pisi is tackled by Clermont's French centre Wesley Fofana . Northampton's status as Premiership champions points to a gulf in class between the English and French leagues that Mallinder was in no hurry to deny. 'The top French teams are very, very good. And at times we are very good, but not in this match,' Mallinder said. 'On this performance it would be hard to argue against it (there being a gulf in class), but we have competed against their top sides in the past.'

'I was there the day he walked in to the club and he made some changes about three days after that. He got rid of George Graham and brought in Glenn Hoddle, that was in the weeks building up to the FA Cup semi final. 'He is not frightened of making decisions at crucial times.

That gives me immense pride. 'You have to give a lot of credit to Pochettino for sticking with them boys also. A lot of managers would have gone 'no thank you, give me some of those players who end in an I or an O from foreign countries, who might not be as good as these young players'.

Dereck Chisora is being lined up for a summer comeback against British heavyweight rival David Price . 'Del Boy' has not boxed since he was stopped by switch-hitting Tyson Fury at London's ExCeL Arena . Chisora has been regrouping and recovering from an eye injury sustained during the 10-round beating . But his promoter Frank Warren has confirmed that Chisora has been back in the gym for the past month and is hoping to make his return to the ring during the summer. However he will be without his long-term trainer, friend and mentor Don Charles after the pair parted company. It was Charles who nurtured the young fighter through a short amateur career and all of his 25 pro fights to date. Warren said: 'Dereck's back in the gym and we will be announcing something for him very soon. Hopefully he will make his comeback in the summer. 'In that last fight, Tyson Fury did brilliantly and Dereck had a lot of problems with his eye and he has had to have something done to his eye. His promoter Frank Warren has confirmed that Chisora has been back in the gym for the past month . 'He has had to recuperate, it has had to heal but now that is out of the way. Now we can move on and get himself back in the game. 'He really fancies it, he wants to fight and the one thing about Dereck Chisora is that he is what he is: a fighter. He just loves it.' Warren has arranged a show at Wembley Arena on May 9 which rivals Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr will both feature on. It had been suggested that Chisora may make a low-key comeback as part of the undercard but Warren dismissed the idea. Instead the promoter is plotting a route towards an all-English showdown with David Price. Like Chisora, the 2008 Olympic bronze medalist is rebuilding following back-to-back knock-out defeats to Tony Thompson in 2013. Price teamed up with Sauerland Promotions and boxed three times last year and once in February, winning all four, and Warren thinks he would be a good match for Chisora.

Joshua in action against Denis Bakhtov during their WBC International Heavyweight Championship match . But Warren insists he would have no problem putting Chisora in with him. 'Joshua is also a target for Dereck, don't worry about that,' he said. 'Joshua is out in Newcastle this weekend and then May 30 so let's see where he goes. 'We also have to see what they're going to do with Anthony Joshua but that's another big domestic fight between two guys from the same area. 'It just shows there are some big fights for Dereck in this division. It's not like he's coming back and scratching around for fights, there are a lot of options.'"}

Palace piled the pressure on the Chilean with an outstanding win that was secured by goals from Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon. It leaves City in fourth place, nine points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, and sweating on qualification for next season’s Champions League. City, who hit back with a late Sergio Aguero goal, were furious that Murray’s opener was allowed to stand, feeling it should have been disallowed for offside, and they surrounded referee Michael Oliver to protest. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini witnessed his side limp to a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace . Pellegrini believes that Palace's first goal, scored by stirker Glenn Murray, was clearly offside . Murray celebrates giving Palace the lead in the first half with a close range finish . The result places further uncertainty on Pellegrini’s future but he insisted he does not fear the axe. ‘Am I concerned for my job? No. I’m never concerned about my job,’ said Pellegrini, who next up face rivals United at Old Trafford on Sunday. ‘I do my work and am very happy. You maybe have a difficult season, but you never worry about things like this.’ When asked about his players crowding referee Oliver after the first goal from Murray, Pellegrini, who felt his side should have been awarded a second-half penalty when Palace striker Murray handled in the box, replied: ‘Because it was a clear offside. In the first minute, there was another clear offside. Jason Puncheon gave Palace a 2-0 lead against City when the midfielder scored with a superb free-kick . Puncheon's goal proved decisive for Palace, who are now up to 11th in the Premier League table . Yaya Toure scored a consolation goal for City as they lost more ground on league leaders Chelsea . ‘The mistake the referee can do, but there was also after that a clear penalty, and a lot of things happened in the game.’ Pellegrini added: ‘You ask me the same question every time (about the title race) and I give the same answer: we are not thinking about Chelsea and titles. We go each game and try to win. At the end of the season, we will see.’ Palace manager Alan Pardew heaped praise on his side, who virtually guaranteed their top-flight status with victory. ‘It’s a great night for us, fabulous for the club. We have 39 points on the board, so we’d like to think we’ll be back here next year. Crystal Palace has worked wonders since joining the club from Newcastle United back in January this year . ‘My job gets more difficult now after beating the champions here. Expectations will be higher. We have to keep on improving on it. ‘There wasn’t too much of a secret tonight. It was about resilience and good organisation. Great character in the team. ‘It was an important first goal tonight to set the mood for the game. We managed to get it. ‘We got a bit of luck, there were some scary moments — about 23 of them, I counted. ‘But we managed to see it through. You have to pay credit to these players. There were some real sustained attacks from City, showing tremendous character to keep their heads up at 2-0 down, got a great goal and I feared it was going to be a draw, but it was our night tonight. ‘Sometimes it is. We had a break with the first goal, which looks offside. But sometimes you deserve them.

Only Tour members can play on the team and Phoenix-based Casey gave up his membership after deciding in January to concentrate on the PGA Tour in order to get back into the world's top 50. The move has paid off with the former world No 3 losing a play-off in the Northern Trust Open and finishing joint third in the Honda Classic to climb to 44th at the start of this week. Paul Casey, practicing ahead of the Masters in Augusta, 'desperately' wants to return to the Ryder Cup . The Englishman has returned to the world's top 50 after leaving the European Tour to concentrate on his game . However, even if he rejoins the European Tour before the May 1 deadline to be eligible to accrue Ryder Cup points when the race starts in August, he will struggle to play the 13 events required for membership. 'It was very straightforward when I was top 10 in the world playing both tours,' Casey told Sportsmail ahead of his first Masters appearance since 2012. 'I know I am back in the top 50 but I have only just got back into the top 50. It was a very difficult decision but it was also the correct decision. 'I still have to play 13 events and right now I am not in the US Open or Open or HBSC Champions at the end of the year. Playing 13 becomes difficult when you haven't played at the start of the year in Middle East.' Casey celebrates while watching a replay of his hole-in-one, which helped Europe to victory in 2006 . Casey last played in the Ryder Cup competition in the 2008 defeat by USA at Valhalla . Casey played in the record Ryder Cup wins in 2004 and 2006 and the 2008 defeat at Valhalla, but was in tears after being overlooked for a wild card by captain Colin Montgomerie in 2010, when he was ranked seventh in the world. 'I desperately want to be part of a Ryder Cup again. There is definitely passion and a fire there burning,' he added. 'Certainly one of them I felt like I was maybe denied, the others I haven't been in a position to make the team and watching Medinah and Gleneagles has been brilliant. 'What they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and I want to be part of that again and not just part of it, but a real solid team player and leader in the team room, which I know I can be. When I play my best golf I think I can certainly play that kind of role.' European captain Darren Clarke said earlier this week he wanted Casey on his team for Hazeltine next year, and the 37-year-old added: 'Paul (McGinley) said the same thing (even though I was a member of the Tour at the time). 'He was desperate for me to be part of that because I had won twice around Gleneagles and unfortunately wasn't playing the golf I needed to.' Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right), speaking with Tiger Woods in Augusta, wants Casey on his team . Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and is relishing being back at Augusta National after failing to qualify in 2013 and 2014. 'When you have been here and gone away for a year or two you certainly appreciate it when you come back,' he added. 'I'm very focused this week but I am enjoying being here and lapping up everything about it. 'I was on the same flight as Padraig Harrington (who was also ineligible last year) on Sunday and when we landed the girls who run the courtesy car service here had all made little signs saying 'Welcome back Padraig'. We touched on that subject and said that we were both going to give it a good go, but enjoy it.'"}

Sterling's commitment to Liverpool is in doubt after he gave a televised interview on Wednesday explaining why he has chosen to put talks over a new deal on hold. As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, Chelsea are interested in the 20-year-old and have been asked to be kept updated on his future. Arsenal are also keen on the England international. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal with Liverpool . Jose Mourinho insists that he would sell any of his Chelsea players if they did not want to play for the club . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is adamant that Sterling will not be sold in the summer transfer window . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will play Sterling at Arsenal in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash despite the player admitting that he is 'flattered' by interest from the north London club. Rodgers insists Sterling is not for sale this summer at any price, despite his reluctance to sign an extension. But Mourinho said: 'I don't like players that don't want to play for me and my club. My opinion is every player has a price. 'It doesn't matter which player. If you ask me, for example, do I want Eden Hazard to leave Chelsea? No. If he wants to leave and doesn't want to work with me, doesn't want to play for Chelsea, does he have a price? I think he has. But I also understand the philosophy of managers and clubs who want to keep the players at any price. My philosophy is not better than that, it's just mine.' Mourinho and Chelsea are interested in Sterling and could make a move for him at the end of the season . Sterling will start against Arsenal  despite admitting it was 'quite flattering' to be linked with the Gunners . Mourinho watches Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Filipe Luis and Nemanja Matic (L-R) in training at Cobham on Friday . Rodgers has resisted the temptation to leave out Sterling on Saturday after a turbulent three days following his revelation of the reasons for stalling over a new £100,000-a-week contract. Sterling's remarks about being flattered by Arsenal's interest have only added to suspicions that his representatives are trying to engineer a move to London. But Rodgers believes that Sterling will react 'very strongly' to the situation and has the right temperament to handle a game that Liverpool need to win to close a six-point gap on Arsenal in the race for a top-four finish. 'He will play,' said the Liverpool boss. 'If it was a different player I would maybe have something to think about. But with this kid, since he has come in, trained and worked with me, he has been phenomenal and I expect him to go there and perform at a high level. 'I think he is a strong character. He's a young boy, still learning, on and off the field, but I don't think there was anything derogatory to Liverpool. I know he loves the club and I expect him to perform at a high level.' Rodgers says he expects Sterling to 'perform at a high level' against Arsenal despite his contract wrangle . Sterling has attracted interest from clubs including Arsenal, Manchester City and Bayern Munich . Kolo Toure, pictured being challenged by Steven Gerrard, believes Sterling should remain at Anfield . Kolo Toure, meanwhile, has warned that leaving Anfield could see Sterling end up on the scrapheap at another club, in a similar way that occurred with Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair at Manchester City. The English pair, who used to play with Toure at City, played just nine Premier League games between them after moving to the Etihad. Toure told the Liverpool Echo: 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he would not be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. He needs to stay here. This is the best place for him.'"}

Known for its empowering campaigns and championing of real women, Dove has taken a more brutal approach in its latest advertisement. Showing the harsh criticism that women regularly heap upon themselves, Dove decided to see what would happen when somebody else said those things, to their faces. Scroll down for video . For the new One Beautiful Thought ad campaign, Dove asked a group of women to write down every thought they had about themselves. The women filled in a notebook each, and handed it back to Dove . Unbeknownst to the women, those negative remarks and self-body shaming were turned into a script . Created in France, Dove asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook. The beauty brand then took the notes away with them. Unbeknownst to the women, those criticisms, negative remarks and tirades of self body-shaming were turned into a script. What happened next, shocked them all. Dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script, created using the notes each of the women made about themselves, while they were all within earshot. Their reactions were priceless . The comments featured in the actresses' scripted dialogue were harsh, cutting and bordering on bullying . Played out by two actresses, the script was read aloud as dialogue in a cafe, where the women themselves had been invited for coffee. In the experiment set up by Dove, the women heard the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other, out loud. Making for a shocking scene, the script, which contained nothing but the original notes, was cutting to say the least. One woman felt insecure about her teeth, noting that she thought they made her look like a mouse . When the actresses repeated the insecurity out loud, while sitting on the next table, her shock was obvious . In one scenario, a customer sitting on a nearby table, not involved in the experiment, even intervenes. 'Your arms are too big, your silhouette is all squashed,' reads one remark written by a woman who looks no bigger than a size eight. 'Sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big,' the same woman continues. Several of the women's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we'd all frown upon .

Many of the comments written in the notebooks, when said out loud, underline the way lots of women are effectively bullying themselves every single day, by focusing on their insecurities and never their beauty . If you wouldn't speak so harshly to a friend, why do it to yourself? The One Beautiful Thought campaign is yet another in Dove's line of powerful videos, which all aim to encourage women to be kinder to themselves and each other .

From out of the blue, it was the scarlet red of Ferrari that was back on the top step of the podium for the first time in almost two years last time out in Malaysia, pushing reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg down to second and third. From the threat of another Silver Arrows-dominated campaign in the wake of last year's stunning success and crushing start to the season in Australia, Formula One was provided with a much-needed tonic with Ferrari's return to winning ways courtesy of Sebastian Vettel. Sebastian Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . Vettel (right) won the second race of the season following Mercedes' dominance last year . That led to speculation Wolff was prepared to ask for more funds from the Mercedes board to ensure his team stayed ahead of the pack. But a dismissive Wolff said: 'We have everything we need. 'We feel confident in the resources we have, the staff we have, and that we are well-placed. 'We just need to stay calm, continue to develop and put the right things on the car. 'Maybe we put some things earlier on the car than planned, but there is no reason to panic. 'We are back into a regular racing season where you have more than just one contender, and more than one-twos every single weekend. It's back to normal business.' Mercedes chief Toto Wolff claims the champions will just keep calm and carry on . Mercedes will look into reasons why the team was beaten into second and third in Malaysia . Wolff insists his team has left no stone unturned since the race in Malaysia in a bid to uncover what went wrong, even though most teams would jump through hoops for a two-three finish. 'Although we had two cars on the podium, we have been looking very carefully at every area where we could have performed better,' said Wolff. 'Our opposition has raised its game and we must now raise ours even further. 'As we have said since Melbourne, we expect a season-long battle for both world championships and we must maximise every opportunity. Rosberg (left) and Hamilton visited Mercedes' Brackley base to go through their cars on Thursday . 'China is the next chance to do that - a circuit which has been a good hunting ground for the team. 'Lewis has a great record here, and for Nico it's where he made his first step into the winners' circle. 'We have the weapons at our disposal and we need to make the most of them this weekend.' Hamilton is a three-time winner at the Shanghai International Circuit - including last year - whilst he has been on the podium on three other occasions. Rosberg, meanwhile, was second to Hamilton last year after triumphing in 2012. Like Wolff, Hamilton knows more can and will be done, as he said: 'Malaysia was a tough weekend. Hamilton heads to Shanghai having won the Chinese Grand Prix last year on his way to the title . 'It always is with the heat, but with car problems on Friday, rain during qualifying on Saturday and a race which didn't go to plan on Sunday, that one was particularly challenging. 'Ultimately we made the best choices we could, but there is always room for improvement and we've been working hard to analyse everything for the next race in China. 'The circuit is one I really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well. 'I won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice, so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front.' The British driver is congratulated by film star Arnold Schwarzenegger after winning the Australian Grand Prix . From his perspective, Rosberg is far from happy with his two races to date which have seen him finish second and third. 'It's not been a perfect start to my sixth year with the team and I'm determined to turn that around this weekend,' insisted Rosberg. 'Of course, my team-mate will have other ideas, so will my compatriot in the red car (Vettel) I'm sure. 'But this is a track that has always suited me well, so I'm aiming to put in a strong weekend.'"}

Gooch appeared on BBC Radio Five Live on Sunday morning and took a broadly supportive stance of Pietersen, who has re-signed for Surrey in an attempt to stage an unlikely Test return.

Kevin Pietersen has lashed out at Graham Gooch for commenting on his attempted England comeback . Gooch (above) went as far as saying Pietersen had 'wiped the floor with the ECB' in the lengthy PR battle since his sacking in 2014. The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . But Pietersen appeared to take exception to Gooch's suggestion that a Test series victory in the West Indies this month would take the 34-year-old's name off the agenda. He retweeted a BBC Online article and then posted a brief but pointed attack on Gooch, relating to his captaincy on the 1982 rebel tour of Apartheid-era South Africa. It read: 'Graham Gooch - you captained a rebel tour of SA, got banned & then returned to the England team. I don't think I've done anything as bad!' Earlier, Pietersen had suggested his first practice session of the season could be streamed live to fans. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . Pietersen has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. He announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers and raised the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? £comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '£comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has offered just enough encouragement for him to believe he could once again wear the Three Lions - despite a year of bitter recriminations and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge public opinion and the selectors from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Controversial batsman Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship . Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison. Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy. He was then belittled as a nagging 'woodpecker' in the batsman's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch. Asked at Gatwick about the situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.' He would, therefore, seem an unlikely viewer of Pietersen's Periscope net session."}

'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’ Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up . QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference. Sherwood and Ramsey, a duo operating as boss and assistant last season at Spurs, will share words in advance. ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’ Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other . The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe. First half goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, who scored a wonderful lob with the outside of his left boot, did the damage. Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday . Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead . Austin’s strike was his 16th in the Premier League this season and Barton suggested he would have an England cap by now were he in a more fashionable side. ‘It helps if you play for certain clubs to play for England,’ said the QPR midfielder. ‘Certain people who haven’t done as well as Charlie, who has scored so many goals in a struggling side, seem to be shoo-ins in the England side.’ QPR captain Joey Barton celebrates his goal, his team's fourth, late in the game at The Hawthorns ."}

The First Utility Super League leaders were without their inspirational captain, who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015, for the third successive game on Good Friday, but they continue to thrive without him. The Rhinos had beaten Wigan and Catalans Dragons in Sinfield's absence and added Castleford to that list thanks to an excellent team performance, with young winger Ash Handley particularly impressive up against the formidable Justin Carney. Leeds Rhino's Adam Cuthbertson celebrates a try with Jamie Peacock (left) Ryan Hall was sent to the sin-bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but Castleford failed to take advantage and it was the Rhinos who struck first as Joel Moon scored his first try of the season. Hall made amends by extending Leeds' lead and Stevie Ward's converted try cancelled out Michael Shenton's effort to give the Rhinos a 16-6 half-time lead. There were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute, when Hall completed his double. Adam Cuthbertson then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite Shenton's late second, Leeds extended their unbeaten run against the Tigers to six matches. Leeds Rhino's Joel Moon scores the first try for his side during their victory . Brian McDermott warned the Rhinos to be wary of a fast start by Castleford and although it was Leeds who came out of the blocks quickest, the Tigers were handed an early advantage when Hall was sent to the sin-bin for a professional foul. Leeds youth product Luke Gale failed to exploit the gap in the Rhinos' left side when his pass to James Clare from the resultant penalty floated forwards. Liam Sutcliffe was next to fluff his lines as he spilled the ball reaching for the tryline, but Leeds did not have to wait much longer for their first try of the afternoon. The Rhinos rolled downfield after a knock-on by Scott Moore, and Danny McGuire exchanged passes with Brad Singleton before putting Moon through a hole to score. Hall had returned to the field just in time to congratulate his team-mate and he was celebrating a try of his own soon after. Leeds Rhino's Ryan Hall goes over the line for their third try of the clash . McGuire was hauled down just short of the line after Moon's break but Cuthbertson kept his cool on the next play to give Hall an easy finish in the corner. Sutcliffe landed the touchline conversion to give Leeds a 10-0 lead. The Rhinos went in search of a crucial third try - with Brett Delaney just held up over the line - but their lead was cut to four points when Shenton reacted quickest to Liam Finn's dab through and Gale kicked a goal from out wide. The momentum was suddenly with Castleford as they probed for another try to level up the contest, but such was its nature that Leeds re-established their 10-point lead. Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield sat out during the week he announced he was switching codes . Kallum Watkins played a big part in taking the Rhinos close to the Tigers' line and Sutcliffe's neat reverse kick sat up nicely for Ward to get downward pressure on the ball. Good defence by Sutcliffe denied Shenton his second try at the start of the second half before Cuthbertson was held up over the line at the other end. The excitement continued as Carney picked up a loose Leeds pass well inside his own half and raced clear seemingly destined to score, only for McGuire to slow him down with an ankle tap before Handley hauled him down. Leeds Rhino's Zak Hardaker makes a run during the Super League match at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle . Carney then turned try-saver when he stopped Zak Hardaker finishing off a Rhinos break and Leeds were denied by more impressive Castleford defence as Singleton was held up. The visitors finally broke through for a fourth time when McGuire spotted his side had numbers on the left and found Moon, who gave Hall another simple task in the corner. Australian forward Cuthbertson continued his fine first season in England with a powerful finish, but the Tigers had the last word as Shenton exchanged passes with Carney to score."}

England dominated against a modest St Kitts & Nevis XI, dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply. The quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session, though Stokes still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10. Alastair Cook plays behind square on his way to an unbeaten 95 in the tour match against a St Kitts' XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . More important for England's Test prospects, though, was the stand of 158 between Cook (95 not out) and Trott (72). Both men needed the comfort of big runs, Cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the World Cup and Trott on his first England appearance since November 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety. He now has the chance to nail down the role of Cook's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances. 'Trotty and Cooky gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the Test matches,' said Stokes. Ben Stokes spoke strongly about his team-mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease . Stokes had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball, as England dominated the day . 'The biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle. You can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today. Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left. To see him go out and score some runs, the way he has been known to for England over the last five years, was really good to see.' Stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of Cook's knock, but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores, it could yet prove an important effort. Stokes described his captain Cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form . 'It was fantastic for Cooky too,' said Stokes. 'He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great. The tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away, which was good to see.' For his part, Stokes looks a certainty to return to the Test side in the Caribbean. Having announced himself as an all-rounder of unusual promise in the 2013-14 Ashes, he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year. He did not even make the cut for the World Cup but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form. Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . 'It was nice to make an impact back in the first game, even if it was just a warm-up game in an England shirt,' he said. 'I still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well. 'I'm still working very hard on getting back into the team, which is what I want to do. Hopefully that is just the start. 'I need performances to back that up. To keep my place I know I need to keep performing, which is something I haven't been consistent with since Australia so hopefully I get a chance in the Test matches here and I can build on that.'"}

A medal-winning Olympic gymnast of course...and even a Strictly Come Dancing champion. However, it appears the athlete, 25, is gaining expertise in an area previously dominated by queen of the 'Belfie', Kim Kardashian. Yes, Louis Smith, MBE, is now also very good at exciting his fans with selfies. Topless selfies, where we're treated to a view of his rippling muscles in full flexed action, to be more specific. If you've got it, flaunt it: Former Olympic gymnast, Louis Smith,  is constantly sharing images of his honed torso with an endless stream of topless selfies on Instagram . The Strictly Come Dancing star shot to fame after winning both a bronze and silver medal at the 2012 London Olympic Games . Mostly taken between the pine door of his stone wall bathroom and what can only be an impressively large mirror, Louis' selfies have become something of a phenomenon. So much so, that when interviewed by the Telegraph recently, primarily about his latest project to help communities learn how to dance, they felt compelled to ask him about it. 'I’m just sharing my physique,' the hunk of the gymnastics world said of his snaps. 'I’m just sharing my physique,' the hunk of the gymnastics world said of his snaps in an interview . Some of which, are far saucier than others. For example, there are pics taken in his bathroom where he's clearly wearing jeans, despite the lack of a shirt. Others, however, have ranged from a view of his very tight boxers, to a topless sunbathing selfie where nothing but a strategically placed cocktail glass covered up a full frontal view of his manhood. 'I work hard to get the body I have, so why not show off what I’ve got?' the athlete added. 'I work hard to get the body I have, so why not show off what I’ve got?' says the athlete.

As if we needed the proof, here it is, a topless selfie taken at the gym no less. But while it appears that Louis needs little to no encouragement on the selfie front, his blossoming relationship with TOWIE's Lucy Mecklenburgh is sure to only fuel his habit.

Of course, they've got the selfies to prove it . 'Having someone to share things with was the one thing missing from my puzzle,' says Louis of his girlfriend Lucy Mecklenburgh, also a fitness fanatic and avid selfie taker . Though the pair have been together for just four months, they've both been extremely open about their feelings for each other. 'Having someone to share things with was the one thing missing from my puzzle, so it’s lovely to be with Lucy,' the Strictly champ said.

Surrey paceman Tremlett believes England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Downton's departure on Wednesday night opens the door for controversial batsman Pietersen's return. South Africa-born Pietersen is gearing up for his first county championship action since June 2013 after agreeing a new deal with Surrey. Chris Tremlett has backed his Surrey team-mate Kevin Pietersen to make an international comeback . Tremlett and Pietersen were all smiles on Surrey's media day at The Oval ahead of the new season . The 34-year-old is determined to restart his Test career after he was sacked in February 2014, and Tremlett backed his county team-mate to achieve that feat. 'Maybe that's the case that those changes open a door,' said Tremlett of Downton's ECB exit. 'They were the guys who were in place that I guess made those rulings that he wasn't going to come back and play for England. 'People have heard things from Colin Graves the last few weeks that he might have a chance of coming back. 'I guess it's just wait and see, who knows what's going to happen in the next few weeks, other positions could change within the England set-up. Pietersen cancelled his Indian Premier League contract in order to play domestic cricket for Surrey . 'But I think Kevin knows he's got a chance if he goes out there and scores runs. 'I think he feels he was harshly treated by being released from the ECB a year or so ago, so I think he's got a point to prove and it will be exciting to see what happens. 'I don't see why he can't get back into the England set-up. 'There's been a couple of changes over the last couple of days with England, and I don't know what's going to happen there. 'But I'm sure if he stacks up a lot of runs then people are going to be pushing for him to get back in the England side. 'It will be interesting to see how it unravels in the next five or six weeks. The 34-year-old takes a snap on his phone during the media day at The Oval on Thursday . 'But from Surrey's point of view we're all hoping he gets out there and scores big runs.' Pietersen was back at The Oval on Thursday for Surrey's pre-season press day, posing for team photographs. The 104-Test veteran's England career went up in smoke during the disastrous 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia, with accusations and back-biting of dressing room unrest. Captain Gareth Batty claimed the Surrey dressing room is 'even better' with Pietersen around, playing down any chances of the returning star causing any backroom imbalance. 'I can only comment on things I've seen with my own eyes,' said Batty. Pietersen has not played for England since England's disastrous Ashes Tour in 2013 . Paul Downton was sacked from his position as managing director of England cricket . 'But if you go up into that changing room now, Kev will be up there taking the mickey out of someone - and someone will be taking the mickey out of him back. 'It's a very nice place to be. 'I enjoy coming to work every morning. 'Whether Kev's there or not it's a nice place to be, if anything with Kev there it's even better because there's a bit more banter, a few more of you boys kicking around and there's a bit more fun to be had at everybody else's expense. 'So it's always been a good place when Kevin's been around. 'I think he's very motivated, and I think there's a bit of fuel there that's motivating him on a daily basis. 'All I see is a young fella, who is desperate to play cricket, and desperate to get back to his absolute best.'"}
