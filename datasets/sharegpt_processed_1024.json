Identify the target audience and their needs: Understand the ideal customer for the product or service, and create a messaging that resonates with them.\n2. Pre-launch: Build anticipation and excitement for the launch by creating buzz, gathering testimonials and case studies, and using social media to create awareness.\n3. Launch: Use a well-crafted launch sequence to maximize sales and conversions. This can include offering bonuses, creating scarcity, and using a deadline to create urgency.\n4. Post-launch: Follow up with customers, gather feedback, and continue to provide value to keep them engaged and loyal.\n5. Create a product suite: Once the initial product is successful, expand the offering by creating additional products or services that address other needs of the same audience.\n6. Continual optimization: Continually monitor and optimize the launch process and product suite to improve results.\n7. Build a community: Use the launch process to build a community of customers who are passionate about the product and can help spread the word.\n8. Use automation: Use technology and automation to streamline the launch process and improve efficiency."

We then pass these values to the `replacePlaceholders()` method, which iterates over the entries in the `replacements` map and replaces each placeholder in the input string with its corresponding value using the `replace()` method. Finally, the `replacePlaceholders()` method returns the modified string, which is printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```csharp\nThis is a new student at point 3, 4\n```\nNote that you can modify the `replacements` map to include additional placeholders and their corresponding values, and the `replacePlaceholders()` method will automatically replace them in the input string."

So when the `getline` function is called to read the `player_sex` string, it immediately reads the newline character left in the input stream and stops reading, resulting in an empty string being stored in the `player_sex` variable.\n\nTo avoid this issue, the `getline` function is called again after reading the integer value, this time storing the input in the `dummy` variable. Since `dummy` is not used anywhere else in the function, it serves only to consume the leftover newline character and allow the next `getline` call to read the correct input."

Here's a technical overview of a referral system similar to Dropbox's, but instead of free space, users will earn \"credits\" for every three friends they recommend.\n\n1. Database schema:\nTo implement this referral system, you'll need a database schema to store user information and their referral relationships. The schema should include the following tables:\n* Users: This table will store basic user information like user\\_id, email, username, and total\\_credits.\n* Referrals: This table will store referral relationships, including referrer\\_id (the user who sent the referral), referee\\_id (the invited user), and referral\\_status (whether the referral is pending, accepted, or rejected).\n1. Unique referral links:\nTo track referrals, generate unique referral links for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, associate their account with the referrer's user\\_id. This can be achieved by appending a referral code (such as a unique hash) to the signup URL, which can be mapped back to the referrer's user\\_id.\n2. Referral tracking and credit calculation:\nTrack the number of successful referrals for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, update the Referrals table with the new relationship and set the referral\\_status to 'pending'. Once the new user completes the necessary steps to qualify as a successful referral (e.g., email verification, account activation), update the referral\\_status to 'accepted'.\n\nPeriodically (or using a trigger), calculate the number of successful referrals for each user. For every three successful referrals, award the referrer with additional credits. Update the Users table to reflect the new credit balance.\n\n1. API endpoints:\nDevelop the following API endpoints to support the referral system:\n* GET /referral-link: Generate and return a unique referral link for the logged-in user.\n* POST /signup: Create a new user account and process the referral, if any. This should include validating the referral code, associating the new user with the referrer, and updating the Referrals table.\n* GET /referral-status: Retrieve the referral status and credit balance for the logged-in user.\n1. Frontend integration:\nIntegrate the referral system into your application's frontend by adding the following components:\n* Referral link sharing: Allow users to share their unique referral link via email, social media, or other messaging platforms.\n* Referral status dashboard: Display the user's referral status, including the number of successful referrals and their credit balance.\n* In-app notifications: Notify users when they've earned additional credits from successful referrals.\n1. Analytics and monitoring:\nMonitor the performance of the referral system, tracking metrics such as the number of successful referrals, credits awarded, and the conversion rate of referred users. Use this data to optimize the referral process and identify potential issues.\n\nIn summary, the proposed referral system will involve creating a database schema to store user and referral information, generating unique referral links, tracking referrals and awarding credits, and integrating these features into your application's frontend."

Once you have your project set up, you can install the necessary libraries using npm.\n\nThe next step is to create a new component that will render the 3D canvas using ThreeJS and the Drei library. In this component, you will need to import the necessary ThreeJS and Drei modules. You will also need to set up a camera and controls for the 3D canvas, as well as any lighting you want to use. Finally, you will need to add an event listener to capture user input, such as mouse clicks or mouse movements. When the user interacts with the canvas, you can convert their input into 3D geometry and update the canvas accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a basic ThreeJS scene with a camera and lighting:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber'\n\nconst ThreeCanvas = () => {\n  const camera = useRef()\n\n  return (\n    <Canvas>\n      <perspectiveCamera ref={camera} position={[0, 0, 5]} />\n      <ambientLight />\n      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />\n    </Canvas>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ThreeCanvas\n```\nThe next step is to create a new component that will render the 2D drawing tool. In this component, you will need to import the necessary ReactJS modules. You will also need to set up event listeners to capture user input, such as mouse clicks or mouse movements. When the user interacts with the drawing tool, you can update the canvas with their input, such as drawing lines or shapes. You can also display the vertices of the shape/s in a sidebar component.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a basic ReactJS component that captures user input:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nconst DrawingTool = () => {\n  const [vertices, setVertices] = useState([])\n\n  const onPointerDown = (event) => {\n    // Handle user input here\n  }\n\n  const onPointerMove = (event) => {\n    // Handle user input here\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <svg\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"100%\"\n        onPointerDown={onPointerDown}\n        onPointerMove={onPointerMove}\n      >\n        {/* Render drawing tool here */}\n      </svg>\n      <ul>\n        {vertices.map((vertex, index) => (\n          <li key={index}>\n            {vertex.x}, {vertex.y}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default DrawingTool\n```\nFinally, you will need to style your components using CSS. You can use CSS to customize the look and feel of your drawing tool and canvas, as well as the layout of your sidebar component.\n\nThat's a high-level overview of how to create a simple drawing app using ReactJS and ThreeJS with the Drei library. I hope this helps!"

These holding companies are mostly registered as LLCs, or Limited Liability Companies.\n\nThe properties listed in the data include residential and commercial properties, such as penthouse apartments, office spaces, and land for horse and shooting sports. Many of the properties are located in Florida, specifically in Miami and Palm Beach, and some are located in Illinois and Colorado.\n\nSome of the properties listed in the data have been sold, and some have been withdrawn from the market. For example, 14 STAR ISLAND LLC, was incorporated in August 2020 but withdrawn in October 2022. It appears that the 14 STAR ISLAND property was held by NAUTILUS HOLDINGS I LLC before it was sold on October 5, 2022.\n\nThe data also indicates that there are some common names appearing multiple times, such as KP HOLDINGS LLC, which is listed as the sole member for multiple holding companies. Similarly, there are multiple companies listed with similar names, such as 1BUSINESS GROUP LLC and BUSINESS GROUP LLC, which suggests that these companies may be related.\n\nIn summary, the data provided is a list of holding companies for various properties across the United States, mostly located in Florida. These holding companies are registered as LLCs, and they have been used to hold properties for various purposes, such as residential and commercial use. Some of the properties have been sold, and some have been withdrawn from the market. The data also suggests that there are some common names appearing multiple times and some companies listed with similar names."

One thing I've noticed is that a lot of these entities have similar names, such as \"Citadel Clearing LLC\" and \"Citadel Miami HQ\". This suggests that they may be connected in some way. Additionally, some of the entities have hypothesized acronyms listed next to them, like \"CE TM\" for \"Citadel Enterprise Trademark Holdings\". This could be a clue that these entities have specific purposes within the larger organization.\n\n/u/CruxHub: Interesting, what else have you found?\n\nAlice: Well, I've also noticed that some of the entities are based in foreign countries, like \"CITADEL SECURITIES CANADA ULC\" and \"CIG(E) LLP\" which is based in Europe. This could indicate that Citadel has a global reach and operations in multiple countries. Furthermore, it seems that some of the entities are operating in different business sectors, such as \"CITADEL ENERGY INVESTMENTS LTD\" and \"CITADEL MEDIA LLC\".\n\n/u/CruxHub: That's great, Alice. Those are all valuable insights. Is there anything else that stands out to you?\n\nAlice: There are a few other things I've found, such as Charaxes Melvin LLC and Charaxes Melvin II LLC, which are connected to each other and are named after a type of butterfly. This seems to be an interesting naming choice for a financial entity and it could be worth looking into further. Additionally, some entities have links to regulatory bodies such as the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) which indicate that they are regulated and supervised by these organizations.\n\n/u/CruxHub: That's very thorough, Alice. Thanks for your analysis. These insights will definitely help us in our research on Citadel."

It is characterized by a lack of reliance on coursebooks, a focus on conversational activities, and an emphasis on the spontaneous language produced by the learners. The aim of Dogme is to create an engaging and meaningful learning experience for the students by tapping into their personal experiences and motivations.\n\nThe lexical approach, on the other hand, is a teaching methodology that focuses on vocabulary acquisition as the primary means of acquiring a foreign language. The lexical approach emphasizes the importance of acquiring a large vocabulary in the target language in order to be able to communicate effectively. It argues that grammar rules and structures follow naturally from exposure to words in context. The lexical approach is based on the idea that meaning is central to language, and that vocabulary should therefore be taught in meaningful chunks or \"lexical phrases.\"\n\nIn summary, the Dogme approach emphasizes the learner's spontaneous language and personal experiences, while the lexical approach emphasizes vocabulary acquisition as the key to language learning."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Implementing a netfilter in Linux using Rust requires a deep understanding of both the Linux kernel and Rust programming language. Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. Install Rust: To get started, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official website: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.\n2. Set up your development environment: You will need to install the Linux kernel headers on your development machine. You can install the headers for your current kernel using the following command:\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n```\n1. Create a new Rust project: Once you have Rust and the kernel headers installed, you can create a new Rust project using the `cargo new` command. For example:\n```sh\ncargo new my_netfilter --bin\n```\n1. Write your code: You will need to write the actual code that implements your netfilter. Rust provides a set of FFI bindings to the Linux kernel, which you can use to interface with the kernel. You will need to use these bindings to register your netfilter hook function with the kernel's netfilter framework. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to register a netfilter hook function using Rust:\n```rust\nuse libc::{c_int, c_uint};\nuse std::ffi::CString;\nuse std::os::raw::c_char;\nuse std::ptr;\n\n// Define the netfilter hook function\nextern \"C\" fn my_netfilter_hook(\n    skb: *mut c_void,\n    nf_hook_state: *mut nf_hook_state_t\n) -> c_uint {\n    // Your netfilter hook code goes here\n    // ...\n\n    // Accept the packet\n    NF_ACCEPT\n}\n\n// Register the netfilter hook function\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn init_module() -> c_int {\n    let hook_ops = nf_hook_ops {\n        hook: Some(my_netfilter_hook),\n        hooknum: NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING as u_int8_t,\n        pf: PF_INET as u_int16_t,\n        priority: NF_IP_PRI_FIRST,\n    };\n    let result = unsafe {\n        nf_register_hook(&hook_ops)\n    };\n    if result < 0 {\n        return result as c_int;\n    }\n    0\n}\n\n// Unregister the netfilter hook function\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn cleanup_module() -> c_void {\n    unsafe {\n        nf_unregister_hook(&hook_ops);\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Build your kernel module: Once you have written your code, you can use the `cargo build` command to build your kernel module. This will produce a `.ko` file that you can load into the kernel using the `insmod` command.\n2. Load your kernel module: To load your kernel module, use the `insmod` command. For example:\n```sh\nsudo insmod my_netfilter.ko\n```\n1. Test your netfilter: Once your module is loaded, you can test your netfilter by sending packets through the network interface that your netfilter is hooked to. You can use tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to monitor the packets and verify that your netfilter is working correctly.\n\nNote: Writing kernel modules can be dangerous and may potentially harm your system. Be careful while writing and testing your code."

Environmental Impact: One of the major negative impacts of farming meat is its impact on the environment. The production of meat requires large amounts of water, feed, and land, which can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. Additionally, the methane gas produced by livestock contributes to climate change.\n2. Animal Welfare: Another negative aspect of farming meat is the treatment of animals. Factory farming methods can involve the use of cramped and unsanitary conditions, which can lead to disease and stress among animals. Animals are also often subjected to painful procedures such as castration and dehorning without pain relief.\n3. Health Concerns: The consumption of meat has been linked to various health concerns, including an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, the use of antibiotics in farming can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can make it difficult to treat infections in humans.\n4. Resource Intensive: Meat farming is a resource-intensive process that requires large amounts of energy, water, and land. This can lead to a strain on resources, particularly in areas where there is already limited access to these resources.\n5. Cost: Finally, meat farming can be costly, particularly for small-scale farmers. The cost of feed, veterinary care, and equipment can be high, and many farmers struggle to make a profit. Additionally, the cost of meat can be prohibitive for many consumers, particularly in low-income communities."

Many smartphone cameras also have a grayscale or black and white filter option that you can use to convert an image to monochrome.\n\nGrayscale filters can be used to create a dramatic or vintage look in an image, or to emphasize texture and form in a photograph.

Because when you create a great day today you welcome in a more powerful tomorrow.\n\nWe all have the same 24 hours each day. But why are some people building fabulous careers, achieving healthy lifestyles, enjoying great relationships and incomes, living their passions, and creating what they truly desire as a life?\n\nImagine that you could clear away the distractions that you unconsciously create. You know the stuff that consumes your time causes stress and disconnects you from your purpose and passion. \n\nImagine every day you embrace the energy for what you are choosing to create in your life. Your thoughts empower you, your choices inspire you and your actions create momentum, opportunity and possibility.\n\nYou can create a GREAT LIFE, the life you want to live by focusing your efforts on Creating a Great Day Today. That’s Day Sculpting. Seven intentional sculpted days turn into a month of wonderful weeks and a year of magnificent months creating an amazingly successful life.\n\nNone of this is going to work though if you believe that what you were born with is all you will get…\n\nNo one will ever attempt to do something when they are convinced that they will fail.\n\nResearch has shown that the brain will actually stop itself from doing what’s necessary to succeed if a person believes that they cannot succeed.\n\nIt’s the small concrete indicators of success today that will prove you can have whatever it is you want and the process of Day Sculpting will empowers, inspire and motivates you each step of the way.\n\nYou see: Confidence + Discipline = Desired Outcomes \n\nIt’s time to stop looking at your life from a fear based I don’t know how to mindset but rather be open to creating a solutions focused change consciousness that embraces your gift and talents and encourages you sharing them.\n\nLet me share a bit of nuero-chemistry with you…\nWhat fires together wires together…\n\nSo rather than Fall back on old habits…\nTake the transitional step…of being fully present to whats trying emerge as your ideal future and to help it along start building confidence each day…\n\nAnd your possibility muscle and an intended thought process that leads to a more focused and clear out picturing of your desires.\n\nYou see...It’s one thing to set goals and to make to do lists and to say your going to use the law of attraction to manifest what you want in life…\n\nI’m still looking at the many lists I have created.\n\nWhat it’s really about is having a clear and purposeful intention in order to create the energy and the MindState Of success that will propel you into action.\n----\n\nWhen done ask me for part 2"

        "value": "Here is the final part. Part 3\n---\n\nHere we will be showing how the principles and practices we’ve covered so far converge into one over-arching result that will benefit you for the rest of your life. You can think of it as flipping a switch that changes how you create new results in life one day at a time. This is at the very core of what we call Day Sculpting. \nThe simplest way to think of it is that most of the way we live is habitual. You have an habitual way of brushing your teeth, walking, talking to yourself and others, eating, working. Habits are wonderful…they make life easy but they also limit you. For example, if you have a habit of eating too much, you’ll put on weight. Not instantly, but steadily, day by day, until one day you have a weight problem. If you try to change your weight quickly through a trendy new diet, research shows that the weight is likely to come back, and then some, within a few short months, because the habits required to live at your ideal weight have not been properly established. \nHabits are habits because you don’t think about them, they happen nonconsciously. If you want a change in your life, you have to embody the change at a nonconscious level, so that the habits keeping your life the way it is today begin to shift.\nWouldn’t it be great if there was a switch in the brain that would move you from status quo to status GO!? This is a switch that once you flip it will produce the result you want, if you are willing to commit to and stay with the process.Day Sculpting is your guide to fully realizing the success you are ready to enjoy.\nA critically important capacity of the human mind called preconscious processing. This is the ability of the mind to receive information, beneath our conscious awareness, and act upon it without even knowing that it is happening. Used correctly, this is an amazing power. Used improperly, it will sabotage your best efforts and make life extremely difficult.\nMost of us think we are running the show with our conscious awareness, consciously choosing our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and consequently, we believe are able to choose the results we create in life. However, what neuro-science research shows, is that we all have a vast nonconscious mind that is really running the show most of the time. That deeper part of us, in charge of our habitual thinking, feeling, and behaving is always operating in our best interest. But it does so using information that may be faulty or outdated. If you continue to feed it information that doesn’t serve you, it will continue to habitually bring results that are less than desired.\nYour preconscious processor is constantly routing new information directly into this larger database that your mind uses to create new behaviors. Your job is to place the right information into this database every single day, so that it can draw upon this new data and create new results. It requires your vigilance and purposeful intention on a daily basis. Day Sculpting is the process to accomplish exactly that, getting you to focus one day at a time on what you are trying to create in your life today, and the future you truly desire. \nA lot of experts in the human development field teach information and then expect it will translate into new behaviors automatically. But as we’ve pointed out, and as you’ve probably experienced, consciously knowing something and having the nonconscious mind put it into a new behavior, are two entirely different processes. What we are sharing with you is how to bridge that gap. This is precisely why so many experts in the field are recommending Day Sculpting to their clients, to help them use momentum mindsets on a daily basis and apply the good information they teach. \nWe talk about The The Solutions Focus process . Try it out: \nThink of an area of your life in which you are actively attempting to create different results. Imagine your chief aim regarding this area of your life as a perfect future. Now imagine a scale from one to ten, where ten is the perfect future and one is that you have not even started thinking about your chief aim. On this imaginary scale from 1 to 10, where would you place yourself right now?\nGo ahead and imagine where would you place yourself right now on that scale, where ten is your perfect future.\nWhatever number you came up with is fine. Whether it was 3 or 7, whatever you came up with I’ll always ask the same next question. “Why so high and not lower?”\nLet’s say, for example that you came up with a three. Asking the question “Why so High” catches the mind off guard. Most people expect, “Only a 3! Why so low?” If I had asked that what would you come up with? All the reasons why things aren’t working, who is to blame, problems, excuses, lack, limitations, and so on. \nBut when I ask “Why so high?” the brain immediately begins to sort for all of the things that are working for you, everything that has brought you up to a “three.” If you said you are at a seven on a scale of one to ten, the same question applies: “Why so high and not lower?”\nThe next step in solutions focus is equally powerful. “Think about what you can do today to move you one point up that scale—for example, from a three to a four, or from a seven to an eight?” When you ask this, your mind instantaneously starts generating ideas and options to answer your question. You quickly realize you can do more of the things that work, right? And if you are doing things that aren’t working, you now have the insight into how you can do things differently. \nThis solutions focus approach provides quick insight into how to move things forward in areas you may have been stuck or working on unsuccessfully. It is a brilliant way to access more of your nonconscious database and facilitate discovering resources you did not know were there. \nSo as you can see, this video has been centered on connecting the dots and providing you with the insights on how you can flip the switch in your brain and how you can create your life one day at a time in the most powerful way possible. \nYou must contact that inner part of you that is in charge of your habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving in order to re-sculpt yourself.\nThis is a unique psychological principle called anchoring. In the research this is also called behavioral conditioning, and as we’ve called it, the law of reinforcement…which says you get more of what you reinforce. When you want to reinforce a positive new behavior, you anchor it in a positive new momentum mindset. As you do this on a daily basis, you are literally training your mind, conditioning your thoughts, amplifying positive feelings and emotions to live into a future state that you are anchoring in your daily experience. \nDay Sculpting goes beyond personal development. It takes whatever it is you are currently learning and makes it possible for you to embody, apply and enjoy the benefits you are committed to achieve. \n\nThe last thing anyone needs is more stuff to do. What we need is that everything we do gets us the results we are going for. In essence what’s needed is a system that will streamline our efforts so we accomplish our chief aims in less time.\n\nMichaelangelo said the process of sculpting is to remove what’s not supposed to be there. He had the mindset that the finished sculpture already existed in the marble and he just had to reveal it. In the same way your destiny already resides in you. You just need to clear a path for it to emerge.\n\nWe all have 24 hours in a day. So why do some people consistently have great days while others are up and down and stay stuck in mediocrity? It’s a disciplined habit of how you approach everyday. Day Sculpting takes the same 24 hours that we all have and helps clarify your choices so that your actions reveal your highest destiny. \n\nIt is a quick, easy and effortless way that supports and empowers your efforts in achieving your chief aims. It creates the mindsets necessary to have successful days, weeks, months and years.\n\nDay Sculpting is a 90- day program designed to empower you to create your life ONE DAY AT A TIME. By committing 30 minutes each day to create what you want that day. \n\nWe believe that when you focus your actions one day at a time the results you get become measurable and achievable. Your energy is committed to channeling your efforts so you create a confident groove in your mind that empowers your habitual actions to create what you really want.\n\nThis daily program is broken down into 3 MANAGEABLE, SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS. 15 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes midday and 10 minutes at night. \n\nDay Sculpting…It’s designed so that the way you start your day creates the momentum that carries you throughout your day. \n\nAnd finally research has shown that the best time to integrate what you’ve learned in your day and to set yourself up for success tomorrow is before you go to sleep. The Nighttime Review process takes just 10 minutes, which is less time then it takes to take a shower or to take your dog on an evening walk.\n\nWe already have enough complexity in life…don’t we? We don’t want you working harder we want you thinking smarter! So that the success you achieve is more effortless. \n\nSo what does it take for someone to accomplish the high level results we are talking about?\n\n• First you have to wake up and be totally jazzed about the day\n• You have to be inspired to do your best\n• You have to be focused on creating what you truly desire\n• You got to get to it, stay on it, and be in the energy of it before your distractions take over. \n• And if distractions takeover you have to quickly get back on track.\n• You have to learn from what’s working and what’s not\n• You have to be able to listen to feedback and course correct during your day\n• And at the end of the day you have be able to feel you did your best and you can do even better tomorrow\n\nAnd with Day Sculpting you can accomplish this and more in less than 30 minutes which is distributed throughout your day. Most people will give up on their dreams after they have tried something only 3 times because they didn’t get instant gratification. \n\nThere are no magic bullets here. You are investing in a future YOU desire. \n\nDay Sculpting gives you the opportunity everyday to purposefully stay in the energy of what you want to create the benefit to you being a more empowered mindset that inspires passionate action and a willingness to breakthrough any barriers that may have held you back in the past so you fully embody the life you choose to live.\n\nYou may have heard Gandhi say “Be the change you want to see in the world.” Well now you can. \n\nYears ago I heard a statistic that blew me away. If you read in a single subject of your choice for 15 minutes a day 5 days a week you would become one of the leading experts in the world in that subject within 3 years…\n\nMore recent research has demonstrated that world class talent requires 10000 hours and 10 years to develop…\n\nSo the question is how does somebody create this kind of commitment and persistence? Clearly one day at a time.\n\nSo where are you not following through in your life? How would you like to do things differently? What can you do shift your energy when you say I can’t get it done or you procrastinate? What’s it going to take for you to say I’ve had enough it’s time for me to do something different? Where will you get the support you need to build the confidence to stay on track?\n\nEach day you get these elements to help guide you… \n- The Good Morning Great Day Email\n- The Morning In Vision Video \n- The Morning Future Pacing Visualization\n- The Morning Success Journal Process\n- The Midday SMS and Computer Stay on Track Reminders\n- The Midday Reconnect Refresher Mediation\n- The Evening Review And Renew Process\n- The Evening Journal Process\n- The Bedtime Nonconcious Mind Question Declaration\n \nWhen you put this together it can’t help but become a daily practice that will create your new daily ritual that is your roadmap to success. We are giving you the daily steps that will create your momentum mindsets.\n\nThe Day Sculpting program leaves you no wiggle room. The days of “I’ll get to it later” are gone. When you are serious about changing your life, you now have a realistic opportunity to do so with this program. \n\nWE invite you to fully commit to your life. To once and for all follow through and step up. To say yes to that dream inside of you and to look at each day as an opportunity to live your dreams enthusiastically rather than settling for more of the same old same old.\n---"

Based on the web search results you provided, it seems that there are a few different ways you could approach building a Google Places autocomplete feature using Jetpack Compose and the MVVM model.\n\nOne option would be to create a custom composable using a DropDownMenu and BaseTextField, as suggested in one of the Stack Overflow responses [[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64419367/does-jetpack-compose-offer-a-material-autocomplete-textview-replacement)]. This approach would involve creating a ViewModel to hold the list of suggested places based on the user's input, and then passing that list to the custom composable to display in the DropDownMenu.\n\nAnother option would be to use a hybrid approach that combines XML-autocomplete and Compose screens through the ComposeView, as suggested in another Stack Overflow response [[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64419367/does-jetpack-compose-offer-a-material-autocomplete-textview-replacement)]. This approach would involve creating an XML layout with a Material AutoCompleteTextView, and then using the ComposeView to inflate that layout and wrap it in a Compose Column to display the selected place in a LazyColumn.\n\nFinally, there is a tutorial available on the Google Codelabs website that walks through building adaptive apps with Jetpack Compose, including how to use Compose to enhance reachability and build responsive UIs on different device types [[1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/jetpack-compose-adaptability)]. While this tutorial doesn't specifically cover Google Places autocomplete, it may still be a useful resource for learning more about building Compose apps in general.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

        "value": "Paper Name: My Tweets Bring All the Traits to the Yard: Predicting Personality and Relational Traits in Online Social Networks\n\nAbstract: Users in Online Social Networks (OSNs,) leave traces that reflect their personality characteristics. The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples’ psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\n\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\n\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\n\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users’ psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals’ social profile.\n\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one’s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users—humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people’s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\n\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users’ psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people’s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\n\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\n\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users’ holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\n\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology and a holistic profiling approach.\n\nPsychological profiling in the wild. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed psychological profiling methodology through a use case. We identify a set of Twitter users who seem to be accepted as opinion leaders on social media (i.e., have a large following). We apply our methodology to predict their psychological profiles and analyze results. We find that the distributions of traits significantly deviates from regular users (defined as users included in our ground-truth dataset), and that the set of leaders can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles. These findings highlight the usefulness of our approach in the characterization of the personalities for different groups of OSN users (e.g., such a group psychological profile could be used to recommend skills/activities/jobs to users based on their profile similarity) and classification of users based on their profiles.\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of related psychological literature, discuss related work, and highlight several open issues of existing methods. We also highlight the contribution of the present work. Section 3 details the collected dataset and the data mining and feature engineering methodology, and Section 4 presents the design and evaluation of the proposed machine learning predictive model. Finally, we conclude our article and discuss future work in Section 6.\n\nFirst, Please Summarize the paper in 10 points, in easy to read and understand simple English.\nSecond, Explain what the paper does as if I'm 11 years old.\n\nThanks :))"

The approach has potential applications in areas like customer segmentation, digital advertising, and community formation.\n\nExplaining to an 11-year-old:\nThis paper is about studying how people act and feel on social media websites like Twitter. It looks at the different ways people behave and talk to each other, and how that can tell us about their personality. There are different types of personality traits, and this study tries to find out both the traits that are about the individual and how they relate to others.\n\nThe researchers created a computer program that can look at what people post on Twitter and learn about their personality traits. They tested their program on two groups of people: regular users and famous people who have lots of followers. The program was able to tell the difference between these two groups by looking at their personality traits. This could help us better understand people on social media and find new ways to use this information in the future."

        "value": "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company’s or agency’s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n• Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n• Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO’s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n• Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn’t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors’ Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n• Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company’s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public’s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can “snow” the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it’s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as “a reliable source.” Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: “Acme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.”\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: “Acme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, ‘Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors’ in endurance, quality, and safety; it’s also available at a lower\nprice.’ ”\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n“In repeated tests against our competitors . . . ”\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you’ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who’s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there’s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance—press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies—that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don’t know, say, “I don’t\nhave that information at the moment, but I’ll get it to you as soon as I do”—\nthen follow up.\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you’re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\nwill always want to get to the top. They’ll be more likely to cover\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\ng. Don’t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\nsmelling anxiety.\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point. Rambling and repetition\nare likely to get you into trouble or open new lines of inquiry.\ni. If you’re facing a problem you’ve caused, however inadvertently, be prepared\nto acknowledge\n\nAre you ready for text 3?"

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of very small particles, such as atoms and subatomic particles.\n\nIn a classical computer, information is processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits, or qubits, to store and process information. Qubits can represent both a 0 and a 1 simultaneously, a property known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nQuantum computers also have another quantum mechanical property called entanglement, which allows them to perform certain operations in parallel. This means that they can perform many calculations at the same time, further increasing their speed and power.\n\nQuantum computing is still a relatively new field and is not yet widely used. However, it has the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and industry, including cryptography, drug discovery, and machine learning."

It is a natural geological process that involves the erosion and transportation of sediment, which is then deposited in a new location, often forming layers of sedimentary rock over time.\n\nDeposition can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gravity, wind, water, or ice. For example, sediment can be carried by a river and deposited at the river's mouth, forming a delta. Similarly, wind can transport sand and dust particles, which can settle on surfaces as dunes or dust deposits. Glaciers can also transport and deposit rocks and soil as they move.\n\nIn addition to geological processes, deposition can also occur in industrial and technological contexts. For example, in semiconductor manufacturing, deposition refers to the process of depositing thin films of material onto a substrate using techniques such as chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.\n\nOverall, deposition is an important natural and industrial process that helps shape our world and can have significant impacts on the environment and technological progress."

These three directions are called dimensions.\n\nBut there's something really cool called the fourth dimension, which is like another direction that we can't see or touch. This direction is called time, and it helps us understand how things move and change over time.\n\nFor example, imagine a movie that you like. The movie has characters, places, and things that move and change over time. When we watch the movie, we see everything happening one after the other, like a story. That's because time is the fourth dimension that helps us understand how everything in the movie is connected and changing.\n\nSo, the fourth dimension is like a special way to think about how things change over time. We can't see it or touch it like we do with the other three dimensions, but it's really important for us to understand how our world works!"

        "value": "The French Revolution, which lasted from 1789 to 1799, was one of the most significant events in modern history. It was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that had far-reaching consequences, not only for the country but for Europe and the world as a whole. This essay will explore the causes, key events, and outcomes of the French Revolution.\n\nCauses of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution was a response to the economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades. One of the main causes of the revolution was the country's deepening financial crisis. The French government was heavily in debt due to the cost of the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution, and the burden of this debt fell on the common people in the form of heavy taxes.\n\nAnother significant cause of the French Revolution was the country's outdated feudal system. The nobility and clergy held vast amounts of power and wealth, while the majority of the population, the peasants and middle class, were oppressed and excluded from political decision-making.\n\nKey Events of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase, which lasted from 1789 to 1792, was marked by the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nThe second phase, which lasted from 1792 to 1794, was characterized by the rise of the radical Jacobin faction, led by Maximilien Robespierre. During this phase, the king, Louis XVI, was executed, and a Reign of Terror ensued, during which thousands of people were executed for perceived counter-revolutionary activities.\n\nThe third phase, which lasted from 1794 to 1799, saw the fall of Robespierre and the rise of the Directory, a five-man governing body. During this phase, the French armies expanded their control over Europe, but the country continued to experience political instability and economic problems.\n\nOutcomes of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution had a profound impact on France and the world. In France, the Revolution brought an end to the monarchy and the feudal system, established the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and created a modern, secular state.\n\nThe Revolution also had far-reaching effects on Europe and the world. It inspired similar revolutions in other countries, such as the Haitian Revolution, and helped to spread democratic ideas and values across the globe.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event that had profound consequences for France and the world. It was a response to economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades and was marked by key events such as the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, the execution of Louis XVI, and the Reign of Terror.\n\nThe Revolution's outcomes included the establishment of a modern, secular state in France and the spread of democratic ideas and values across the globe. Despite the challenges and controversies of the Revolution, it remains an important chapter in the history of the modern world."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "That's correct! To control 12V solenoids with the Raspberry Pi, you will need to use relay modules that are compatible with the Pi's GPIO pins.\n\nRelay modules allow you to use a low-voltage signal (in this case, from the Pi's GPIO pins) to control a high-voltage circuit (the 12V solenoids). The relay acts like a switch that is controlled by the Pi's GPIO pins. When the GPIO pin is set to HIGH, the relay is closed and the solenoid is turned on, and when the GPIO pin is set to LOW, the relay is opened and the solenoid is turned off.\n\nHere's an example of how to connect a relay module to the Raspberry Pi and control a solenoid:\n\n1. Connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The exact wiring will depend on the specific relay module you are using, so be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. In general, you will need to connect the relay module's VCC and GND pins to the Pi's 5V and GND pins, and connect the relay module's IN pin to a GPIO pin on the Pi.\n2. Connect the solenoid to the relay module. Again, the exact wiring will depend on the specific components you are using. Typically, you will connect one end of the solenoid to the relay module's NO (Normally Open) pin and the other end to the relay module's COM (Common) pin. When the relay is closed, the circuit is completed and the solenoid is turned on.\n3. Write a Python program that uses the RPi.GPIO library to control the GPIO pins and turn the solenoids on and off through the relay modules. The exact code will depend on your specific setup and timed sequence requirements, but here's an example of how to turn a single solenoid on and off:\n```python\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\nimport time\n\n# Set up GPIO pins\nGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)\nGPIO.setup(relay_pin, GPIO.OUT)\n\n# Turn solenoid on\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.HIGH)\ntime.sleep(on_time)\n\n# Turn solenoid off\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.LOW)\ntime.sleep(off_time)\n\n# Clean up GPIO pins\nGPIO.cleanup()\n```\n4. Modify the Python program to control multiple solenoids in a timed sequence. You can use the same basic logic as the example above, but you will need to add additional relay modules and GPIO pins for each solenoid.\n5. Add a feature to the GUI that allows you to set the time for each solenoid in the sequence.\n6. Test the entire system to ensure that the timed sequence and relay control are working correctly. Make sure to test the system under a variety of operating conditions to ensure reliability.\n\nWith these additional steps, you will have a control module that can control 12V solenoids using relay modules that are triggered by the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins."

My name is Ayaam Ghimire, and I am writing to you on behalf of CompuCycle, an organization dedicated to electronic waste management and computer donations. We are reaching out to request your assistance in setting up e-waste boxes around the Guilford College campus and establishing a computer donation program with Bauman IT or any other facility on the campus.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Kash, the principal at Guilford College, and he expressed interest in working with CompuCycle to promote sustainable e-waste disposal and computer donations on the campus. With your help as the liaison between ECG and Guilford College, we believe we can make a positive impact on the environment and the community.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with e-waste boxes that we could place around campus for students and staff to deposit their electronic waste. We would also like to discuss the possibility of setting up a computer donation program where we could collect used computers, refurbish them, and donate them to individuals or organizations in need.\n\nIf you could let us know what steps we need to take to move forward with this initiative, that would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to working with you to make Guilford College a more sustainable and socially responsible community.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAyaam Ghimire."

They may have anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred employees and may be privately or publicly owned.\n\nLarge corporation: These are very large, well-established companies that typically have thousands of employees and a significant amount of resources. They may be publicly traded on a stock exchange and may have operations in multiple countries.\n\nFortune 500 company: These are the largest and most successful companies in the world, as ranked by Fortune magazine. To be included on the Fortune 500 list, a company must have annual revenues of at least $5 billion. These companies are typically household names and have a significant impact on the global economy.\n\nI hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

        "value": "The importance of higher education cannot be overstated in today's society. While a high school diploma used to be sufficient for many jobs, the reality is that employers are now seeking candidates with advanced degrees and specialized skills. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why higher education is necessary for success in today's economy.\n\nFirstly, higher education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in today's job market. Many professions require advanced degrees, such as law, medicine, and engineering. Even in fields where a degree is not required, having one can give job seekers an edge over the competition. In addition to providing specialized knowledge, higher education also teaches critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are highly valued by employers.\n\nSecondly, higher education is essential for personal growth and development. College and university campuses provide students with opportunities to explore their interests, develop new skills, and form lifelong connections with peers and mentors. Students are exposed to a diverse range of ideas, cultures, and perspectives, which can broaden their understanding of the world and help them become more empathetic and open-minded individuals.\n\nFinally, higher education is critical for economic growth and development. In today's knowledge-based economy, innovation and technological advancements are the key drivers of growth. Higher education institutions are hubs for research and development, and they play a critical role in fostering innovation and driving economic progress. By investing in higher education, governments can create a highly skilled workforce and attract businesses and industries that require specialized talent.\n\nIn conclusion, higher education is essential for success in today's society. It provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and connections necessary to compete in the job market and contribute to economic growth and development. While the cost of higher education can be a barrier for many, there are options available, such as scholarships, grants, and student loans, to help make it more accessible. As a society, we must continue to invest in higher education to ensure that we remain competitive and continue to drive progress in the years to come."

Additionally, measuring changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, and other molecular markers can provide insight into the underlying cellular and molecular processes that support learning."

        "value": "To make a software like Obsidian with Python, you will need to have a strong understanding of both Python and software development in general. Obsidian is a powerful tool for creating and managing knowledge, and making a similar software with Python would require a significant amount of work.\n\nHere are the basic steps you would need to take to make a software like Obsidian with Python:\n\n1. First, you would need to decide on the specific features and functionality that you want your software to have. Obsidian is a very feature-rich tool, so you may want to focus on creating a simpler version of the software that includes only the most essential features.\n2. Once you have a clear idea of what your software will do, you will need to start designing the user interface. This will involve creating wireframes and mockups of the various screens and features of your software, to help you visualize how it will look and work.\n3. Next, you will need to start writing the code for your software. This will involve using Python to create the various components of your software, including the user interface, the data storage and management systems, and any other features or functionality that you have planned.\n4. As you work on the code for your software, you will also need to test it regularly to ensure that it is working as intended. This will involve using various testing tools and techniques to verify that the different components of your software are functioning properly.\n5. Once your software is complete and has been thoroughly tested, you will need to package it and distribute it to users. This may involve creating an installer program, publishing the software on online platforms, or providing it as a download from your own website.\n\nOverall, creating a software like Obsidian with Python will require a significant amount of time, effort, and expertise. It is not a task that can be completed quickly or easily, but with dedication and hard work, it is certainly possible."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Sure, here's one possible approach to building a two-way sign language translator app:\n\n1. Collect sign language data: The first step would be to collect a large dataset of sign language videos or animations for different words, phrases, and sentences. You can either create these videos/animations yourself or use existing ones.\n2. Train a sign language recognition model: Once you have a dataset, you can train a machine learning model to recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text or speech. There are various approaches to this, such as using computer vision techniques to analyze hand movements or using sensors to capture data from gloves worn by sign language users.\n3. Train a speech recognition model: Similarly, you can train a machine learning model to recognize speech and convert it into text. There are many existing speech recognition APIs and libraries you can use for this step.\n4. Integrate the two models: Once you have trained both models, you can integrate them into a single app that can recognize both sign language and speech inputs and translate them accordingly. You'll need to design an intuitive user interface that allows users to switch between the two modes easily.\n5. Test and refine: Finally, you'll need to test the app with actual sign language users and speech users to see how well it performs and make adjustments as needed. You may also want to consider adding additional features, such as a dictionary of common sign language phrases or the ability to save frequently used phrases for easier access.\n\nOverall, building a two-way sign language translator app is a complex task that requires expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and app development. However, with the right approach and resources, it is definitely possible to create an effective and useful tool for sign language communication."

Group Policy: If the group policy settings on the secondary servers do not allow remote management, then the secondary admin accounts may not be able to manage those servers. Check the group policy settings on the secondary servers to see if they are configured to allow remote management.\n3. Firewall: Make sure that the firewall on the secondary servers is configured to allow remote management. If the firewall is blocking the traffic required for remote management, then the secondary admin accounts will not be able to connect to the secondary servers.\n4. Remote Management Configuration: Check if Remote Management is configured on the targeted secondary servers. It may be disabled by default, so you need to enable it.\n5. RSAT Version: Check the version of RSAT client you are using to connect to the servers and if it is compatible with the target servers OS version.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities, and there could be other reasons for the issue you're experiencing. I recommend checking the event logs on the domain controller and the secondary servers to see if there are any error messages related to the issue. This will give you more information to help troubleshoot the problem."

It is located on several islands and surrounded by fjords, which means that there are plenty of opportunities for scenic hikes and boat trips.\n\nAlthough Ålesund is a popular destination for Norwegians, it is not as well-known among tourists as some of the larger cities in Norway, such as Oslo and Bergen. This means that you are likely to find fewer tourists, especially if you avoid visiting during the high season (June-August).\n\nIn addition to its stunning architecture and natural beauty, Ålesund has a rich cultural scene, with a variety of museums, galleries, and festivals. For example, you can visit the Jugendstilsenteret museum to learn more about the art nouveau style, or attend the Ålesund Theatre Festival to see performances by local and international artists.\n\nOverall, Ålesund is a great choice if you are looking for a medium-sized city with character, natural beauty, and few tourists."

In this case, x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0. Factoring, we get (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0. Therefore, x = 3 is a root of the denominator, and x = 3 is a vertical asymptote.\n\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we need to consider the degree of the numerator and denominator of the function and what their ratio is, when degree of the numerator is less than degree of the denominator, the function has a horizontal asymptote and it's the ratio of leading coefficients. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 1 and the denominator has a degree of 2, and the ratio of the leading coefficients is 3/x, which approaches 0 as x gets large, which means y = 0 is horizontal asymptote.\n\nFor the x-intercept, it is when y=0, so we can set the numerator to zero: 3x-9 = 0, x = 3 is x-intercept.\n\nFor the y-intercept, it is when x=0, so plugging x = 0 into the function we get -9/12 which is -3/4 is y-intercept."

You might have heard the fanboys singing its praises, but let me tell you why this game is a steaming pile of dogshit that you should avoid like the plague.\n\nFirst off, this overhyped bastard child of a game has been in development since the fucking Mesozoic era, or at least it feels like it. The devs have been promising updates, new features, and bug fixes for what seems like eons, but we're still stuck with the same goddamn issues year after year. It's like trying to fix a piece of burnt toast – you can scrape off the charred surface, but it's never going to taste good again.\n\nSecondly, the learning curve in this game is more of a fucking cliff. New players are thrown into the meat grinder with no lube or guidance, left to fend for themselves in a cruel, punishing world. You'll spend countless hours being repeatedly curb-stomped by veterans who have been playing this shitfest since the beginning. Unless you have a masochistic streak or the patience of a saint, you're going to be left feeling like a chump who wasted their hard-earned money.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the godawful inventory system. Managing your loot in this game is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture while blindfolded and hammered. It's a convoluted clusterfuck that could only have been designed by someone with a deep, abiding hatred for usability and player satisfaction.\n\nThe performance in Escape from Tarkov is also a fucking joke. Even with a top-of-the-line gaming rig, you'll experience more stutters than a nervous teenager at a spelling bee. The game's optimization is about as effective as trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol. You'd think that with all the time and resources spent on development, they'd at least make sure it runs smoothly, but nope – it's a stuttery, laggy mess.\n\nFinally, the community in this game can be downright toxic. Sure, there are some decent folks out there, but too many players take delight in making your life a living hell. They'll camp your corpse, talk shit, and make you feel like the lowest form of scum for daring to have a life outside of Tarkov.\n\nIn conclusion, Escape from Tarkov is a steaming pile of dogshit that you should avoid like the fucking plague. If you're looking for a game that respects your time, sanity, and hard drive space, look elsewhere. There's a whole world of better games out there, so don't waste your time on this dumpster fire."

Many of the company’s experiments have spawned profitable new businesses—think Marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Prime. Others, however, fared less well and were shut down quickly: Crucible, the company’s foray into multiplayer gaming; Haven, its health care joint venture with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway; and Spark, Amazon’s attempt to build an Instagram-like shopping platform. But even the failures provided important lessons that helped Bezos and his team make future investments more successful. Its test-and-learn culture has made Amazon one of the most innovative and valuable companies in the world.\n\nLeaders should set concrete guidelines for where they choose to experiment, because running many small experiments can quickly degenerate into placing many small bets—a losing strategy, as we’ve noted. At Amazon, for example, experimentation is confined to testing “dreamy” ideas—ideas that customers love, that could become very large businesses, that could generate very strong returns, and that have a decent chance of enduring.\n\nMarketplace, AWS, and Prime all met those guidelines. Take Prime: No one on the Amazon team could point to data showing that giving customers free shipping for a yearly subscription fee would ever pay for itself. Through experimentation, first in select local markets and then globally, Amazon was able to validate the idea and build Prime into a $25 billion business by 2020, 15 years after it launched. In summary, small experiments are perfectly fine (in fact, encouraged), but each experiment should be tied to something very big to ensure that the test is worth running. Correctly applied, experiments prove the viability of big bets."

The authors suggest that leaders should set guidelines for experimentation, such as confining it to testing \"dreamy\" ideas that have a good chance of success. They also suggest that experiments should be tied to something very big, so that they are worth running. By running experiments before making large investments, companies can avoid making risky bets and can validate the viability of their strategic moves."

The leadership team meets, typically quarterly, to review each unit’s performance against plan and identify variances. In some cases leaders push for better performance; in others they simply revise the plan to accommodate the variances. In such situations performance reviews provide little if any useful surveillance regarding likely future conditions or helpful guidance as to whether the company should consider changing direction.\n\nTo become more adaptable to changing conditions, leaders must approach performance monitoring with a new mindset. The central question cannot be “How did we perform?” Instead it must be “Should we alter course?”\n\nAnswering that question requires more and different information than does the standard weather report. Leaders must understand the root causes of any performance shortfall. And they must have prepared contingency plans that can be put into motion speedily to address any significant changes in market or competitive conditions. A few leading companies have created thresholds for grading signposts green, yellow, or red. When a signpost crosses a critical threshold, it signals a change in direction (red) or a need for deeper investigation (yellow).\n\nTetra Pak, an €11 billion food-packaging and -processing company headquartered in Switzerland and Sweden, has this type of performance monitoring in place. In devising the company’s strategy, its leaders considered four scenarios, ranging from go green faster to strong push toward commoditization. The company tracks 42 signposts each quarter, including leading indicators such as the percentage of packaging required by law to be recycled in key geographies, the percentage price increase realized on packs with sustainability features, the percentage share of e-commerce players in the food and beverage segment, and average operating margins of food and beverage retailers.\n\nCEO Adolfo Orive and his team keep quarterly business reviews focused on the future (“What do we need to do?”), not the past (“What were our sales in India last quarter?”). When signposts suggest a move toward one scenario over the others, management takes steps to accelerate its existing programs or launch new ones. That has enabled Tetra Pak to adapt its strategy quickly to fundamental shifts in environmental policy and customer preferences. To take just one of many examples at the company, as price elasticity in its largest markets increased far faster than its base forecast—a flashing-red indicator of commoditization—Tetra Pak accelerated its push toward lower-cost packaging. The new model has also made performance monitoring at the company far more action oriented and consequential, resulting in much higher levels of growth and profitability.\n\nAlthough many promising tools have been developed to help cope with uncertainty, most executives struggle in consistently applying them to make better decisions. Winning in uncertain times requires a new model for strategy development. Companies that move quickly to adopt the more dynamic approach we’ve set out will pull ahead—and stay ahead—in the coming decades. Those that stick with their “plan then do” ways risk falling irreparably behind."

        "value": "David J. Collis goes on to say\nThe Incumbent’s Mistake\nCEOs of established companies often pay too much attention to defining how their firms will capture value and too little to new ways to create value and how firms’ activities and capabilities need to evolve over time. One reason is that approaches focusing on capture (like the five forces) have been very successful in long-established and stable industries and as a result have become ingrained in the strategy process. But CEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking? When did it allow us to become the “disruptive” innovator?\n\nLook at the list of the most valuable companies in the United States, and you’ll see that discovering and exploiting new business models to satisfy previously unmet, unexpressed, or even unknown customer needs is where the action has been in recent years. Those companies didn’t collectively create trillions of dollars in value by outpositioning their rivals. When they were founded, they didn’t have rivals. Indeed, the kind of businesses they started didn’t exist previously.\n\nWinning with a New Business Model. The most valuable companies in America all launched brand new business models that met previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. Here are the five largest U.S companies by market cap, as of April 12, 20 21: One: Apple, founded in 1976, now worth 2 point 2 trillion dollars. Two: Microsoft, founded in 1975, now worth 1 point 9 trillion dollars. Three: Amazon, founded in 1994, now worth 1 point 7 trillion dollars. Four: Alphabet, founded in 1998, now worth 1 point 5 trillion dollars. Five: Facebook, founded in 2004, now worth 880 billion dollars. Source: Yahoo Finance\nThe good news for leaders of incumbent companies is that the emergence of new approaches doesn’t have to doom their enterprises. Indeed, if they take a holistic perspective on strategy, they may discover that those business models present attractive opportunities because they create more value.\n\nFor example, would you rather make a onetime sale of a physical product or build a long-term client relationship and deliver tailored solutions that generate more value for the customer and potentially much more profit for you? As some old-line companies have discovered, the latter is the opportunity that new digital business models offer firms that can effectively leverage data and analytics. Komatsu now offers subscriptions to its Smart Construction platform, which coordinates all the activities of a construction site, including drone surveys, dumptruck scheduling, and the operation of autonomous earthmoving equipment. The platform cuts construction projects’ entire costs by well over 15%—creating far more value than the revenue from the sale of bulldozers, which was all that was available in Komatsu’s previous model. In a somewhat similar fashion, Siemens uses artificial intelligence to predict, and so prevent, maintenance issues on its trains. The improvement in uptime performance allows it to switch to performance-based contracts for rail service that bring in thousands of dollars a day, rather than just the initial price of a train.\n\nNo incumbent should respond to every new business model—that would simply be playing whack-a-mole. Instead, a firm must develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of models and then determine whether to pursue any new ones by predicting the outcome of competition among alternative models.\n\nBy using available tools, strategists could have foreseen, for example, that video on demand (streaming) would replace Netflix’s original mail-order delivery of DVDs and Blockbuster’s old-fashioned video stores. The superiority of the value proposition for the job to be done for the customer, which was “delivering personal video entertainment,” suggests the absolute dominance of streaming. An examination of the purchase criteria you might consider—convenience, the ability to make an impulse purchase, access to recent best sellers, a large back catalog—reveals that video on demand serves customers better than either of the earlier business models. If that weren’t enough, the cost of delivering movies and TV shows over the internet is vastly lower than doing so via physical stores or the mail. Considering those advantages, it’s no wonder that almost everyone is now paying monthly subscription fees to streaming services.\n\nWhy Streaming Video Beat Rival Models. Its value proposition was much stronger than the propositions of video stores and DVD-by-mail on almost every dimension, and its costs were far lower. Streaming video excelled on price, convenience, variety of titles, immediate access, availability of best sellers, functionality on multiple devices, variety of media delivered, and ability to connect to other applications and platforms. DVD-by-mail excelled only on variety of titles. Video stores did not excel on any dimension. The cost of delivering a video to a customer was only 25 cents for streaming in 2007, but 1 dollar and 25 cents for DVD-by-mail and 2 dollars and 24 cents for video stores. Source: Author analysis, “Netflix in 20 11,” an HBS case study by Willy Shih and Stephen P. Kaufman\nIn contrast, a similar analysis suggests that Amazon’s online business model, which consists of a retail website, a limited number of fulfillment centers, and fleets of delivery trucks, will never fully displace Walmart’s longtime business model, which features traditional brick-and-mortar stores supplied by a national network of distribution centers. When you compare how well each does the job to be done, you see that Amazon’s model is good at providing home delivery for a very broad range (hundreds of millions) of items, while Walmart’s is better for immediate availability at low cost of a more limited number (a few hundred thousand). Each business model has a distinctive proposition that appeals to different customers on different occasions for different products. And a comparison of the cost positions of their asset bases shows that Walmart’s logistics system is low cost for everyday items that consumers pick up in stores in rural or suburban locations, while Amazon’s is more efficient for long-tail items and home delivery in densely populated geographies. Neither business model universally dominates the other. Both will survive, which is why each company is rushing to replicate the other’s asset base, with Amazon buying Whole Foods, and Walmart spending billions of dollars to expand online and add fulfillment centers."

Collis adds\nThe Entrepreneur’s Mistake\nIn their excitement to exploit new opportunities they spotted before anyone else, many entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they’re likely to face. Netflix has been copied by dozens of credible companies, including Disney, and Casper—the innovator of the bed-in-a-box business model—has 175 competitors. Seduced by their immediate success, entrepreneurs often commit to an investment that never pays a worthwhile return. WhatsApp, for example, now faces numerous free-messaging rivals, but its owner, Facebook, has yet to monetize any of its 2 billion users.\n\nWhen a firm is pursuing a successful new business model against intense competition, it’s vital to apply the three value-capture frameworks in the middle of the landscape—industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, and competitive interaction. Consider a business model that investors are now enamored with: electric vehicles. In early April, Tesla had the highest market capitalization of any car company ever and the sixth-highest market cap in the United States (hitting $672 billion on April 12)—more than the combined market caps of Ford, GM, Toyota, Daimler, and Volkswagen. Tesla has certainly identified and exploited an appealing business model, but it’s unclear whether it will ever make a decent return on its investment. Why, if the business model creates so much value for customers? The answer lies in the effect that a promising new business model has on other parts of the strategy landscape.\nTo capture sufficient value, a firm has to be in an industry with an attractive structure and possess a sustainable competitive advantage. Unfortunately, the electric vehicle industry of the future will look remarkably similar to the auto industry of the present. Every carmaker in the world and every company with an interest in electric motors is entering the business. (Even the vacuum cleaner company Dyson invested half a billion dollars in a car design and a plant before realizing the error of its ways.) Given that barriers to entry are low with electric vehicles because of the simplicity of their design and their few (relative to an internal combustion engine) parts, even more companies are likely to jump in. In fact, the quicker the adoption of electric vehicles around the world is, the faster competitors will enter the race and the more rapidly the attractiveness of the industry will deteriorate.\n\nNor is it clear that Tesla has a sustainable competitive advantage. It might have a brand aura and a performance edge today, but its design and engineering expertise will soon be challenged by Porsche and other performance manufacturers, like BMW and Mercedes. Moreover, it’s well behind other auto companies in cumulative production experience and overall scale, so its manufacturing cost position is unenviable. Indeed, the need for scale has led Tesla to add more models—it’s now producing seven—which increases its total output to about 500,000 a year but creates inefficiencies.\n\nTesla also appears to be finding it challenging to realize value through the effective execution of its strategy. The automaker has had enormous quality problems in the United States. (Consumer Reports no longer recommends the Models S and Y.) If you simply cannot achieve operational efficiencies, you are condemned to fail, regardless of how exciting your business model is."

Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album’s title refers to the “aubade”, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n\nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a “fruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.” Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass... more\ncredits\nreleased February 4, 2022\n\n \n\n \n\nMKX\\_300dpi\n\n \n\nCerys Weetch\n\nLabel / A&R Manager\n\nMercury KX, 4 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\n\nM: +44 (0)7792959309\n\nwww.mercurykx.com\n\n---"

Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n\nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n\n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n\nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Saëns' left hand études religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n\n\n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n\nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n\n\n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n\nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's études - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate études to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire étude for left hand solo.\n\n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n\nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n\n\n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n\nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n\n\n7. Diversions - Britten\n\nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n\n\n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n\nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n\n9. Six études for the left hand - Saint-Saëns\n\nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Saëns' piano études are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n\n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n\nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano."

English pop singer Ellie Goulding has cited Blais as an inspiration for her fourth album.[1]\n\nHis debut studio album Il was released in April 2016 on Arts & Crafts, garnering critical acclaim, including making Time magazine's top ten albums of the year list.[2] In 2017, he collaborated with Grammy-nominated English-Canadian electronic artist CFCF on the EP Cascades. His sophomore album, Dans ma main, was released on 11 May 2018, also on Arts & Crafts, and on 30 November 2018 Jean-Michel released Eviction Sessions.\nContents\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n2.1 2016: Il\n2.2 2017: Cascades\n2.3 2018: Dans ma main\n2.4 Eviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\nEarly life\nJean-Michel Blais grew up in the rural town of Nicolet, Quebec.[3] As a young boy, his parents influenced his love of music. While not serious musicians, his father sang in a choir as a child, and his mother would play the organ.[4] Blais began his musical adventures by \"drumming with pots and pans [and] mix-taping Radio-Canada \"world\" music, traditional, Celtic, [Andean], and Eastern European [music]\".[3]\n\nAs a teenager, he took piano lessons, eventually studying at the Trois-Rivières Music Conservatory. However, he found the academic world of music exhausting and restrictive, so he left after two years to travel.[4]\n\nHe travelled to Guatemala, spending several months there working at an orphanage.[4] Looking again for a change, he then moved to Berlin for a year, and then went to South America, spending time in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Finally, Blais decided to settle in Montreal, pursuing a career as a special education teacher.[5] He completed a degree in liberal arts with a minor in psychology while focusing his studies on special education. After graduating, he worked with children with disabilities and behavioural disorders for five years at CEGEP level.\n\nCareer\n2016: Il\nWhile working in special education, Blais slowly rediscovered a fondness for improvising and composing. Blais constructed his debut album, Il, over the course of two years. It was recorded in two days in Blais' apartment with a Zoom recorder, allowing the ambience of his apartment to come through on the recording.[4]\n\nIf people are going to cough and babies are going to cry, instead of trying to hide it, why not embrace it? I like it when I stop and there's something happening outside my window. I think that's why my music has a lot of pauses and silences, because there's always something happening in the street. I'll let it pass and then continue playing.\n\n— Jean-Michel Blais in an interview with the Montreal Gazette[6]\nBlais communicated via Facebook with his friend Devon Bate, credited on the album as BUFFLO, to mix the album. The recording was done in such a manner that the listener feels surrounded by the music.[7] Blais originally released the album via Bandcamp in 2015, where it was discovered by Arts & Crafts, and subsequently given a proper release on 8 April 2016. Arts & Crafts also released the sheet music for the album, along with a deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks that was released in October 2016.[8] The album was widely acclaimed, ranking 10th on Time Magazine's Top 10 Albums of 2016.[2] Exclaim! gave the album 9/10, writing, \"Simply put, Il is a masterpiece.\"[9]\n\n2017: Cascades\nMichael Silver (a.k.a. CFCF) and Blais first collaborated when the Red Bull Music Academy sponsored a live performance featuring the two artists. Blais and Silver found that they lived around the corner from each other, then started finding similarities in their music and composition style.[10] Cascades features two songs each of their solo works, reworked as a duo, and a cover of John Cage's In a Landscape (1948).\nI thought [Jean-Michel's music] was beautiful... I just loved it a bunch, especially because it's so different from a lot of the other piano music that I had tended to listen to...\n\n— Michael Silver (CFCF)\nCascades was also met with critical acclaim. For Pitchfork, Andy Beta opined that it \"finds Silver and Blais warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record's end,\" and called the duo's version of \"In a Landscape\", \"one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable\".[11] Exclaim! also highlighted Blais and Silver's chemistry, reasoning that \"Blais' playing suits very well the pristine and glossy production Silver employed for those recordings, injecting it with a real sense of purpose here,\" giving the album an 8/10.[12]\n\n2018: Dans ma main\nDans ma main is Blais' sophomore solo record, released via Arts & Crafts on 11 May 2018. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10 in an early review, writing \"Far from spiralling inward, as always, Blais lets it all flow through him, and as private becomes public, the result is yet another intimate masterpiece\".[13] On the album, he experiments with different synth and electronic textures, a concept introduced to him while working with CFCF.\n\nBlais explained in a conversation with CFCF and Red Bull Music Academy, \"I never want to lose contact with the original piano instrument, but we have so many tools now to treat it differently than to just have the instrument on its own, so why not use them, and how? It certainly is opening. It gives me sounds and texture possibilities\".[14] The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.[15] In August 2019, Blais released an EP of remixes of Dans ma main.[16]\n\nEviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\nEviction Sessions is Blais' third project, released via Arts & Crafts on 30 November 2018. Eviction Sessions was inspired when Blais was informed he would be evicted from the apartment where he had lived for seven years due to gentrification within his Montreal neighbourhood. This was the same apartment in which Blais recorded his first album of instrumental music, Il. [1]\n\nIn October 2019, Blais released the soundtrack to the Canadian film Matthias & Maxime. He received special mention at the Cannes Soundtrack Award in May of the same year.[17]\n\nIn February 2022, Blais released the album Aubades.[18] The album won the Félix Award for Instrumental Album of the Year at the 44th Félix Awards; it was also nominated for Bestselling Album of the Year, and Blais was a nominee for Most Successful Artist Outside Quebec.[19]\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\nIl (2016)\nDans ma main (2018)\nAubades (2022)\nSoundtracks\n\nMatthias & Maxime (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (2019)\nEPs\n\nCascades with CFCF (2017)\nEviction Sessions (2018)\nDans ma main (Remixes) (2019)[20]\nSingles\n\n\"Nostos\" (2016)\n\"il\" (2016)\n\"roses\" (2018)\n\"blind\" (2018)\n\"forteresse\" (2018)\n\"outsiders\" (2018)\nAppearances\n\n\"Lullaby\" Playing House (Common Holly, 2017)"

This includes the related entities that are associated with the entity being persisted, updated, or removed through the entity's relationships, such as @OneToMany, @OneToOne, @ManyToMany, etc.\n\nFor example, let's consider an `Order` entity that has a one-to-many relationship with `OrderItem` entities. If the `CascadeType.ALL` option is specified on the `Order` entity's `@OneToMany` annotation, then when an `Order` entity is persisted or removed, JPA will automatically persist or remove all the associated `OrderItem` entities as well.\n\nNote that using `CascadeType.ALL` can have some important implications on the performance and behavior of the application, as well as the consistency and integrity of the database. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only when it is necessary and appropriate for the specific use case."

When employees are forced either to wait to get answers or to take chances and act independently, time and material resources are wasted through delay and error. This may be especially troublesome in emergencies when time must be devoted to tracking down a missing manager.\n\nEmployees should perceive a department manager as the employees’ direct conduit when communicating with other organizational elements. This is especially true for interactions with higher management. Employees may perceive a manager who is not readily visible or available as being uninterested and uncaring. This is true for supervisors who seem dedicated primarily to activities such as meetings, committee work, conferences, and the like that occur outside of a department. Such activities put strain on the relationship between supervisor and employees, and the employees begin to see such a supervisor as indifferent and impersonal. For many members of a working group, their department manager is a representative of the organization itself. This supervisor is the member of management that these employees know best and may be the only member of management with whom they have a speaking relationship. If employees perceive their supervisor as being cold, uncaring, and impersonal, then they are likely to perceive the entire organization in the same manner. In most instances, a first-line manager is a worker as well as a manager. These supervisory responsibilities provide an additional resource for a department.

The restaurant's reputation suffers, and customers are less likely to return or recommend the restaurant to others.\n4. A clothing brand uses low-quality materials in their garments, causing them to quickly wear out or fall apart. Customers who have purchased the clothing items become dissatisfied and are less likely to buy from the brand again.\n5. A software company releases a program with numerous bugs and glitches, causing it to crash frequently and fail to perform as advertised. Users become frustrated and may switch to a competitor's software, resulting in lost revenue for the company.\n\nOverall, the poor quality of a product can lead to a variety of negative outcomes, such as decreased sales, damaged reputation, financial losses, legal issues, and dissatisfied customers."

In this case, the crank is rotating at 300 radians per second and has a length of 50 mm, the connecting rod has a length of 170 mm, and the angle between the crank and the connecting rod is 60 degrees.\n2. Calculate the velocity of the connecting rod and the load. To do this, you can use the law of cosines to find the length of the connecting rod and the angle between the connecting rod and the horizontal. Then, use the formula for velocity (v = r x w, where r is the radius and w is the angular velocity) to find the velocity of the connecting rod and the load.\n3. Calculate the acceleration of the connecting rod and the load. To do this, you can use the formula for acceleration (a = r x w^2, where r is the radius and w is the angular velocity) to find the acceleration of the connecting rod and the load.\n4. Draw the velocity and acceleration diagrams for the crank mechanism. To do this, you can use arrows to represent the velocity and acceleration of the crank, the connecting rod, and the load. Make sure to label each arrow with the corresponding velocity or acceleration value.\n5. Use the velocity and acceleration diagrams to determine the linear and angular acceleration of the crank mechanism. To do this, you can use the values you calculated in steps 2 and 3, and apply the appropriate formulas (e.g. linear acceleration = tangential acceleration / radius) to find the linear and angular acceleration of the crank mechanism.\n\nRemember, the key to drawing velocity and acceleration diagrams is to carefully calculate the velocity and acceleration of each part of the mechanism, and to use arrows to represent these values in your diagrams. By following these steps, you should be able to accurately draw the velocity and acceleration diagrams for a crank mechanism."

Before executing the `splitDAO` function, we check to see if the caller has already called it by looking up the value in the `alreadyCalled` mapping. If the value is `true`, we reject the transaction and throw an error.\n\nThis check ensures that each address can only call the `splitDAO` function once per transaction, preventing recursive calls and the associated vulnerability.\n\nRegarding your second question, `uint` is short for \"unsigned integer.\" In Solidity, the programming language used to write smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain, `uint` is a type that represents a positive integer value (i.e., an integer greater than or equal to zero). The `uint` type can have a specified number of bits, such as `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and so on, up to `uint256`, which is the largest `uint` type currently supported by Solidity."

Here's a comparison of running-related features for the Garmin Fenix 5 and Apple Watch Series 4:\n\n1. GPS Accuracy and Performance:\nGarmin Fenix 5: Garmin watches are well-known for their GPS accuracy, and the Fenix 5 is no exception. It uses both GPS and GLONASS satellite systems for accurate tracking during your runs. The watch also allows you to customize GPS settings, such as choosing between GPS-only mode, GPS+GLONASS, or UltraTrac mode, which extends battery life by reducing GPS sampling rate.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 also offers GPS tracking, utilizing GPS and GLONASS satellite systems. The GPS performance is generally accurate, but some users have reported occasional inconsistencies in distance tracking compared to dedicated running watches like the Garmin.\n\n1. Heart Rate Monitoring:\nGarmin Fenix 5: The Fenix 5 includes an optical heart rate sensor, which is reasonably accurate for most activities, including running. However, for maximum accuracy, you can also pair the watch with a chest strap heart rate monitor.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 has an optical heart rate sensor as well, which is known for being accurate during running activities. It also includes electrical heart rate sensors that enable ECG functionality, although this feature is not specifically related to running.\n\n1. Running Metrics and Features:\nGarmin Fenix 5: The Fenix 5 provides advanced running metrics like cadence, vertical oscillation, ground contact time, and more when paired with compatible accessories like the Garmin HRM-Run or HRM-Tri heart rate monitors. Additionally, the watch offers customizable data screens, interval training, and virtual pacer, among other features.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 offers basic running metrics such as distance, pace, and heart rate but lacks some advanced metrics like vertical oscillation and ground contact time. It supports interval training and offers guided workouts through third-party apps like Nike+ Run Club.\n\n1. Battery Life:\nGarmin Fenix 5: The Fenix 5 offers an impressive battery life of up to 2 weeks in smartwatch mode, 24 hours in GPS mode, and up to 60 hours in UltraTrac mode. This extended battery life is particularly useful for long runs, ultramarathons, or multi-day events.\n\nApple Watch Series 4: The Apple Watch Series 4 has a battery life of up to 18 hours, including about 4-6 hours of continuous GPS usage. This battery life is adequate for most runners, but may not be enough for ultra-distance events or multi-day activities.\n\nIn summary, the Garmin Fenix 5 is geared more towards serious runners and outdoor enthusiasts who need advanced running metrics, customization, and longer battery life. The Apple Watch Series 4 is more suitable for casual runners and those looking for a smartwatch with additional non-fitness features. Both watches provide accurate GPS and heart rate tracking, but the Garmin Fenix 5 has an edge when it comes to advanced running features and battery life."

Understand the basics of JavaScript: Node.js is built on JavaScript, so it's essential to have a good understanding of the language first. Make sure you know the fundamentals of JavaScript like variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and objects.\n2. Learn the basics of Node.js: Start by understanding what Node.js is and how it works. Learn about the Node.js runtime environment, the event loop, and non-blocking I/O.\n3. Set up your environment: Install Node.js on your computer and set up your development environment. There are many tools available for this, but some of the most popular are Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.\n4. Write your first Node.js program: Start with a simple \"Hello World\" program to get a feel for how Node.js works. This will help you understand how to run and debug your code.\n5. Learn about the Node.js modules: Node.js has a large ecosystem of modules that you can use to build your applications. Learn about the core modules like fs, http, and path, and explore the npm package manager to discover and install third-party modules.\n6. Build a simple web application: Node.js is often used to build web applications. Start by building a simple web server using the http module, and then add some basic routes and responses. Once you're comfortable with this, move on to building more complex applications using frameworks like Express or Koa.\n7. Learn about asynchronous programming: Asynchronous programming is a core concept in Node.js. Learn about callbacks, promises, and async/await, and how to use them to write asynchronous code.\n8. Dive deeper into Node.js: Once you're comfortable with the basics, start exploring more advanced topics like streams, clusters, and child processes.\n9. Practice, practice, practice: The best way to learn Node.js is to practice writing code. Build your own applications, contribute to open source projects, and participate in online communities to gain experience and improve your skills.\n\nRemember, learning Node.js is an ongoing process. Keep up with the latest updates and developments, and continue to experiment and learn as you build more complex applications. Good luck!"

Because decentralized identifiers are based on blockchain technology, they are theoretically secure and difficult to forge. However, blockchain technology is still relatively new and untested at a large scale, so there may be security vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the system means that there is no central authority overseeing the issuance and management of digital identities, which could make it easier for individuals to create fake or fraudulent identities. Finally, the use of Ethereum as the underlying blockchain platform for the system introduces additional risks, such as the potential for smart contract vulnerabilities and the risks associated with the volatile nature of cryptocurrency."

A module with high cohesion is characterized by having a clear, single purpose and all of its elements work together to achieve that purpose. An example of a module with high cohesion might be a module that performs a specific mathematical calculation, where all of the functions and variables within that module are related to that calculation.\n\nOn the other hand, coupling refers to the degree to which different modules or components of a software system depend on each other. A system with high coupling has many interdependent modules, while a system with low coupling has modules that are independent and can be changed or modified without affecting the rest of the system. An example of a module with low coupling might be a module that displays information to the user, which can be modified or changed without affecting other parts of the system.\n\nIt is generally considered good software design practice to aim for high cohesion and low coupling in a software system. High cohesion helps to make a module easy to understand and maintain, since all of its elements are related to a single purpose. Low coupling helps to make a system more flexible and easier to modify, since changes to one module are less likely to affect other parts of the system."

The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who was discussing the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations with colleagues, when he posed the question, \"Where is everybody?\" suggesting that the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations suggests that they do not exist, or that they are too far away to detect. Various solutions have been proposed to explain the Fermi Paradox, including the possibility that civilizations may not be able to communicate with each other, or that they are avoiding contact with Earth."

E os preços na economia se mantenham iguais ou subam, depois dessa transição.\n[3/7, 2:25 PM] Otávio Bopp: A ideia de que o preço de fontes de energia alternativa sempre serão maiores que petróleo e gas natural é simplesmente retardada\n[3/7, 2:26 PM] Otávio Bopp: Usinas termoelétricas são uma das fontes de energia mais caras para um \\_electric grid\\_. A principal vantagem delas é o menor custo incial, e elas podem ser ligadas e desligadas facilmente, sempre que a demanda necessitar\n[3/7, 2:27 PM] Otávio Bopp: Carros eletricos também são mais eficientes com energia, mas eles são mais caros que carros de combustível comum. \n\nAlso, they need a lot of rare metals. Not exactly a great environmental solution\n[3/7, 2:29 PM] Otávio Bopp: So his premise is wrong in the present for many cases, and this doesn't account for the technological progress that has historically been lowering prices of the energy produced from alternative sources\n[3/7, 2:31 PM] Otávio Bopp: Em diversos casos, fontes de energia alternativa são mais caras do que petróleo e gás natural.\n\nMas mesmo nesses casos, você teria que passar por toda uma equação diferencial antes de dizer que a consequência de uma transição para energia renovável seria negativa para o bem estar da sociedade.\n[3/7, 2:34 PM] Otávio Bopp: E os trabalhos que são criados durante essa transição?\n\nEle nem fala dos trabalhos que serão perdidos na extração de petróleo e gás natural; que é um ponto para dizer que teríamos uma perda de bem estar.\n[3/7, 2:35 PM] Otávio Bopp: E as inúmeras externalidades positivas de ter um ar mais limpo?\n[3/7, 2:36 PM] Otávio Bopp: @gaya, ele faz uma análise tão simples de um assunto tão complexo. E ele nem defende o ponto de vista dele bem\n[3/7, 2:40 PM] Otávio Bopp: Ele não fala dos custos do período de transição. Ele não analisa quantos % mais caro a fonte de energia alternativa seria. \n\nEle simplesmente pula da conclusão -- já infundada -- de que a energia vai ficar mais para, para dizer que o bem estar da sociedade vai piorar\n[3/7, 2:41 PM] Otávio Bopp: Isso é tão ruim que eu não confiaria em nada escrito por esse autor\n[3/7, 2:46 PM] Otávio Bopp: O benefício mais claro de fazer uma transição para fontes de energia limpa é a melhoria da qualidade do ar.\n\nO malefício mais caro não é que essas fontes de energia produzem energia mais cara. É que eles requerem um investimento inicial alto, que poderia ser utilizado para outros fins -- custo de oportunidade"

You made some great arguments, such as pointing out that the premise of the article was flawed, as alternative energy sources are not always more expensive than fossil fuels, and that the author did not consider the positive externalities of having cleaner air.\n\nYou also highlighted that the author did not take into account the jobs that would be created during the transition and the costs associated with the transition itself. Additionally, you mentioned that the initial investment required for renewable energy sources is a cost of opportunity, but the long-term benefits, such as improved air quality and a more sustainable future, outweigh the initial investment.\n\nOverall, you did an excellent job of presenting your case for the economic benefits of transitioning to renewable energy sources.

It's essential to track your carb intake carefully and make sure that you're not going over your daily limit.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to eat lower-carb fruits like berries, avocados, and tomatoes, which are better suited for a keto diet.

        "value": "To create a JSON Web Token (JWT) login system in a Flask REST API, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Install the Flask-JWT library using `pip install Flask-JWT`.\n2. Import the `JWTManager` class from the Flask-JWT library and create an instance of it.\n3. Define a user model with the necessary fields for authentication, such as a username and password. You can use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define the model.\n4. Create a route for logging in and authenticating a user. In this route, you can verify the user's credentials and create a JWT token if they are valid.\n5. Use the `jwt_manager` instance to encode the JWT token with the user's information and return it to the user.\n6. Create a route for protected resources that require authentication. In this route, use the `jwt_required` decorator provided by the `jwt_manager` instance to protect the route.\n7. In the protected route, use the `get_jwt_identity` function provided by the `jwt_manager` instance to get the user's information from the JWT token.\n8. To store invalid tokens, you can create a model in Flask-SQLAlchemy to hold the token and its expiration time. Then, when a user attempts to access a protected resource with an invalid token, you can add the token to this model to prevent them from using it again.\n\nHere is an example of how this can be implemented in Flask:\n```\n# Import the Flask-JWT library and create an instance of the JWTManager\nfrom flask_jwt import JWTManager\njwt_manager = JWTManager()\n\n# Define the user model with Flask-SQLAlchemy\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)\n\n# Set up the Flask app and initialize Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-JWT\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'SECRET_KEY'\ndb.init_app(app)\njwt_manager.init_app(app)\n\n# Define a login route that authenticates the user and returns a JWT token\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\ndef login():\n    username = request.json.get('username')\n    password = request.json.get('password')\n\n    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()\n\n    if user and user.password == password:\n        token = jwt_manager.encode({'id': user.id, 'username': user.username})\n        return jsonify({'token': token})\n    else:\n        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\n\n# Define a model for storing invalid tokens\nclass InvalidToken(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    token = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    expiration = db.Column(\n```"

The `ParticleAnalyzer` class provides a number of different measurements that can be computed, such as the area, perimeter, and Feret diameter of each particle. In this case, we are using the `Measurements.FERET` constant to specify that we want to compute the Feret diameter of each particle."

It is a fitness marketplace where trainers and instructors can list the virtual classes that they do use zoom. The platform integrates with zoom. The attendees can search and browse fitness categories, classes, and trainers. They can follow and book free and paid classes. We are competing with the old-school training where you have to go to your local gym. Since it uses Zoom, the trainer can train people from their home, home gym, or studio. And this also allowed the attendee to work out from home just by watching the Zoom class on their laptop or casting it to their TV in any room of their house. The attendee can shut off their webcam if they like. Working out at home has many benefits, such as not having to pay to belong to a gym or drive to a gym. It also removes the embarrassment and anxiety a person can sometimes have when they first join a gym, and they are out of shape, and everyone else is in shape. Working out at home, they can leave the webcam on or off. And for the disabled, obese, or elderly can even participate right from a chair, couch, bed, or rake rests without feeling like they don't belong in the class. This also has many benefits for the trainer too. Instead of driving to a gym and cutting deals with gyms, they can use the site as a social media platform to get thousands or even millions of followers.\nBut most importantly, if you live in a small rural town in a faraway country, instead of having to serve a small local base of clients, you can now reach millions of people globally, meaning you can use the integrated Zoom platform (Since Fitclass is official partners with Zoom,) to have classes with dozens or even several hundred people. You can charge for classes, but the best thing about our system is our built-in Tips or tipping system. Fitclass encourages our trainers to not have a paywall for their classes or to charge people for their classes. This will limit exposure. By doing classes for Free, it's like Twitch or Youtube live. You, in fact, become a health streamer. You can look at FitClass as a health Streaming Platform. Twitch is for gamers, Youtube live is for content creators, and fitclass.com is for health and wellness professionals to stream their classes live to a global audience and receive real-time tips. Once a person tips, we keep their card on file to make it easy to tip. Just like Youtube has Superthnks for chat tipping and Twitch as Sub tipping, FItclass also has tipping built right into the Zoom app during the training session with our partnership with Zoom. FItclass is free to join for both trainers and attendees. Since the Fitclass platform is free to everyone, it makes money by charging a small nominal service fee on top of classes and taking a small nominal fee from the tips. Among the different classes our trainers can train in are Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Kickboxing, Spinning, Zumba, Body Pump, CrossFit, Bootcamp, Body Combat, Barre, Hot Yoga, TRX, Insanity, P90X, Hot Pilates, Tai Chi, Bikram Yoga, Rowing, Kettlebell, and HIIT."

This will allow us to easily access the largest and smallest values in the list.\n\nNext, we can consider the three largest values in the list. These can be found by taking the last three elements of the sorted list. We can then compute the product of these three values and store it as the maximum product so far.\n\nWe can also consider the two smallest values in the list, which can be found by taking the first two elements of the sorted list. If the product of these two values is negative, we can multiply it with the largest value in the list to potentially get a larger product.\n\nFinally, we can return the maximum product that we have found. Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to solve the problem:\n```\ndef maximum_product(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    return max(nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3], nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1])\n\nprint(maximum_product([-10, -10, 1, 3, 2]))  # 300\nprint(maximum_product([-5, -2, 0, 2, 5]))  # 50\nprint(maximum_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 60\n```\nI hope this helps!

        "value": "Baseline prediction dynamic threshold algorithm is a method to classify data points into two categories based on a threshold value. The threshold value is not fixed and can change based on the distribution of the data points. This algorithm is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the other class.\n\nThe basic idea behind this algorithm is to set the threshold value to be the mean value of the probability scores of the minority class. Any data point with a probability score higher than the threshold value is classified as belonging to the minority class, otherwise, it is classified as belonging to the majority class.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement the Baseline prediction dynamic threshold algorithm in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n\ndef baseline_dynamic_threshold(y_true, y_pred, minority_class):\n    # Calculate the probability scores of the minority class\n    proba = y_pred[:, minority_class]\n    \n    # Calculate the mean probability score of the minority class\n    threshold = np.mean(proba)\n    \n    # Classify data points based on the threshold value\n    y_pred_bin = (proba > threshold).astype(int)\n    \n    # Calculate F1-score of the minority class\n    f1 = f1_score(y_true[:, minority_class], y_pred_bin)\n    \n    return y_pred_bin, f1\n```\nIn this implementation, `y_true` is the true labels of the data points, `y_pred` is the predicted probability scores of the data points, and `minority_class` is the index of the minority class. The function returns the binary predicted labels and the F1-score of the minority class.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Generate a random imbalanced dataset\nX, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)\n\n# Split the dataset into train and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train a logistic regression model on the train set\nclf = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict the probability scores of the test set\ny_pred_proba = clf.predict_proba(X_test)\n\n# Apply the baseline prediction dynamic threshold algorithm\ny_pred_bin, f1 = baseline_dynamic_threshold(y_test, y_pred_proba, 1)\n\n# Print the F1-score of the minority class\nprint(f\"F1-score of the minority class: {f1:.3f}\")\n```\nIn this example, we generate a random imbalanced dataset using the `make_classification` function from scikit-learn. We split the dataset into train and test sets, train a logistic regression model on the train set, and predict the probability scores of the test set. We then apply the `baseline_dynamic_threshold` function to the predicted probability scores and obtain the binary predicted labels and the F1-score of the minority class. Finally, we print the F1-score of the minority class."

The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications.

Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in GitLab. You can use GitLab's built-in CI/CD tools or a third-party tool like Jenkins or CircleCI. The pipeline should trigger whenever changes are pushed to the repository.\n2. In the CI/CD pipeline, use a GitLab runner to clone the repository and build the project. You can use a Docker image or other tools as needed.\n3. Once the project is built, use a deployment tool like Ansible or Terraform to deploy it to the bare metal machine. You can use a configuration file to specify the machine's IP address, credentials, and other details.\n4. Use a tool like rsync or scp to copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to the machine, and then use `docker-compose` to start the project. This assumes that Docker is already installed on the machine.\n5. To fetch the `config.json` file and other custom assets, you can use a tool like `wget` or `curl` to download them from a remote location. You can specify the URL in the configuration file or as an environment variable.\n6. Use a tool like `sed` or `awk` to replace any placeholders in the project's configuration files with values from the `config.json` file or other environment variables.\n7. Finally, start the project and verify that it's running as expected.\n\nThis is just one possible approach, and the specific tools and techniques you use may vary depending on your requirements and preferences. However, this should give you a rough idea of how to get started with automating the deployment of a GitLab-hosted repository to a bare metal machine."

Some of the common tools used in open innovation include crowdsourcing, open source software, innovation contests, and collaborative research and development programs.\n\nCrowdsourcing is a method of obtaining ideas or solutions from a large group of people, usually through an online platform. Open source software is a model for developing software where the source code is made publicly available for anyone to access and modify. Innovation contests are competitions where individuals or teams submit their ideas or solutions to a problem, and the best one is chosen as the winner. Collaborative research and development programs involve partnering with external stakeholders to jointly develop new technologies, products, or services.\n\nThere are also various websites and platforms that can facilitate open innovation, such as InnoCentive, which provides a platform for running innovation contests, and Innocentive@Work, which allows companies to set up their own innovation challenges for employees. Another popular platform is NineSigma, which connects companies with external experts and research institutions for collaborative R&D projects.\n\nOverall, open innovation can provide organizations with access to a broader range of resources and expertise, which can lead to more innovative and successful products and services."

We print the result to the console using Python's `print()` function.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates a practical use case for SQLAlchemy in the banking industry, where we connect to a SQLite database and fetch customer data for analysis.

        "value": "Saving and investing are two different ways to manage your money. Here's the difference:\n\nSaving: Saving involves setting aside a portion of your income for future use, usually in a low-risk and easily accessible account such as a savings account or a money market fund. The goal of saving is to accumulate funds over time, so that you can use them to meet short-term or long-term financial goals, such as buying a car, paying for a wedding, or building an emergency fund.\n\nInvesting: Investing involves using your money to buy assets that have the potential to increase in value over time, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate. The goal of investing is to grow your wealth over time, so that you can achieve long-term financial goals, such as retirement, buying a house, or funding your children's education.\n\nThe key difference between saving and investing is the level of risk involved. Saving involves putting your money in low-risk accounts that offer low returns, whereas investing involves taking on more risk in the hopes of earning higher returns over the long run. Additionally, while savings is typically used for short-term goals, investing is generally a long-term strategy."

        "value": "Yes, it is possible to use Selenium with GitHub and Jenkins to trigger automated tests on specific events and to only re-run failed test cases.\n\nHere are the general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Setup your GitHub repository and Jenkins environment.\n2. Create a Jenkins job to run your Selenium tests.\n3. Configure the Jenkins job to trigger on specific events, such as a pull request or commit.\n4. Use a plugin like the Jenkins GitHub plugin to allow Jenkins to access your GitHub repository and pull in the necessary code changes.\n5. Use a test framework like TestNG or JUnit to run your Selenium tests and generate reports.\n6. Configure your test framework to only re-run failed test cases. For example, with TestNG, you can use the `rerun-failed` option to automatically re-run failed tests.\n\nHere's an example Jenkinsfile that demonstrates how to trigger a Selenium test job on a pull request event, and only re-run failed test cases:\n```typescript\npipeline {\n    agent any\n\n    stages {\n        stage('Run Selenium Tests') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'mvn clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    post {\n        always {\n            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'\n        }\n\n        success {\n            echo 'All tests passed!'\n        }\n\n        failure {\n            echo 'Some tests failed. Rerunning failed tests...'\n            sh 'mvn clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml -Dtestng.groups=retry'\n            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we're using Maven to run our Selenium tests with TestNG. The `testng.xml` file specifies which tests to run and how to group them. We're also using the `rerun-failed` feature of TestNG to automatically re-run any failed tests.\n\nIn the `post` section of the Jenkinsfile, we're using the TestNG plugin to generate test reports. We're also checking if any tests failed, and if so, we're re-running them with the `-Dtestng.groups=retry` option.\n\nWith this setup, Jenkins will automatically trigger our Selenium test job on a pull request event, and only re-run failed test cases if necessary."

        "value": "Certainly, here's a module on how Control Tower can work to build a unique relationship with the customer by constantly asking ourselves \"HOW\" do we know, \"WHAT\" do we know and \"WHEN\" do we know, and breaking it down into seven categories.\n\nModule: Building a Unique Relationship with Customers through Control Tower\n\nIntroduction:\nControl Tower is a centralized hub that allows companies to gain end-to-end visibility and control over their supply chain operations. One of the main objectives of a Control Tower is to build a unique relationship with customers by providing them with accurate and timely information, while also anticipating their needs and requirements. This module will explore how Control Tower can work as a rule of thumb to achieve this objective by constantly asking ourselves \"HOW\" do we know, \"WHAT\" do we know and \"WHEN\" do we know. Additionally, we will break it down into seven categories that help in building a unique relationship with customers.\n\n1. Visibility\nThe first step in building a unique relationship with customers is to have complete visibility into their supply chain operations. Control Tower should have access to all the relevant data from the customer's operations, including inventory levels, shipments, and order status. With this information, Control Tower can identify potential issues before they become problems and provide the customer with proactive solutions. It also enables the Control Tower to provide the customer with real-time updates on their operations and ensure timely delivery of goods.\n2. Communication\nClear communication is critical to building a unique relationship with customers. Control Tower should have a dedicated point of contact with the customer to ensure effective communication. The communication should be proactive, transparent, and timely. The Control Tower should update the customer regularly on the status of their shipments and any potential issues that may arise.\n3. Collaboration\nCollaboration is key to building a unique relationship with customers. Control Tower should work closely with the customer to understand their unique requirements and tailor solutions to meet their needs. The Control Tower should work collaboratively with the customer's suppliers and carriers to ensure seamless operations. It is also essential to engage with the customer's stakeholders, such as sales and marketing teams, to understand their priorities and how the supply chain can support their business objectives.\n4. Performance Management\nControl Tower should have a robust performance management system in place to track the customer's supply chain performance continually. The system should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time delivery, inventory accuracy, and order accuracy. The Control Tower should use this information to identify areas for improvement and work collaboratively with the customer to implement corrective actions.\n5. Continuous Improvement\nControl Tower should always strive for continuous improvement in the customer's supply chain operations. This involves regularly reviewing the KPIs and identifying areas for improvement. The Control Tower should then work with the customer to implement corrective actions and measure the impact of these actions. It is also essential to encourage feedback from the customer and use this feedback to drive continuous improvement.\n6. Risk Management\nControl Tower should proactively manage risks to the customer's supply chain operations. This involves identifying potential risks, assessing their impact, and developing contingency plans. The Control Tower should work collaboratively with the customer to implement these plans and ensure minimal disruption to their operations.\n7. Technology\nFinally, Control Tower should leverage technology to build a unique relationship with customers. The Control Tower should have a robust technology infrastructure in place to enable real-time data sharing, automated workflows, and predictive analytics. This infrastructure should be flexible enough to accommodate the customer's unique requirements and scalable to support their growth.\n\nConclusion:\nBuilding a unique relationship with customers is critical to the success of a Control Tower. By following these seven categories, Control Tower can ensure complete visibility into the customer's supply chain operations, effective communication, collaboration, performance management, continuous improvement,"

However, here is a simple example of how you might use Python to create an algorithm that automatically executes stop-loss orders:\n```\n# define a function to execute a stop-loss order\ndef stop_loss_order(security, price):\n  # if the current price of the security is below the specified price, sell the security\n  if security.price < price:\n    security.sell()\n\n# define a function to check all securities in the portfolio and execute any necessary stop-loss orders\ndef check_stop_loss_orders():\n  # loop through each security in the portfolio\n  for security in portfolio:\n    # if a stop-loss order has been set for the security, execute it\n    if security.has_stop_loss_order():\n      stop_loss_order(security, security.stop_loss_price)\n\n# run the check_stop_loss_orders function on a regular basis (e.g. every hour)\nwhile True:\n  check_stop_loss_orders()\n  time.sleep(3600) # sleep for 1 hour\n```\nThis is just a simple example to illustrate the concept, and it would need to be adapted and expanded based on your specific requirements. But it shows how you can use Python to create algorithms that can help you manage risks in your fund."

        "value": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of text data involves analyzing and understanding the characteristics and patterns present in the textual data. The following are some of the key steps involved in EDA of text data:\n\n1. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: The first step in EDA of text data is to clean and pre-process the data to remove any unwanted characters, stop words, punctuation, and other noise from the text. This step is important to ensure that the data is in a format that can be easily analyzed.\n2. Tokenization: Tokenization involves breaking the text into individual words or phrases, known as tokens. This step is important for analyzing the frequency and distribution of words in the text.\n3. Frequency Analysis: Once the data has been cleaned and tokenized, the next step is to perform a frequency analysis to identify the most common words and phrases in the text. This can help identify any patterns or trends in the data.\n4. Visualization: Visualization techniques such as word clouds, bar charts, and scatter plots can be used to visualize the frequency and distribution of words in the text. This can help identify any patterns or trends in the data that may not be immediately apparent from the raw text.\n5. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis involves analyzing the emotional tone of the text to determine whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. This can be useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media posts, and other forms of text data.\n6. Topic Modeling: Topic modeling involves identifying the key topics or themes present in the text. This can be useful for identifying patterns or trends in the data that may not be immediately apparent from a frequency analysis.\n\nOverall, EDA of text data is an important step in understanding the characteristics and patterns present in textual data. By analyzing the frequency, distribution, sentiment, and topics present in the text, it is possible to gain insights into the underlying patterns and trends in the data."

This exercise is divided into 3 parts : 1) backend filtering funtion and API endpoint (node.js) 2) front-end reusable component to plug and play (javascript, html,css) 3) system design for autocomplete service"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Sure, I can help you with that!\n\n1. Backend filtering function and API endpoint:\n\nTo create a backend filtering function and API endpoint to search hotels by name, you can use Node.js and create an endpoint that accepts a query parameter for the hotel name. You can then use a database to store information about the hotels, and use a query to filter the results based on the name. Here's an example of what the code might look like:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// Database connection and schema definition here\n\napp.get('/hotels', async (req, res) => {\n  const name = req.query.name;\n  const hotels = await Hotel.find({ name: { $regex: new RegExp(name, 'i') } }).exec();\n  res.json(hotels);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));\n```\nThis code sets up an Express app with an endpoint at `/hotels` that accepts a query parameter called `name`. It then uses the `Hotel` schema to query the database and find all hotels that match the given name using a case-insensitive regular expression. Finally, it returns the results as JSON.\n\n2. Front-end reusable component to plug and play:\n\nTo create a front-end component that can be reused to search for hotels by name, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a search bar with an autocomplete feature. Here's an example of what the code might look like:\n```css\n<!-- HTML -->\n\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"hotel-search\" placeholder=\"Search for a hotel\">\n\n<!-- CSS -->\n\n#hotel-search {\n  width: 300px;\n  padding: 8px;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n\n.autocomplete-items {\n  position: absolute;\n  z-index: 999;\n  top: 100%;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  max-height: 200px;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-top: none;\n  border-radius: 0 0 4px 4px;\n}\n\n.autocomplete-item {\n  padding: 8px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  background-color: #fff;\n}\n\n.autocomplete-item:hover {\n  background-color: #f4f4f4;\n}\n\n.autocomplete-item.active {\n  background-color: #e9e9e9;\n}\n\n<!-- JavaScript -->\n\nconst hotelSearch = document.querySelector('#hotel-search');\nconst autocompleteContainer = document.createElement('div');\nautocompleteContainer.setAttribute('class', 'autocomplete-items');\nhotelSearch.parentNode.appendChild(autocompleteContainer);\n\nhotelSearch.addEventListener('input', async () => {\n  const response = await fetch(`/hotels?name=${hotelSearch.value}`);\n  const hotels = await response.json();\n\n  autocompleteContainer.innerHTML = '';\n  hotels.forEach(hotel => {\n    const item = document.createElement('div');\n    item.innerHTML = hotel.name;\n    item.addEventListener('click', () => {\n      hotelSearch.value = hotel.name;\n      autocompleteContainer.innerHTML = '';\n    });\n    autocompleteContainer.appendChild(item);\n  });\n});\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n  if (!event.target.matches('#hotel-search')) {\n    autocompleteContainer.innerHTML = '';\n  }\n});\n```\nThis code creates an input field with an ID of `hotel-search`, as well as a container for the autocomplete items. It then adds an event listener to the input field that sends a request to the `/hotels` endpoint whenever the input changes, and populates the autocomplete container with the results. Finally, it adds event listeners to the items to update the input field and clear the autocomplete container"

Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game that allows players to create characters and embark on adventures in a fantasy world. The game is typically played with a group of players, each taking on the role of a unique character, while one player acts as the Dungeon Master (DM), who creates and narrates the story, controls non-player characters, and adjudicates the rules.\n\nThe basic rules of the game involve rolling dice to determine the outcomes of actions and resolving conflicts between characters and the environment. The most commonly used dice in Dungeons and Dragons are a 20-sided die (d20), a 12-sided die (d12), a 10-sided die (d10), an 8-sided die (d8), a 6-sided die (d6), and a 4-sided die (d4).\n\nIn addition to rolling dice, characters have abilities, skills, and spells that they can use to interact with the game world. Each character has a set of attributes, such as strength, dexterity, and intelligence, that define their capabilities and limitations.\n\nThe rules of Dungeons and Dragons are quite complex, and there are many books and resources available that provide detailed information on character creation, combat, magic, and other aspects of the game. If you have specific questions about the rules of Dungeons and Dragons, I'd be happy to try to answer them for you."

Here are a few steps you could follow to accomplish this:\n\n1. Identify the approximate position of the hips relative to the headset and controllers. You can do this by examining the player's body movements and determining where the hips are likely to be located in relation to the other tracked points.\n2. Use the position and rotation data from the headset and controllers to estimate the position of the hips. One way to do this is to use inverse kinematics (IK), which is a technique used in animation and robotics to determine the joint angles required to achieve a specific end position. In this case, you can use IK to determine the position of the hips based on the known positions of the headset and controllers.\n3. Refine the estimated position of the hips based on additional information. For example, you may be able to use machine learning algorithms to learn patterns in the player's movements and use that information to improve the accuracy of the estimated hip position.\n4. Continuously update the estimated position of the hips based on the incoming position and rotation data from the headset and controllers. This will help ensure that the estimated hip position remains accurate even as the player moves around and changes positions.\n\nOverall, accurately tracking the position of the hips can be a challenging problem, but using a combination of techniques such as IK and machine learning can help you approximate the position of the hips with a reasonable degree of accuracy."

I got a new requirement that the load balancer should look for an element in the response XML and, when present, consider the web server that produced it as overloaded and throttle requests to it. Available options are augmenting httpd's configuration or replacing it with a new (open source) Linux software LB. Traffic is <100 reqs/sec and less than 2MB/sec, latency is not an issue.\nHaving a software engineering background my instinct is to program an LB of my own and be done, but supporting that would require upskilling my team (who are not software engineers). With respect to existing LBs/API gateways, what are my options?"

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "There are several options available to you for implementing this new requirement:\n\n1. Using Apache httpd with mod\\_xml: You can use mod\\_xml to parse the response XML and look for the element you're interested in. If the element is present, you can use mod\\_rewrite to redirect requests to a different web server. This approach has the advantage of being easy to implement and not requiring any additional software.\n2. Using Nginx: Nginx is a popular open source web server that also has a load balancing module. Nginx can be configured to inspect response headers and modify the load balancing algorithm accordingly. Nginx also supports Lua scripting, which can be used to parse the XML response and implement the required logic.\n3. Using HAProxy: HAProxy is another popular open source load balancer that can inspect response headers and modify the load balancing algorithm accordingly. HAProxy also supports Lua scripting, which can be used to parse the XML response and implement the required logic.\n4. Developing a custom load balancer: If you have the software engineering skills and the resources to develop a custom load balancer, this is an option. However, this approach requires significant time and resources to implement and maintain, and may not be the best use of your team's time and skills.\n\nOverall, using an existing load balancer or API gateway with XML parsing capabilities, such as Apache httpd with mod\\_xml, Nginx, or HAProxy, would likely be the most efficient and effective option for implementing this requirement."

        "value": "Part 1: Introduction to Linux\n\nLinux is an open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a Unix-like operating system and has since become one of the most popular operating systems in the world.\n\nLinux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is open-source, which means that anyone can view and modify the source code. This has led to a community-driven development model, where thousands of developers contribute to the codebase, fix bugs, and add new features.\n\nThere are many different distributions, or versions, of Linux, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS. Each distribution has its own set of default software packages, package management system, and user interface. Some distributions are designed for specific use cases, such as server deployment or multimedia production.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Linux is its stability. Linux systems are known to run for years without needing to be rebooted, which makes them ideal for servers and other critical systems. Linux is also very secure, with a robust set of built-in security features and a large community of security experts who actively work to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n\nLinux is also very flexible. It can run on a wide range of hardware platforms, from small embedded devices to massive supercomputers. It can also be customized to meet specific needs, with users able to choose from a vast array of software packages and desktop environments.\n\nBasic Linux commands are essential for anyone using Linux. These include cd (change directory), ls (list files and directories), mkdir (create a new directory), touch (create a new file), and many others. These commands allow users to navigate the file system, create and manage files and directories, and perform various other tasks.\n\nThe file system hierarchy in Linux is organized in a hierarchical structure. The root directory (/) is at the top of the hierarchy, and all other directories are subdirectories of the root directory. The most commonly used directories include /home (user home directories), /usr (user programs), and /etc (system configuration files).\n\nInstalling Linux can be done in several ways, including dual-booting, where Linux is installed alongside another operating system on the same computer, or using a virtual machine, where Linux is installed as a guest operating system inside another operating system. There are also many different installation methods, depending on the distribution being used."

The `@@index` attribute takes an array of column names to create an index on. In this case, we've specified `[id]` to create an index on the `id` column.\n\nOnce you've added the index to your Prisma schema, you'll need to apply the schema changes to your database. You can do this by running the following command:\n```css\nnpx prisma migrate dev --name add-index-to-conversations\n```\nThis will create a new migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory with the name `add-index-to-conversations`. You can then apply the migration by running:\n```\nnpx prisma migrate dev\n```\nThis will apply the migration to your database and create the index on the `id` column of the `conversations` table.

        "value": "Sure, here are some Node.js technical questions and answers you can ask during an interview:\n\n1. What is Node.js, and what are its benefits?\nAnswer: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. The benefits of using Node.js include its ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections, its fast performance, and its scalability.\n2. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?\nAnswer: Synchronous programming in Node.js means that the code execution is blocked until the task is completed, while asynchronous programming means that the code continues to run while the task is being completed. Asynchronous programming is more efficient in Node.js as it allows for non-blocking I/O operations.\n3. What is the event loop in Node.js, and how does it work?\nAnswer: The event loop is a key feature of Node.js that allows it to handle multiple requests simultaneously. It works by constantly monitoring the Node.js environment for new events such as I/O operations or incoming requests. When an event occurs, the event loop sends it to a callback function to be processed.\n4. What are the core modules in Node.js, and how do you use them?\nAnswer: Core modules in Node.js are built-in modules that you can use without installing any additional packages. Examples include the HTTP module for creating web servers, the File System module for working with files, and the Path module for working with file paths. You can use these modules by requiring them at the beginning of your code file.\n5. How do you handle errors in Node.js?\nAnswer: In Node.js, errors can be handled using try-catch blocks or by using the error event. You can also use the built-in assert module to write unit tests that check for errors. Additionally, many third-party packages provide their own error-handling mechanisms.\n6. What is the difference between require() and import in Node.js?\nAnswer: require() is a CommonJS module system used in Node.js to load modules, while import is part of the ES6 module system. require() is a synchronous operation, while import is asynchronous. Additionally, import allows for more granular control over what is imported, while require() imports the entire module.\n7. How do you handle CORS in Node.js?\nAnswer: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is handled in Node.js using middleware such as cors or helmet. These packages allow you to specify which domains are allowed to access your server's resources, preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, you can set headers in your server's response to indicate that CORS is allowed.\n\nI hope these questions and answers help you prepare for your Node.js interview!"

Based on the count, it sets the status of the user to either `Queue.STATUS.PENDING` or `Queue.STATUS.WAITING_CONNECTION`.\n3. It adds the user to the queue in the database by calling the `findOrCreate` method of the `db.models.Queue` object, with the user's UNCT, ID, and status.\n4. It returns the current position of the user in the queue by calling `Queue.getCurrentPositionInfo` with the user object.\n\nOverall, this code appears to be adding a user to a queue in a database and determining the user's status in the queue based on the number of other users in the queue and a minimum connected configuration value."

These tokens can be traded on digital marketplaces, allowing individuals to buy and sell their stakes in a particular Learning Object.\n4. Subscription models: Develop subscription-based services that grant users access to a library of Learning Objects. The subscription fees can be distributed among the content creators and owners according to their share of ownership.\n5. Crowdfunding: Use crowdfunding platforms to finance the creation and maintenance of Learning Objects. Contributors can receive fractional ownership in return for their financial support.\n6. Co-creation platforms: Build platforms that allow multiple parties to collaborate on the creation, editing, and maintenance of Learning Objects. Contributors can earn fractional ownership based on their level of involvement and input.\n7. Licensing agreements: Establish flexible licensing agreements that allow multiple parties to use and modify Learning Objects while respecting the rights of the original creators and owners.\n8. Open-source models: Encourage open-source development of Learning Objects, allowing for community-driven improvements and modifications. Contributors can receive fractional ownership based on their contributions to the project.\n9. Educational cooperatives: Form cooperatives of educators, institutions, or organizations to collaboratively create, maintain, and share Learning Objects. Members of the cooperative can benefit from fractional ownership and shared access to the materials.\n10. Revenue-sharing models: Implement revenue-sharing models that distribute the earnings from the sale or usage of Learning Objects among the owners based on their share of ownership. This can incentivize creators and owners to produce high-quality content and promote collaboration.\n\nBy exploring these ideas, fractional ownership in Learning Objects can become a reality, ultimately benefiting learners, educators, and content creators alike."

Verify that firewalls are configured correctly to allow traffic between the machines.\n2. Increase timeout settings: You can try increasing the timeout settings in your rpyc configuration file to give the connection more time to establish. You can also try adjusting other connection settings, such as the maximum number of retries, to see if that resolves the issue.\n3. Monitor system resources: If the virtual machines are running low on system resources, such as memory or CPU, it could cause connectivity issues. Monitor the resource usage on each machine and allocate more resources as needed.\n4. Update rpyc: Check to see if there are any updates to rpyc that may have addressed the issue you're experiencing.\n5. Check logs: Review the logs on both virtual machines to see if there are any error messages that may provide more insight into the issue.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to consult with the rpyc community or seek assistance from a network or virtualization expert."

You can install these libraries using the following command:\n```diff\n!pip install numpy matplotlib\n```\nHere's a sample code that applies STFT to a financial time series using Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Generate a random financial time series\nnp.random.seed(0)\nN = 1000\nt = np.arange(N)\nx = np.sin(0.1*t) + np.random.normal(size=N)\n\n# Define the window and overlap parameters\nwindow_size = 100\noverlap = 50\n\n# Apply STFT to the time series\nf, t, Zxx = signal.stft(x, nperseg=window_size, noverlap=overlap)\n\n# Plot the spectrogram\nplt.pcolormesh(t, f, np.abs(Zxx), vmin=0, vmax=2)\nplt.ylabel('Frequency [Hz]')\nplt.xlabel('Time [sec]')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n```\nIn this code, we first generate a random financial time series of length `N`. We then define the window size and overlap parameters for STFT. We use the `signal.stft` function from the `scipy` library to apply STFT to the time series. This function returns the frequency array `f`, the time array `t`, and the complex STFT array `Zxx`. We take the absolute value of `Zxx` to obtain the spectrogram.\n\nFinally, we plot the spectrogram using the `pcolormesh` function from the `matplotlib` library. The `vmin` and `vmax` parameters are used to set the color scale. We also add labels for the frequency and time axes and a colorbar to indicate the color scale. The resulting plot shows the time-varying frequency content of the financial time series."

The objective is to score points by carrying or throwing the ball into the end zone of the opponent's field. Here are some basic rules:\n\n1. The game starts with a kickoff, where one team kicks the ball to the other team.\n2. Players can either run with the ball (called a \"rush\") or throw it to a teammate (called a \"pass\").\n3. If a player is holding the ball and is tackled (hit) to the ground, the play is over.\n4. Teams take turns playing offense (trying to score) and defense (trying to stop the other team from scoring).\n5. Points can be scored in several ways, including rushing or passing the ball into the end zone, kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts (called a \"field goal\"), or catching a touchdown pass.\n6. Each game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 15 minutes.\n7. If the score is tied at the end of four quarters, the game goes into overtime. The first team to score in overtime wins the game.\n8. Some common penalties include holding (grabbing onto another player's jersey), offsides (starting a play before the ball is snapped), and unsportsmanlike conduct (behaving badly).\n9. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and learn the game!"

They loved the Beatles' music so much that they even named their colony after the band, calling it \"Fairy-Beatle\".\n\nOne day, while the Beatles were performing at the famous Cavern Club, a fairy named Lirien snuck in to watch the show. She was so entranced by their music that she accidentally revealed herself to the crowd by flying too close to the stage. But instead of being scared, the Beatles and the crowd were delighted by the tiny fairy's presence.\n\nAfter the show, the Beatles invited Lirien to meet them backstage. She was overjoyed, and her friends and family in Fairy-umple were thrilled to hear of her adventure. The Beatles even asked Lirien to be their fairy muse, and they wrote many songs inspired by her and the other fairies and elves of Fairy-umple.\n\nFrom that day on, the Beatles and the fairies and elves of Fairy-umple were the best of friends. They would often have jam sessions together, and the Beatles would even sneak away from their tours to visit Fairy-umple and play with their fairy friends.\n\nThe music of the Beatles and the magic of the fairies and elves brought joy to the people of Liverpool and beyond, and their friendship was a true inspiration to all who heard their songs.\n\nThe end."

It is similar to a regular function in that it can take arguments and return values, but it is defined without a name, and it exists only within the scope where it is defined.\n\nLambdas in C++ were introduced with the C++11 standard and are a powerful feature that allows for more concise and expressive code. A lambda can capture variables from the surrounding scope, allowing it to use values from the context where it was defined. The capture can be done either by value or by reference.\n\nHere's an example of a simple lambda in C++:\n```java\nauto myLambda = [] (int x, int y) -> int {\n    return x + y;\n};\n\nint result = myLambda(2, 3);  // result is now 5\n```\nIn this example, we define a lambda that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. We use the `auto` keyword to let the compiler deduce the return type, and we specify the types of the arguments in the parameter list. The `-> int` part after the parameter list specifies the return type.\n\nWe then call the lambda with arguments `2` and `3` and assign the result to a variable `result`.\n\nLambdas can be used in many different contexts, such as sorting algorithms, event handling, and more. They provide a concise way to define small, self-contained functions that can be used inline within larger expressions."

The EAGLES fluttered, hopped and scurried about in the bubbly white surf, their chatter and song filling the tropical sea air and Joey’s young mind. \n\nJoey was about the same age as the youthful EAGLES out there on the sand bar. Those EA-GLES had dark feathers like Joey as they had not developed the white head and tail feathers of the older bald EAGLES. Joey did not look at all like Livie, his brightly colored osprey sister who was older than Joey. \n\nJoey felt a gentle morning breeze as he looked out along his broad wings colored dark grey with white mottling. The breeze raised up the ends of the contour feathers along the leading edge of Joey’s wings and slightly ruffled his long wing tip primary feathers. Joey wondered if his wings would sustain his flight on great thermal air currents on his dream to soar all the way up to the top of the sky.\n\nAfter noontime Joey watched as the EAGLES lifted slowly upward in flapping flight high above their bay world of sand, sea, and tropical keys until they were soaring on warm upwelling thermal currents. With their wings fully outstretched they spiraled higher and higher upward.\n\nAs Joey watched the EAGLES with intense admiration they slowly soared through misty white vapor into a billowing and radiant cumulus cloud that floated above in the vast ocean of blue sky. Then all of the EAGLES disappeared into the cloud. \n\nJoey's head swam with dizzying visions of soaring way up there into white towering clouds. \n\n“One day soon I will surely soar to the top of the sky like those EAGLES,” thought Joey.\n\nThen Joey heard a rushing and fluttering of wing feathers and turned his head to see a long-winged bird turn into the wind and level out on a glide directly toward him. With its great wings fully outstretched and its tail fanned and lowered, this winsomely white bird cut a strik-ing figure as it loomed upon the nest. \n\nThe great bird stretched its head and long white legs with taloned feet forward and raised its wings up and back with long primary feathers splayed. The bird seized onto a thick branch at the edge of the nest and tipped forward unstably. Then it quickly rotated its wings revealing a distinctive bold patterning of brown and black across their undersides as the bird recovered to an upright position. \n\n“Ahoy there my little avian predator!” exclaimed the bird as she folded her long wings and set-tled into a resting position at the edge of the nest. \n\n“Hello Livie,” replied Joey still crouched in the thicket of the large protective nest.\n\n“And what kind of day is our youngest raptor having?” asked Joey’s sister Livie. \n\n“I have been watching the EAGLES, Livie,” replied Joey. “They were fishing, playing, and sunning out there on that sand bar and the key just beyond it. Then the EAGLES went soaring right up into those clouds.” \n\n“I want to soar up there to the top of the sky!” exclaimed Joey. “Would you like to go soaring with me, Livie?”\n\n“Sure Joey, in a while,” replied Livie. \n\nThen Joey began dragging a favorite stick across the nest bed. \n\n“You’re such a kid Joey!” exclaimed Livie as she hopped down into the nest and grabbed the other end of the stick with her bill engaging Joey in a friendly game of tug of war. \n\nJoey pulled his stick free from Livie's grasp and won the tug. Then Livie picked up a tuft of grass from the nest bed and playfully tossed it at Joey. \n\n“Oh Joey I remember you always romping and playing on the nest with some odd shaped sticks and sea shells,” said Livie. “Those were some of your favorite toys and you would spend count-less hours leaping upon them, pecking at them, caressing them, tossing them into the air and then catching them with your feet before they hit the nest.“\n\n“I know that Livie, but now I just want to go soaring. Will you go soaring with me?” asked Jo-ey.\n\n“All right Joey you’re on!” shouted Livie as she began flapping her wings and lifted off sky-ward.\n\n“That’s great!” exclaimed Joey, as he began flapping his wings and lifted off from the nest. Jo-ey heard the song of the heart rushing through his mind as the world became smaller below. \n\nBy now the clouds boiling up above the bay were indicating strong thermals in a sky laden with moisture which was energizing the thermals. The clouds were growing larger, bubbling and bursting upward with great speed. \n\nJoey and his sister Livie lifted up on broad wings high above their tropical nest key until they were soaring on wide upwelling thermal currents. They flapped and soared in the direction of some brilliant white clouds.\n\nAs Livie and Joey flew through shadows cast down below the clouds they felt the rush of ther-mal currents that were feeding into the growing cumulus clouds. \n\nWith their wings fully outstretched now Livie and Joey spiraled higher and higher until their nest key was just a small but shining emerald among the many green keys sprinkled off the southern tip of the Everglades across Florida Bay. \n\nAs they continued to soar upward on strong thermal currents, Livie and Joey headed toward a developing cumulus cloud that was billowing out in front of some darker clouds. \n\nAs the two youngsters approached the cloud, Joey exclaimed: “Wow, look at the top of that cloud bursting upwards!”\n\n“I see it Joey,” replied Livie.\n\nThe warm air currents were rushing up beneath their wings as Livie and Joey entered gray mist at the base of the cloud. “Don’t stiffen up! Stay relaxed Joey!” shouted Livie. \n\nThey soared through misty vapor into the billowing and radiant cumulus cloud. \n\n“Sharpen your turn and stay within the up draft!” shouted Livie as the strong thermal pushed them upward. \n\nJoey felt the exhilaration of the warm air pushing up under his wing and body feathers. Then he was jolted by a strong gust which ruffled his long wing-tip primary feathers and thrust up the ends of the contour feathers along the leading edge of his wings. \n\n“This is awesome!” yelled Joey as the thermal current pushed them higher and higher inside the cloud. \n\nBy now Joey could see feelers of lightening branching off in all directions above them. \n\nThen Joey and Livie were buffeted by strong wind turbulence inside the great cloud which tossed them around. \n\nJoey felt muscles and tendons straining and saw feathers bending out along his wings as he tried to recover stable flight. \n\nThe shearing winds of a down draft slammed into Joey pushing him downward. \nThen strong gusts superimposed upon the down draft tossed Joey upside down. \n\n“I’m out of control!” thought Joey as fear clouded his mind. \n\nBrilliant light surrounded Joey as he was thrust out the side of the great cumulus cloud.\n\n“Wow that was the greatest experience of my life!” shouted Joey as he looked around. Joey could not see Livie as dark gray cloud now whizzed past his face. So Joey flew toward home on a long flat glide. \n\nJoey spotted Livie already back at their key. There sat Livie perched on a branch above their nest overlooking the grassy green meadow at the center of the key. Joey flew directly toward her and alighted onto the nest. \n\n“How did you get back here so fast Livie?” asked Joey. \n\n“I tumbled and turned every which way right out the side of the cloud!” exclaimed Livie. \n\n“That’s exactly what happened to me and I loved it!” exclaimed Joey. “I want to soar even higher into the greatest cloud next time!” \n\n“Oh Joey you don’t know the half of it,” remarked Livie. \n\n“What do you mean?” asked Joey.\n\n“The greatest cloud you speak of is the great storm!” exclaimed Livie. \n\n“So what?” asked Joey. \n\n“Mom said if you soar high into the storm there is great turbulence around the freezing level and you could collide with balls of ice that are tossing and churning up and down inside the cloud!” answered Livie. \n\n“That’s so cool!” exclaimed Joey. \n\n“It’s not funny,” replied Livie. “You must also watch out for strong shear currents created be-tween the downdraft and the thermal air flowing upward into the cloud. I’ve heard that the shearing winds between those up drafts and down drafts have torn birds apart!”\n\n“I still want to soar higher!” exclaimed Joey. “I want to soar to the top of the sky!” \n\n“I have heard that those up drafts and down drafts aren't even clearly defined as we just experi-enced for ourselves, Joey. There are strong gusts superimposed upon the up and down drafts which are rolling, tumbling and turning every which way,” remarked Livie. \n\n“Well, I had almost recovered to stable flight and was trying to stay within the up draft like you told me to do before I was tossed about and pushed out of the cloud by those crosswinds,” said Joey. \n\n“Stable flight is always a good feeling when we can do it. But most importantly Mom said we must learn to bend without breaking,” added Livie. \n\n“Okay then I will soar and bend right up to the top of the sky!” shouted Joey. \n\n“Look Joey here comes Mom and she’s clutching a big fish. Will she drop that fish\non the nest or will she dine in with us?” asked Livie as she began narrating Mom’s arrival.\n\n“And now Mom glides in, a magnificent specimen of a sea HAWK,” said Livie.\n\n“Mom hovers above the nest for a moment, then drops down to the nest with great wings raised up high, and with her head erect and legs wide apart she touches down for a perfect landing,” continued Livie with her narration. \n\n“Now Mom will prepare the meal of freshly caught seafood as her youngsters sit side by side with their necks craning forward and eyes watching intently as Mom carves the dinner.”\n\n“Oh cut it out Livie!” exclaimed Mom. “Now let's have dinner!”\n\nThen Mom passed tasty chunks of white meat to Livie and Joey from her bill to their bills and intermittently swallowed a piece of fish herself. \n\nAfter eating Mom flew over to a buttonwood tree and began grooming her feathers. \n\n“Now tell me Livie, have you tasted the mystical berries?” asked Joey. \n\n“What are mystical berries?” replied Livie. \n\n“They are berries that fall to the ground and accumulate in a sump under the mystic tree. I have often eaten those berries with my friends. The mystical berries make me feel happy and strong. Then my friends and I soared, whirled around and around and talon locked all afternoon having great fun!” exclaimed Joey.\n\n“Will you go with me to eat the mystical berries now?” asked Joey. \n\nLivie did not answer. Livie was busy preening her feathers as she nibbled along straightening and aligning each feather. \n\nJoey gazed out over the shimmering waters of Florida Bay and mused on the brightness of the day. Joey felt as one with all creatures swimming in the tides, moving on the land and flying in the skies.\n\nJoey felt the rhythms of all of nature flowing through his body and he heard the song of the heart pounding in his head. His mind warmed and flooded with white sunshine and his heart felt a fullness like it was filled with the brightness of joy and if the day would be any brighter, well his heart could just explode. \n\nJoey watched for the return of the EAGLES as the day turned into night and he fell asleep."

The wind buffeted them about, sending them tumbling through the gray mist, but Joey reveled in the thrill of the ride.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Joey settled back into the safety of the nest, content and full after a dinner of freshly caught seafood. He dreamed of the mystical berries and the joy they brought, but Livie was too busy preening her feathers to join him.\n\nJoey felt at one with the world, connected to all creatures great and small.

The torque output of an engine depends on the force applied to the pistons, which is determined by the combustion of fuel in the engine's cylinders. The torque curve of an engine shows how the torque output changes with respect to engine speed.\n\nThere are several reasons why the torque curve of an engine is not linear. One reason is that the amount of fuel that can be burned in the engine's cylinders is limited by the size of the cylinders and the rate at which the fuel can be supplied to the cylinders. As the engine speed increases, the cylinders are required to complete more cycles per unit time, and the fuel supply may not be able to keep up with the increased demand. This can result in a decrease in torque output as the engine speed increases.\n\nAnother reason for the non-linearity of the torque curve is that the efficiency of the engine decreases at higher speeds due to factors such as frictional losses and heat dissipation. As the engine speed increases, these losses become more significant, resulting in a decrease in torque output.\n\nFinally, the torque curve may also be affected by the design of the engine and its components, such as the camshaft and valves, which can affect the amount of fuel that can be burned in the cylinders and the efficiency of the engine at different speeds.\n\nIn summary, the torque curve of an engine is not linear because it is influenced by the limitations on fuel supply, efficiency losses, and the design of the engine and its components."

This includes not just the music, but also sound effects, voiceovers, and any other audio elements that help tell your story.\n9. Cinematography: Use high-quality cinematography to make your video look professional and engaging. This could include creative camera angles, lighting, and composition.\n10. Editing: Pay attention to the pacing and flow of your video. Use editing techniques to create a compelling narrative that holds the viewer's attention.\n11. Branding: Make sure your video aligns with your brand identity.

        "value": "I am going to give you a story. Write the script for a 1980s text adventure game based on it. \n\n Wanderer\nAlex Weinberg\n \nChapter 1\n \nI don't know what was a dream or a hallucination. From time to time, I felt something damp on my body, and saw a light behind my closed eyes, and heard sounds that I couldn't decipher. Sometimes, someone leaned over me and poured something into my mouth, holding the back of my head with their other hand. Sometimes it was something acrid and bitter. Sometimes it was a gluey substance that nearly made me choke and gag, and yet I was too weak to resist. Sometimes someone squeezed a wet cloth into my mouth. I don't know how much time passed. Maybe days, maybe hours. At some point, the sounds became less strange, and the vision started to make sense. And finally, I tried to open my eyes, and tried to look, but my eyelids were stuck shut. I tried to say something, but only strangled moans came out. I did not know where I was, but knew that I was laying on a low bed of some kind, and I was naked except for the coverlet covering my body.\nAnd finally, I felt something wet on my face: something was rubbing at my eyes. A gentle touch. It didn't hurt, and when I lifted my head, the blurry world began to resolve itself into focus.\nThere was a small figure before me - no taller than three feet - with large yellow eyes and pebbled green skin, and a broad, straight slash for a mouth. It wore a hooded garment that looked like some kind of rough fabric, almost like burlap, and an apron with pockets over that. And there was something hanging from its thick woven belt. I couldn't tell what it was.\nThe small being approached me, slowly. Its fingers gently rubbed my face, trying to remove the mucus from my eyes. It opened its froglike mouth for a moment, uttering a single line of chirps and clicks, varying in frequency. Then it stopped, was silent for a moment, and then tried again.\n \nI shook my head, weakly.\n“No,\" I said, weakly, barely able to strangle it out. Other words came to my mind, sounding very different... ah! Another language. I repeated myself in that one, then in what little I knew of another. That flowed a little easier, but the little being seemed at just as much of a loss as it had when I had been speaking Co-... Co-Standard!\nI saw the words \"Co-Standard\" in my mind, along with long strings of words and numbers that I still could not manage to get my head around. My native language was called Co-Standard, I realized. Was that it?\n\"Do... you... Co-...\" I managed, struggling with getting my mouth to form the word-shapes. My throat seized and knotted painfully. \nThe little being made a series of gestures with its hands, and I tried to copy. That, I could manage, somehow, though it kept shaking its head, and I realized that I wasn't mirroring the expression properly.\nIt seemed to understand that well enough, and it repeated the gestures: first, holding up a fist. I shook my head. It pushed its fist into the air, and then, brought its fist down onto its palm. Again. This time, I raised my right arm and made the same gesture. Then my left. I made sure to hold my arms above my head as far as possible, stretching them wide, as if giving myself the widest berth I could muster. The effort made my weak muscles tremble.\nFinally, the little creature sighed in what I could only assume was either exasperation or relief. The glow from the candle near the wall faded slightly, but did not disappear entirely. \nI lowered my arms, but remained still. That small amount of movement left me exhausted. The small thing came closer to me, touching my face, again and again. And then it repeated that gesture again.\nI tried to sit up, but couldn't; the effort left me breathless. And so I lay flat on my back, waiting. Why was I so weak?\n \nI dozed off, with the little creature still moving about the room, and looking over me here and there. After what seemed like hours, I felt a light pressure on my shoulder, and I heard the little frog-creature say something I couldn't understand. \nWhen I was certain that I could see without discomfort, I lifted my head just enough to allow my gaze to follow the small figure standing in front of me. It didn't seem surprised, but simply moved on to another task, shuffling about the room - unless that was how it showed surprise. I blinked a few times. Then, when it returned to my face, I struggled to speak again, my words strangling in my throat.\nThe small being's smile - if its open-mouthed gape could be called that - broadened, and the color of its skin turned slightly paler. The little creature ambled over to my bedside again, with its rolling gait, and reached out and gently ran a finger along my cheekbone, before caressing the corner of my mouth. \"Rrrrrrr?\" it chirped, and it waved its hands and flicked its fingers around as it did so.\nAnd finally, I managed: \"Where... am... I,\" struggling to get my lips and tongue around those words, and finally forcing them out.\nMy brain must've had something left after all. It felt weird to be alive, to have words coming out of my mouth. That didn't feel right. It should be something else. Like I'd spent so long screaming and choking on the nothingness inside me that my throat was still sore from doing it all the time. So the voice came out like an angry gargle, like someone screaming from a great distance, without much power behind it.\nAnd finally, I looked over in the corner, noticing for the first time the items there, sitting on top of some kind of stool: an irreparably damaged space suit (how did I know that) and a space helmet. And on top of the folded suit, lay some items I recognized. A small box... no, it was a radio. Some kind of tool. And a slide rule. I felt some kind of certainty that these were my things, and it was the first time since waking up in this hut that I'd felt any kind of certainty about anything at all. But I couldn't actually get over to the corner to look at those things, I couldn't even get out of bed, I could barely turn over or lift my head. There was some kind of dull throbbing pain going through my entire body, from the soles of my feet to the tips of my fingers. \nAs I sat there looking at those items in the corner, trying to find some sense of self-awareness in this dark world, it started to sink in:\nThe truth hit me like a gut punch. If I could've put together some kind of decent explanation of how it happened, maybe I would've accepted it more easily. Pictures flashed in my brain of a variety of spacecraft experiencing any variety of explosions, catastrophes, crashes through the atmosphere. It seemed like a given that something of the kind had happened to me. If only I could remember. How long had I been here? A week? Two weeks? How had I ended up here? Did it even make any difference? \nNo matter what the answers were, I knew they wouldn't help me now. I didn't know where I was supposed to be, only that it wasn't here, and I had no choice but to stay for the moment. \nWhat did I need to do next? Who could I ask for help, or was this the help? How was I going to get home?\nI wasn't really capable of getting up yet. I didn't know how long that would take. I would have to work on it, and I forced myself to sit up on the low bed, before collapsing back down onto the bed again, breathless. I would have to try a little more each day, as long as my hosts were willing to keep me alive. At least until I was strong enough to leave. \nI began to drift off again, imagining an answer to the question: How? How can I get out of here? What am I going to do? The possibilities swirled through my mind. It seemed obvious. Once I was well enough to get out of bed, I was going to have to get up and get a look at my surroundings.\n. \nDay after day, the somewhat frog-headed people took care of me. I could not discern gender among them or perhaps only one gender was allowed to handle me, so I had not seen the others. And perhaps their gender was something not easily transparent to me. \nAbout ten of them had entered this room, taking turns with each other regarding my care. One of them was someone I took for some kind of medicine-person or doctor type or other person they considered learned, and that one had multiple garlands of strung beads (that looked like different colors of glass) around its neck, with some kind of tight-fitting hood over its head. This healer came in regularly, at every juncture checked on what I assumed its underlings and various visitors, and came to check on my wounds.\nAt one point, two of the healer's apprentices (I assumed, based on their identical dress to the healer) seemed to break out in an argument. \nI watched and watched and tried to make note inside my mind about the level of light in the room - and I realized that for all I knew, I was underground. There was no way to tell the time by the light coming in from outside. But there was a certain regularity to my carers’ movements: they came in a specific order, first the short one, then the fat one (well, fatter than any of these beings, who all seemed on the slim side), then the healer with its staff and its apprentice bearing the tray of bowls and powders.\nI could do nothing but tremble when one of them just barely touched me, as it felt as if its three spindly fingers had sunk into my flesh. The feeling remained after they left, and I was still too weak to move or resist.\nThey varied as individuals, primarily in height (some were taller than others), build (some were stocky and some were thin though none of them could be called fat), and facial markings - some had yellow markings around their eyes and lips, some had a voluminous mass of reddish wrinkles below their throat and others did not. They all had the same uniformly pebbled green skin. They all had the same large saucerlike yellow eyes. \nThey all communicated among themselves with a trilling, chirping language I couldn't even begin to replicate with my throat; sometimes I found my throat making the noise on its own, after them, but I had no idea what I was saying, and they learned to ignore me when I tried to speak their language, and so I figured I would try to remain quiet until I had more sense of my bearings. \nAnd when they attempted to communicate with me, it was either in that trill language or it was by that same gestural format that I recognized as a sign language. I probably had more of a chance of learning that. But somehow I knew that I needed to take my time with that as well. \nI didn't know the customs here. Anything could go wrong. I could continue to speak nonsense (or insults) and they could continue to ignore me, and or... I could keep my mouth shut until I actually had something meaningful to say. I felt amused in the moment because even on some unknown planet, it felt familiar, possibly one of the first things I’d ever learned.\nAnd by then, I'd speak enough for them to actually want to help me learn more. Or they could choose to discard of me or... I knew there were lots of ways this could go, none of them good. \nSo I let them babble and gesture while I thought things through. I figured I just about had no better of a chance of getting my bearings with these total strangers than I did with people like me, wherever I was from, with my two legs, bilateral symmetry, bipedalism, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot. Different from my hosts: with three long fingers on each green matchstick arm.\nI studied the layout of the room again, noting that they had kept my things where I had found them.\nThe only thing I could figure about them was that they must excrete the same way given my aides' familiarity with the basic mechanics of a bedpan. \nThey acted with some confusion presented with another fact about my anatomy, and the discovery that I was bleeding between my legs led their medicine-person or doctor to come to inspect: I took that to assume they'd never met anything that bled for four days and didn't die. I made mental note of that in case it was relevant about their species, but then I realized something just as important.\nSomehow, I knew, and I didn't know how I knew, but it seemed to follow from my starting my monthly while too weak to move, laying on an alien bed:\n \nI must've been unconscious for about a week and a half, making total time laid up here, almost two weeks.\nAll I could do was to learn their routine, get very familiar with it, and steel myself for whatever each was going to attempt upon my person, and try to learn what I could however I could, about each one, and about where I was. \nOn finding that I was a tiny bit stronger now - I could increasingly use the ceramic bedpan without too much additional help - I knew I had to get my strength back, so I tried to move about a bit, even as still confined to the bed: stretching my toes and fingers, lifting my arms and legs, twisting about and letting the blood flow, as if it might flow straight into my muscles and make them stronger. The efforts helped me regain a little bit of energy, and so I would lay back down again and doze off again, my muscles cramping. Little by little, I would get as much of my strength back as I could.\nAt the moment, though, I could look around, look in each corner, and I saw that this small room had one doorway which led out into some kind of a hall, and that the walls seemed to be made of some kind of mud, and the floor of packed dirt, but covered with colorful tapestries. There were small candles - no, oil lamps of some kind - on a low flat rock in the corner, and I smelled something that smelled like... rancid tallow came to mind, but then I realized I didn't even know what that smelled like. And it gave the whole place a certain dimly lighted atmosphere and made the shadows appear so much longer. \nAnd... I felt a sinking feeling in my gut, because looking at the adobe walls, and the packed dirt floor, and the woven tapestries and oil lamps, and my suit and helmet and gloves sitting on a stool in the corner, I knew one thing.\nWherever I was, I might just have to get used to being here. Because looking around, I knew that the chances I was leaving, were probably slim to none.\n \nWherever I was. Wherever I was from. Whoever I was.\nEach day passed very like the last. I could now sit up in bed on my own for large parts of the day, and move about a little bit on my wobbly legs. Though the effort temporarily exhausted me, each day I grew a little stronger than the day before. I kept working on it: moving my arms and legs, taxing my core muscles. Eventually I managed to get onto my knees and push myself forward to standing, supported by the side of the bed. Gradually, over a few days, I built up to sitting in a chair for longer periods. When I began to stand on my own I realized how badly my muscles had wasted away, especially my quadriceps, but it felt so good to feel those old leg muscles twitch under my weight. Between visits by my froglike caregivers, in particular the healer's rounds (which could be timed absolutely to level of light in the room, and I also knew that once the healer had visited, it would not be back for a while), I was left to myself.\nI finally made it over to the stool in the corner, where the spacesuit, helmet, gloves, and the various items - the small radio, the slide rule, and what looked to be a handheld tool - sat, and sitting there before these items, I looked them over.\nLooking at the helmet and suit brought to mind countless images of other helmets and suits, various makes and types: and my hands twitched looking at the gloves. The helmet had the word \"RENBERG\" stamped on it and my mouth formed the letters, and my heartbeat quickened when I realized what I was looking at. And a glint off the faceplate struck me… and there was a woman staring back at me, and I felt a familiar discomfort in my gut on meeting her dark green eyes. Short gold hair, shorter on the sides: it sat limply on my scalp, having not been washed. Earrings - no, they weren’t earrings, they were polished black plugs, about the circumference of my thumb. My face was stern and plain and rawboned, with high sharp cheekbones, a straight slash of a mouth with no smile lines, and most curious of all - the thin line tattoos that ran down the right side of my face and neck, and then on my chin, tattoos that reminded me of feline markings. I felt… I should feel something about these, but nothing came to me, it was as locked behind a wall of gray fuzz inside my brain as the rest of my memories.\nMy fingers reached up, shaking, and traced two vertical dark blue lines down the right side of my face, then down my neck, where they formed a simple geometric pattern that ended at my collarbone. This was recent, and still healing. And then there were the thin vertical lines on my chin (four to be precise: two straight short lines, between two longer curved ones), somewhat faded. Those had been there a while.\nMy heart raced, and I took a deep breath, willing steadiness into myself again. I forced myself to look away from my reflection. \nI looked down at my arms: and for the first time, it clicked. The bands of ink around my wrists, various glyphs and markings on my arms. I knew somehow that every single mark on my body had some kind of meaning. It all seemed significant somehow, but nothing clicked. \nI found myself thinking about my breathing: about the time spent doing nothing but breathing before putting on the suit, then, inside the portable potential tomb of a spacesuit, set against hard vacuum, the shallow breaths intended to conserve oxygen.\nMy mind flashed to the magnetized boots, holding their wearer still while standing on a relay. These memories rushed in upon me like an avalanche of darkening clouds. Whenever walking along the relay, the faint glow of the battery cell within the helmet itself did little to lift the sense of fear, isolation, cold and dark I experienced, when alone, inside the helmet, within the suit.\nAnd the deep fatigue I experienced was amplified, deepened by the memory of solitude and loneliness. And yet it was comforting. Somehow, inside myself, I knew it to be more comforting sometimes to be outside, just me and the unbending laws of physics and hard vacuum, surrounded by the curtain of stars, than to be inside, among the others. Where nothing else mattered but the task at hand, in the unforgiving nothing of space. \nPerhaps I am saying something trite and meaningless. Perhaps it is not for me to say whether such an experience was meaningless or not. It was what it was.\nI ran my hand along the suit's neck ring, and then, rested it on the helmet. I reached to try to lift with both hands. My arms shook. At once I understood the cause of my weakness, my wasted muscles.\nIt was obvious to me. Before I woke up here, I had been in space. Long enough to lose my strength. Without the drugs to help the body withstand lower G over time - wait, that was a thing! On a ship without a centrifugal force based gravity ring - oh! There was another thing I knew about! It somehow seemed wrong that I should find myself here. \nI sat with the memories right on the tip of my mind, the way that a word can be said to be on the tip of your tongue, filing through pictures and wondering which were my memories, still uncertain of what was what.\nI picked up the items: the gloves. Something came to my mind: a painful tenderness in my fingertips, a ghost sensation I could feel in the moment, and pulling a glove off of my hand to find my fingertips raw and bloody, and feeling nothing on it - just the processing of images in my mind of it happening again, again, again. I felt excited, knowing this to be memory. The radio, the slide rule, the tool: I hefted each of these, one and then another, and they had one thing in common. On each of them was a plastic label with embossed, raised writing: \"VAL S. RENBERG.\"\nThe tool had a button, and a metal latch that seemed like it would be some kind of a safety. I understood somehow not to pick it up, unlatch it, and point it at anything. Not in here. It would have to wait.\n \nThere was a final item here, that somehow I had missed in my accounting: a silvery metal ball-chain necklace, with a quarter-inch by quarter-inch... orange metal thing attached to it. It looked like this was some kind of a little container, bisected by a thin seam. I worked my thumbnail into the seam - and the top half of the container detached from the bottom half with a “pop” and slid off, revealing a thin chip of metal inside. It didn't trigger any memories. Obviously it was important or I would not have taken it into space. It would be important to hold onto. I picked it up, and with my arm shaking, slipped it back around my neck.\nI heard footsteps in the hall, and quickly, made it back to the bed, and back under the covers. I was exhausted by this effort, anyway. \nAt least I knew who I was: if these were indeed my things, then chances were high that I was in fact called Val S. Renberg. There were a lot of potential reasons it might not be so, but the possibility that this was actually me, seemed as likely as any of them. \nIt wasn't long before the last ounce of energy left me, and I simply gave in to it. My body shut down. I let it all go. A profound sleep came over me, as if my subconscious could tell I had run out of things to think about.\n\n \\*\\*\nThe dreams were the strangest things. Sometimes I was in a room, with a flickering, buzzing bright light above me. In every dream, it was the same hard chair. I sat in my chair backwards, leaning the front of my body against the back of the chair, my arms crossed in front of me across the top of the chair’s backrest. The questioner - always a human, always the same younger fair-skinned man with ginger hair - told me he wouldn't talk to me until I sat normally. I rearranged myself in the chair, and finally I was there, trying to find a comfortable position, crossing my legs one direction, then the other.\n\"Are you ready to give your deposition now, Syndic Renberg?\" the questioner asked.\n\"What?\" I asked. \"You want to ask me questions?\"\n\"No, this is a deposition,\" he spoke slowly, emphasizing each word. \"That means I am taking your testimony under oath.\"\nIf only I were able to read anything in my dreams, to make out the name on his shiny metal nametag, obscured as it was by shadows and the strange reflections from the flickers of the buzzing light overhead. If only I could recognize the faces of those other people who appeared from time to time. But the images would flicker, the questions would stop, and the dreams would end. Or they would become new, different dreams. And then, I'd start to tell my side of the story again, and the dream would be over. Each time. At no point in my dream did I ever know what I was being questioned about. In some dreams the room was empty and in some it had some built-in filing cabinets and old posters on the wall portraying the various worlds. There were several other humans present in these dreams, sitting behind the desk or typing away on computers, nodding occasionally at my answers. They always seemed bored, like they really weren't interested in hearing my side of the story.\n\nIt was one more of a scattershot, a 52-pick-up of random events recurring in my dreams, sometimes in my tired mind as a reverie, too consistent to not be memories. But unconnected to anything, let alone to each other. As it happened, the last of those dreams had occurred during my captivity, the first after my small froglike hosts had witnessed my return to consciousness. As usual, I awoke drenched in sweat, unable to move. Always there was a sense of dread, of a hollow aching emptiness that stalked me well into the day.\nBut these were not the only dreams I had.\nSometimes I was on some strange world full of domed farming settlements. In some parts of the settlement, where the real work went on, knee-high robots skittered about, sometimes telescoping their bodies to reach the higher branches of the trees they picked. And then after walking down a lone narrow path, I was in a room full of humans, all of them not wearing a single stitch of clothing, and most with colorful swirls and flowers painted on their bodies - paint, not tattoo. They laughed among themselves, and sipped their drinks from their handmade ceramic cups, and freely mingled in this room full of exotic plants and colored lights, and some reclined on large cushions on the floor, in groups ranging from two to four. No doubt the heat and humidity in what amounted to a giant domed greenhouse must have driven them to strip down, to allow themselves a chance to cool off. For some reason, in these dreams, I was always looking at their arms and backs for tattoos, and anxious that I didn't see any, for I could deign no sign of what any of these people did, of their individuality, of their loyalties, their work. Always in this dream I felt the walls closing in on me, I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was trying to get out in a panic but am having to bump against sweaty naked flesh with every inch of progress I make toward the single door. And in the dream I was lost between not wanting any part of their sex party while being insulted that I wasn't invited, and preparing multiple answers in my head about what I'm going to reply if they did actually invite me.\nIn other dreams, I found myself a small child wandering through the dark tunnels beneath my city - but on waking I could never place where that was. It was all twisted corridors, staircases leading nowhere, rooms full of the eerie noises of pipes, steam vents, machinery.In these dreams, I was carrying a thick book full of equations and schematics and blueprints, hurrying down a dark corridor while the city's colorfully lit spires towered above, but I kept my eyes down, avoiding the city's various denizens as I made it to school in the dark. Sometimes I would look up and there would be a huge sign shining down: three proud space travelers with helmets, and what looked to be a symbol I couldn't quite make out, and the thick block letters spelling \"WE’VE GOT THIS.\" This I understood immediately and it was the only thing in any one of my dreams that I could ever read.\nBut always there was one dream, recurring, that was comforting. In this dream I was standing on a catwalk, on what I recognized to be a shipyard in space. The rumbling of the ships leaving dock, always at the same time, always with the same procedure as they launched. In some of these dreams I was young, an older child standing on these walkways. In some I was an adult wearing a flight suit, standing before a panel of switches and dials. In these dreams I always knew where I was: and in this last one, I was at the shipyard near the barren rock called Point Destruction. I knew what I was supposed to do, and replied during headcount, and I knew what part I played in the fifty-person crew that kept a Massive Container Transport flying intersystem.\nBut more, in some of these dreams of working in space, there was a large, tall man - or perhaps it's more fair to say that he was a male. Tall pointed, tufted ears and a whiskered muzzle like a lynx's, a long braided mane meticulously tied back in a topknot. Intelligent golden eyes.\nIn my dreams the sleeves of his flight suit are pushed back to reveal the artfully swirling dark blue tattoos visible through the brown short-trimmed fur on his muscular arms, and his long tail wrapped around a hand-hold to secure himself in microgravity, leaving his hands free. Sometimes I was sitting beside him in a small two-seater in space, listening to him sing in another language... not my native language and nonetheless I understood the words, and sometimes I sang with him.\nAnd when I woke up from this dream, always, I'd try to connect it to something, try to remember something, and... that's that. My memories felt like they were on the tip of my mind the way that a word is said to be on the tip of your tongue.\nI didn't know what I was remembering, but I knew what emotion I felt when I was awake, and it was a profound sense of homesickness, of belonging somewhere. It was when I had these dreams in particular that I would wake with my chest aching with an emotion I couldn’t find a word for, an empty pit inside I couldn’t name, and couldn’t fill.\nAnd always on waking, I’d look over at the space suit and helmet and other things in the corner. The suit was damaged beyond usability; it only took a single examination and a double-check to feel safe concluding that my small froglike hosts had cut me out of it. \n\\*\\*\\*\nMy recovery felt painfully slow. Each day I pushed myself further than the day before. Each day they fed me the same bitter hot drink and the same thick milky gruel five times a day, insisting I take it, and though I tried hard not to gag on it because it had roughly the same consistency and taste as phlegm, I made myself swallow it because for all I knew, no other food was coming. Besides, I was getting stronger. And I was alive. That alone gave me hope.\nMy legs no longer shook after standing on them for five minutes, and each day I'd been able to stand, and walk around, just a bit more. Now - roughly four days into my regaining consciousness in this small room - I was going to find out where I was.\nOver the next few hours, I watched each of my hosts come and go from the room: first the short one, then the fat one, then the tall healer and their assistant. Following the healer's departure, I would be left alone for some hours, and if it were like any other day, then the hall would be clear for a while.\nI silently counted in my mind, backward from 200, after I'd heard the last of the healer's and apprentice's footfalls fade from view, and then I sat up, grabbing the coverlet from the bed and tying it around my body so that it covered my torso, hanging free down to my knees.\nAnd then I stood, stepping from one foot to the other, on the balls of my feet, as lightly as I could manage, and quietly, I grabbed one of the oil-lamps from the floor and I stepped from the room, and assessed my environment. The ceiling being barely a few inches above my head, I ducked my head when I stepped out the door.\nThe walls here were some type of stone, bare of paint or decorations. There were a few other open, arch-shaped doorways like the one I'd come through, but I saw no sign of windows. Was I underground? Most of the rooms were empty, though I heard - a few doors down - the faint chittering and trilling of frog-people talking to each other. It was a comfortable temperature here, just slightly warm. I thought it best to go in the opposite direction of the chittering frog-people down the hall, and as I crept down the hall, I spotted another open doorway immediately to the right of the doorway from which I'd emerged, and what looked to be some kind of cabinet or store room - I stepped just inside the door, holding my oil lamp in any direction I wanted to look in.\nThe place was very clean and tidy, the shelves well-organized, stacked neatly in rows and columns. Handmade ceramic bowls of what looked to be various electronic parts and widgets - wires, bolts, nuts. The shelf beneath held rows of smaller objects, both familiar in form and not: pieces of machinery and gears and wheels that seemed to be the common shape of so many bipedal, bilateral symmetry species' pre-spacefaring industrial technology. But it was what lay behind the rows of neatly stacked objects and arranged ceramic bowls that caught my attention. Pieces of milky crystal, ranging in size from my thumb to the size of my arm. I set my oil-lamp down onto the shelf, and I picked up one of the smaller crystals and held it up to the light, turning it over to look at every aspect of it; it wasn't raw rock crystal but instead somehow machine-tooled. Finally there was a larger bowl sitting on this shelf, and there was an assortment in it that was hearteningly familiar: objects that looked carved from crystal themselves, some from something that resembled obsidian, but were unmistakably tools. Tools of various shapes and sizes, crude implements and even ornate devices made by someone who had seen their work, who cared about making beautiful and functional tools. All these objects looked centuries old. My eyes drifted over the surface of a small object I held in my hand: a fine pointed stone meant to cut things precisely but which, I thought in the moment, could probably be used to pry, or - should I encounter anything resembling a screw - in the place of a flathead screwdriver, though I already had one on my multitool. There was a pair of tarnished metal goggles here, too - the metal resembled brass - with dark lenses. The band was makeshift, made of two strips of braided cloth meant to be tied at the back of the head. Where could these have come from? Did these people grind glass, or...\nI lifted the goggles to my face, and then tied the two straps behind my head, and looked around. The lenses cut the light by half, and were surprisingly lightweight. I lifted them back up to my forehead, and continued to look around. This place had tools! Some scrapers, pliers, knives. And on top of all that, some weird objects I didn't recognize, although they reminded me of a sort of gardening tool, with two tines at the end. Finally, satisfied with what I saw, I turned around, to look at the shelves on the other side of me. But as I did, I startled suddenly as something trilled softly behind me.\nI jumped backwards, stumbling, catching myself before I fell. It was one of the frog-people: the healer's tall, thin apprentice.\n\"Rrrr?\" it trilled again, and within moments, two other of the frog-people emerged behind it.\n\"Shit,\" I said aloud, holding my hands up in front of me. \"Look, don't worry about it.\"\nI remembered the goggles on top of my head, and reached for them, putting them back on the shelf behind me, then turning, holding my hands up. \"Sorry!\" I called out. \"Just curious is all.\"\n\"Rrrr?\" one of the frog-people said, sounding hesitant.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry!\" I exclaimed, \"You must think I'm really rude. You know, exploring places where you're not supposed to...\"\n\"Rrrr.\"\n\"I'll go back to my room.\"\n\"Rrrr.\"\n\"Well, thanks anyway,\" I said, nodding awkwardly, and I backed away from the shelf, holding my hands up. They moved aside to let me pass, then disappeared into the shadows beyond. I breathed a sigh of relief, then looked down the hall I'd just come from, toward the sounds of chatter from the other end. But I thought the better of it, and headed back toward my room. And there, in the middle of the room, the healer stood, holding its staff. I stood still, and the healer looked over me, up and down, and finally, it brought its three-fingered hands to its eyes, and made the shape of goggles. \"Rrr?\"\nI put my hands up to my face, copying the gesture. \"Rrr.\"\nIt held up a hand, then brought its other hand over, making a gesture as if to hold one of the small tools I'd just examined in the storeroom, and it turned the hand as if turning the tool. \"Rr?\"\nI repeated the gesture, imagining the tool in my hand. I had no idea what I was telling them. Just that it seemed natural.\nAnd finally, the healer stood, and said nothing for a long time, but turned toward its assistant and two other frog-people, who stood in the doorway, and chirped at them, and they cleared out of the way as two other frog-people emerged. They were dragging something. I watched, intrigued. The large object made a dragging sound against the floor. It looked like some kind of clumsily assembled mannequin, or...\nI looked closer. It lacked a head, and loose connectors and stiff wires stuck out from its neck, and what's more, was that it appeared to be assembled of mismatched bits, a clear plastic panel here, a metal panel there...\nIt was a robot.\nAnd I sat with this for a moment, while the healer looked at me, then repeated the “tool using” gesture with its hands that I had copied just a moment before.\nI considered all of the information available to me - the various bits and bobs of technology in the storeroom that somehow didn’t fit with the Neolithic conditions in which I was being kept, that didn’t seem to fit any one coherent pattern or aesthetic to indicate a single technological base, and now, there was a broken robot hauled in front of me.\nI glanced over at the spacesuit in the corner, and considered the slide rule (probably a foreign object to them) and the multitool (similar enough to other tools that were in that storeroom) that had been there among my things, and that these people had - I presumed - pulled me from a wrecked vessel. And now - I was sure - I was being kept in an underground facility.\nI felt safe in assuming the frog-people to be scavenging technology, and possibly hiding it.\nMy gut clenched in dread. I had to get to the outside. I had to know where I was. I had to know where I had come from.\nI looked back at the headless robot. “I’m just going to have to try,” I said to no one in particular. \nIt rolled off of my tongue as if I’d said this many, many times before, and the clench in my gut told me that enough of those times, I’d tried and failed, and that the failures mattered gravely. \n\nWANDERER CHAPTER 3\nALEX WEINBERG \nAs soon as they were gone, I turned away from the robot and hurried over to the wall of shelves along the back wall. Several things caught my eye, but not a single thing was anything I recognized. At least the actual raw materials were familiar: random bits of copper and crystal, various rings and washers of some kind of rubberlike material. Not here, nor in the storeroom, had I run into anything resemble the circuit testers I saw pictures of in my mind, as if the memory were there, waiting. This didn't mean they weren't available somewhere, I reminded myself. It only meant that I hadn't found them yet. Or that they didn't look anything like what we had back home… wherever “home” happened to be. I wondered what they looked like, then shook my head to clear it. It didn't matter; what mattered was getting this working again.\n\"I need a manual,\" I muttered, shaking my head. \"Well. Better know what I'm getting myself into.\"\n\nI had no way to judge the time, but estimated that I sat for a few hours, just staring at the robot, even as my bladder ached. I'd examined the thing up and down, looking for some kind of seam, trying to deign some kind of clue as to this contraption's assemblage. Some of it seemed... random. Its arms didn't seem to match - the left had a clear plastic-looking casing wherein you could see the wires and servos inside, and the right was articulated chrome. And in the middle of its chest sat a plate with what I can only presume was a socket into which could be attached a third arm. It didn't look like it went with the rest of the robot. Who was the original maker of this thing? Was it getting salvaged again, again, added onto again and again? What even powered this thing? Why? There was no obvious power source or plug of any kind. No wires coming out anywhere, nothing plugged into the front, none of the obvious stuff. These were all questions I asked myself over and over again, trying to put together the puzzle. Could I reach up, unscrew anything? Was there anything that came apart from anything else? And if I did, what might happen if I opened something that wasn't supposed to be opened? I felt nervous enough already, thinking about how easily this could break, given the wrong circumstances.\n\"Shit,\" I muttered to myself.\nI don't know how long I sat there, just staring at the robot. I know that two helpings of the frog-people's nutri-slime had been placed next to me, spaced some time apart, and that they'd also brought me drinking bowls of hot water. I did manage to get up to relieve myself twice. And then returned to the robot, looking it up and down, detaching this or that limb as I could, and feeling anywhere I could for some kind of a seam.\n\nAnd there it was... something that resembled a plate with a seam. I reached under one side of the plate, digging my short fingernails into the seam, and... there. The plate popped off, landing on the floor at my feet. And under it, was a tangle of wires, obscuring a... row of familiar looking switches. Well, whoever built this thing, clearly thought and built in binary... and thought to build a robot with humanoid arms, humanoid legs. Except binary wasn't even necessarily the norm among all humanoids. I sighed in frustration and exhaustion because the insides were as much of a mismatched hodge-podge as the outsides, and whoev er worked on this thing before, had terrible cable management. A little of this wire here, a bit of that wire there, half buried, almost covered by another wire... like an art project gone awry. This place looked like someone threw everything in the house that would fit in here and set it to a robotic assembler to work on it, until the person finally came back to pick it up. Who knows. I bent down, poking around through the wires, poking and prodding and pushing. After some effort, I found one end of the main wire running out of the torso section of the machine. And with some searching, I located another piece of loose wire going to the base.\nI traced it back to where it would be connected, and... no. The wrong kind of connector. Whatever the other end was supposed to be doing, this was not it. I rubbed my eyes. I was ready to cry from frustration when I walked back to my room, and as soon as I sat down on the mat that passed for a bed, I felt the heaviest weariness sink into my bones, making my body feel heavy. I don't remember leaning back onto the bed and falling asleep, that's how exhausted I was. \\*\\*\n\nMy dreams that night were as strange as any the nights before. In those dreams, I'm with him again, on that little yellow ship. The large feline man who sings in his language every time he pulls the little yellow two-seater out of its berth. First he takes a small bag - some kind of leather, from the looks of it - from the inside of his shirt, and affixes it to the instrument panel. Then he unwinds the bracelet he always wears - a length of braid, like braided hair - and wraps that around the throttle. Pilots and navigators, always such a superstitious lot. But it's what he always does next that fascinates me: each step in his song, goes to a specific pre-flight check. I have to listen closely to follow along. By the time we are in the cockpit again, we're both suited up, and we're underway. The cockpit is silent save for the low humming of the engines, and his soft humming over his helmet's speaker. It's such a simple song, and yet each time, it carries us forward with the utmost precision. Somehow this time I am singing with him. And then it comes into view, Ansible Relay 44's miles of panels. This time, I know the song. I know what every step in this process is, and it's come to give me comfort, too, in its never-changingness. For as far as I can remember, he has sung these steps with the same accuracy. It doesn't matter whether I know them, or whether he chooses to explain them. The meaning behind them remains constant. So it will go. Always forward. I will step out of this little ship, my magnetized boots holding me fast to the relay. And when I return to the little yellow ship, I'll find that my feline companion - his name is Kesh, I think - has been singing this whole time, singing me back. And I will ask him about it. And he will glance away from me, chuckle slightly, and say \"I would only not sing you back if I meant to leave you out on that relay.\"\nAnd somehow, that means something to me, because somehow I know that there haven't been that many people I would trust not to. But I trust him.\nAnd then seemingly all at once, I'm in a small compartment with him, the kind you can get for shared quarters on a Massive Container Transport - somehow in my dreams, I know this. I am laying on the rack beside him, curled against him, my head resting in the crook of his shoulder. He takes my hand, twining my fingers in his, then finally, raising it up to his furry cheek, pressing my hand down the grain of his feline whiskers. There is a deep rumbling in his broad furry chest, and my fingers trace the tabby stripes of his shoulders and face. We stay like that for some time, my head against his fur, the feeling of it beneath my chin warm and comforting. At last, he releases my hand, turning it so that I can lay it on his heart. And it's there I know the feeling for what it is: love. He reaches over, touching the faint lines tattooed on my chin, that resemble his own. My fingers find the braid of hair wound in a bracelet around his wrist - my golden hair braided with the hairs of his darker, courser mane. It has the feel of fine cord. \"R'Kesh,\" I whisper, and he turns to me.\n\nAnd it's just then that the dream ended, and I was awake.\nR'Kesh. The name repeated too often to not be his name. He was the first person I remembered since awakening here, and the feeling in my chest told me who he was. My mate, and he was out there… somewhere. And I was here. Wherever “here” was.\n Wanderer\nAlex Weinberg\n \nChapter 1\n \nI don't know what was a dream or a hallucination. From time to time, I felt something damp on my body, and saw a light behind my closed eyes, and heard sounds that I couldn't decipher. Sometimes, someone leaned over me and poured something into my mouth, holding the back of my head with their other hand. Sometimes it was something acrid and bitter. Sometimes it was a gluey substance that nearly made me choke and gag, and yet I was too weak to resist. Sometimes someone squeezed a wet cloth into my mouth. I don't know how much time passed. Maybe days, maybe hours. At some point, the sounds became less strange, and the vision started to make sense. And finally, I tried to open my eyes, and tried to look, but my eyelids were stuck shut. I tried to say something, but only strangled moans came out. I did not know where I was, but knew that I was laying on a low bed of some kind, and I was naked except for the coverlet covering my body.\nAnd finally, I felt something wet on my face: something was rubbing at my eyes. A gentle touch. It didn't hurt, and when I lifted my head, the blurry world began to resolve itself into focus.\nThere was a small figure before me - no taller than three feet - with large yellow eyes and pebbled green skin, and a broad, straight slash for a mouth. It wore a hooded garment that looked like some kind of rough fabric, almost like burlap, and an apron with pockets over that. And there was something hanging from its thick woven belt. I couldn't tell what it was.\nThe small being approached me, slowly. Its fingers gently rubbed my face, trying to remove the mucus from my eyes. It opened its froglike mouth for a moment, uttering a single line of chirps and clicks, varying in frequency. Then it stopped, was silent for a moment, and then tried again.\n \nI shook my head, weakly.\n“No,\" I said, weakly, barely able to strangle it out. Other words came to my mind, sounding very different... ah! Another language. I repeated myself in that one, then in what little I knew of another. That flowed a little easier, but the little being seemed at just as much of a loss as it had when I had been speaking Co-... Co-Standard!\nI saw the words \"Co-Standard\" in my mind, along with long strings of words and numbers that I still could not manage to get my head around. My native language was called Co-Standard, I realized. Was that it?\n\"Do... you... Co-...\" I managed, struggling with getting my mouth to form the word-shapes. My throat seized and knotted painfully. \nThe little being made a series of gestures with its hands, and I tried to copy. That, I could manage, somehow, though it kept shaking its head, and I realized that I wasn't mirroring the expression properly.\nIt seemed to understand that well enough, and it repeated the gestures: first, holding up a fist. I shook my head. It pushed its fist into the air, and then, brought its fist down onto its palm. Again. This time, I raised my right arm and made the same gesture. Then my left. I made sure to hold my arms above my head as far as possible, stretching them wide, as if giving myself the widest berth I could muster. The effort made my weak muscles tremble.\nFinally, the little creature sighed in what I could only assume was either exasperation or relief. The glow from the candle near the wall faded slightly, but did not disappear entirely. \nI lowered my arms, but remained still. That small amount of movement left me exhausted. The small thing came closer to me, touching my face, again and again. And then it repeated that gesture again.\nI tried to sit up, but couldn't; the effort left me breathless. And so I lay flat on my back, waiting. Why was I so weak?\n \nI dozed off, with the little creature still moving about the room, and looking over me here and there. After what seemed like hours, I felt a light pressure on my shoulder, and I heard the little frog-creature say something I couldn't understand. \nWhen I was certain that I could see without discomfort, I lifted my head just enough to allow my gaze to follow the small figure standing in front of me. It didn't seem surprised, but simply moved on to another task, shuffling about the room - unless that was how it showed surprise. I blinked a few times. Then, when it returned to my face, I struggled to speak again, my words strangling in my throat.\nThe small being's smile - if its open-mouthed gape could be called that - broadened, and the color of its skin turned slightly paler. The little creature ambled over to my bedside again, with its rolling gait, and reached out and gently ran a finger along my cheekbone, before caressing the corner of my mouth. \"Rrrrrrr?\" it chirped, and it waved its hands and flicked its fingers around as it did so.\nAnd finally, I managed: \"Where... am... I,\" struggling to get my lips and tongue around those words, and finally forcing them out.\nMy brain must've had something left after all. It felt weird to be alive, to have words coming out of my mouth. That didn't feel right. It should be something else. Like I'd spent so long screaming and choking on the nothingness inside me that my throat was still sore from doing it all the time. So the voice came out like an angry gargle, like someone screaming from a great distance, without much power behind it.\nAnd finally, I looked over in the corner, noticing for the first time the items there, sitting on top of some kind of stool: an irreparably damaged space suit (how did I know that) and a space helmet. And on top of the folded suit, lay some items I recognized. A small box... no, it was a radio. Some kind of tool. And a slide rule. I felt some kind of certainty that these were my things, and it was the first time since waking up in this hut that I'd felt any kind of certainty about anything at all. But I couldn't actually get over to the corner to look at those things, I couldn't even get out of bed, I could barely turn over or lift my head. There was some kind of dull throbbing pain going through my entire body, from the soles of my feet to the tips of my fingers. \nAs I sat there looking at those items in the corner, trying to find some sense of self-awareness in this dark world, it started to sink in:\nThe truth hit me like a gut punch. If I could've put together some kind of decent explanation of how it happened, maybe I would've accepted it more easily. Pictures flashed in my brain of a variety of spacecraft experiencing any variety of explosions, catastrophes, crashes through the atmosphere. It seemed like a given that something of the kind had happened to me. If only I could remember. How long had I been here? A week? Two weeks? How had I ended up here? Did it even make any difference? \nNo matter what the answers were, I knew they wouldn't help me now. I didn't know where I was supposed to be, only that it wasn't here, and I had no choice but to stay for the moment. \nWhat did I need to do next? Who could I ask for help, or was this the help? How was I going to get home?\nI wasn't really capable of getting up yet. I didn't know how long that would take. I would have to work on it, and I forced myself to sit up on the low bed, before collapsing back down onto the bed again, breathless. I would have to try a little more each day, as long as my hosts were willing to keep me alive. At least until I was strong enough to leave. \nI began to drift off again, imagining an answer to the question: How? How can I get out of here? What am I going to do? The possibilities swirled through my mind. It seemed obvious. Once I was well enough to get out of bed, I was going to have to get up and get a look at my surroundings.\n. \nDay after day, the somewhat frog-headed people took care of me. I could not discern gender among them or perhaps only one gender was allowed to handle me, so I had not seen the others. And perhaps their gender was something not easily transparent to me. \nAbout ten of them had entered this room, taking turns with each other regarding my care. One of them was someone I took for some kind of medicine-person or doctor type or other person they considered learned, and that one had multiple garlands of strung beads (that looked like different colors of glass) around its neck, with some kind of tight-fitting hood over its head. This healer came in regularly, at every juncture checked on what I assumed its underlings and various visitors, and came to check on my wounds.\nAt one point, two of the healer's apprentices (I assumed, based on their identical dress to the healer) seemed to break out in an argument. \nI watched and watched and tried to make note inside my mind about the level of light in the room - and I realized that for all I knew, I was underground. There was no way to tell the time by the light coming in from outside. But there was a certain regularity to my carers’ movements: they came in a specific order, first the short one, then the fat one (well, fatter than any of these beings, who all seemed on the slim side), then the healer with its staff and its apprentice bearing the tray of bowls and powders.\nI could do nothing but tremble when one of them just barely touched me, as it felt as if its three spindly fingers had sunk into my flesh. The feeling remained after they left, and I was still too weak to move or resist.\nThey varied as individuals, primarily in height (some were taller than others), build (some were stocky and some were thin though none of them could be called fat), and facial markings - some had yellow markings around their eyes and lips, some had a voluminous mass of reddish wrinkles below their throat and others did not. They all had the same uniformly pebbled green skin. They all had the same large saucerlike yellow eyes. \nThey all communicated among themselves with a trilling, chirping language I couldn't even begin to replicate with my throat; sometimes I found my throat making the noise on its own, after them, but I had no idea what I was saying, and they learned to ignore me when I tried to speak their language, and so I figured I would try to remain quiet until I had more sense of my bearings. \nAnd when they attempted to communicate with me, it was either in that trill language or it was by that same gestural format that I recognized as a sign language. I probably had more of a chance of learning that. But somehow I knew that I needed to take my time with that as well. \nI didn't know the customs here. Anything could go wrong. I could continue to speak nonsense (or insults) and they could continue to ignore me, and or... I could keep my mouth shut until I actually had something meaningful to say. I felt amused in the moment because even on some unknown planet, it felt familiar, possibly one of the first things I’d ever learned.\nAnd by then, I'd speak enough for them to actually want to help me learn more. Or they could choose to discard of me or... I knew there were lots of ways this could go, none of them good. \nSo I let them babble and gesture while I thought things through. I figured I just about had no better of a chance of getting my bearings with these total strangers than I did with people like me, wherever I was from, with my two legs, bilateral symmetry, bipedalism, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot. Different from my hosts: with three long fingers on each green matchstick arm.\nI studied the layout of the room again, noting that they had kept my things where I had found them.\nThe only thing I could figure about them was that they must excrete the same way given my aides' familiarity with the basic mechanics of a bedpan. \nThey acted with some confusion presented with another fact about my anatomy, and the discovery that I was bleeding between my legs led their medicine-person or doctor to come to inspect: I took that to assume they'd never met anything that bled for four days and didn't die. I made mental note of that in case it was relevant about their species, but then I realized something just as important.\nSomehow, I knew, and I didn't know how I knew, but it seemed to follow from my starting my monthly while too weak to move, laying on an alien bed:\n \nI must've been unconscious for about a week and a half, making total time laid up here, almost two weeks.\nAll I could do was to learn their routine, get very familiar with it, and steel myself for whatever each was going to attempt upon my person, and try to learn what I could however I could, about each one, and about where I was. \nOn finding that I was a tiny bit stronger now - I could increasingly use the ceramic bedpan without too much additional help - I knew I had to get my strength back, so I tried to move about a bit, even as still confined to the bed: stretching my toes and fingers, lifting my arms and legs, twisting about and letting the blood flow, as if it might flow straight into my muscles and make them stronger. The efforts helped me regain a little bit of energy, and so I would lay back down again and doze off again, my muscles cramping. Little by little, I would get as much of my strength back as I could.\nAt the moment, though, I could look around, look in each corner, and I saw that this small room had one doorway which led out into some kind of a hall, and that the walls seemed to be made of some kind of mud, and the floor of packed dirt, but covered with colorful tapestries. There were small candles - no, oil lamps of some kind - on a low flat rock in the corner, and I smelled something that smelled like... rancid tallow came to mind, but then I realized I didn't even know what that smelled like. And it gave the whole place a certain dimly lighted atmosphere and made the shadows appear so much longer. \nAnd... I felt a sinking feeling in my gut, because looking at the adobe walls, and the packed dirt floor, and the woven tapestries and oil lamps, and my suit and helmet and gloves sitting on a stool in the corner, I knew one thing.\nWherever I was, I might just have to get used to being here. Because looking around, I knew that the chances I was leaving, were probably slim to none.\n \nWherever I was. Wherever I was from. Whoever I was.\nEach day passed very like the last. I could now sit up in bed on my own for large parts of the day, and move about a little bit on my wobbly legs. Though the effort temporarily exhausted me, each day I grew a little stronger than the day before. I kept working on it: moving my arms and legs, taxing my core muscles. Eventually I managed to get onto my knees and push myself forward to standing, supported by the side of the bed. Gradually, over a few days, I built up to sitting in a chair for longer periods. When I began to stand on my own I realized how badly my muscles had wasted away, especially my quadriceps, but it felt so good to feel those old leg muscles twitch under my weight. Between visits by my froglike caregivers, in particular the healer's rounds (which could be timed absolutely to level of light in the room, and I also knew that once the healer had visited, it would not be back for a while), I was left to myself.\nI finally made it over to the stool in the corner, where the spacesuit, helmet, gloves, and the various items - the small radio, the slide rule, and what looked to be a handheld tool - sat, and sitting there before these items, I looked them over.\nLooking at the helmet and suit brought to mind countless images of other helmets and suits, various makes and types: and my hands twitched looking at the gloves. The helmet had the word \"RENBERG\" stamped on it and my mouth formed the letters, and my heartbeat quickened when I realized what I was looking at. And a glint off the faceplate struck me… and there was a woman staring back at me, and I felt a familiar discomfort in my gut on meeting her dark green eyes. Short gold hair, shorter on the sides: it sat limply on my scalp, having not been washed. Earrings - no, they weren’t earrings, they were polished black plugs, about the circumference of my thumb. My face was stern and plain and rawboned, with high sharp cheekbones, a straight slash of a mouth with no smile lines, and most curious of all - the thin line tattoos that ran down the right side of my face and neck, and then on my chin, tattoos that reminded me of feline markings. I felt… I should feel something about these, but nothing came to me, it was as locked behind a wall of gray fuzz inside my brain as the rest of my memories.\nMy fingers reached up, shaking, and traced two vertical dark blue lines down the right side of my face, then down my neck, where they formed a simple geometric pattern that ended at my collarbone. This was recent, and still healing. And then there were the thin vertical lines on my chin (four to be precise: two straight short lines, between two longer curved ones), somewhat faded. Those had been there a while.\nMy heart raced, and I took a deep breath, willing steadiness into myself again. I forced myself to look away from my reflection. \nI looked down at my arms: and for the first time, it clicked. The bands of ink around my wrists, various glyphs and markings on my arms. I knew somehow that every single mark on my body had some kind of meaning. It all seemed significant somehow, but nothing clicked. \nI found myself thinking about my breathing: about the time spent doing nothing but breathing before putting on the suit, then, inside the portable potential tomb of a spacesuit, set against hard vacuum, the shallow breaths intended to conserve oxygen.\nMy mind flashed to the magnetized boots, holding their wearer still while standing on a relay. These memories rushed in upon me like an avalanche of darkening clouds. Whenever walking along the relay, the faint glow of the battery cell within the helmet itself did little to lift the sense of fear, isolation, cold and dark I experienced, when alone, inside the helmet, within the suit.\nAnd the deep fatigue I experienced was amplified, deepened by the memory of solitude and loneliness. And yet it was comforting. Somehow, inside myself, I knew it to be more comforting sometimes to be outside, just me and the unbending laws of physics and hard vacuum, surrounded by the curtain of stars, than to be inside, among the others. Where nothing else mattered but the task at hand, in the unforgiving nothing of space. \nPerhaps I am saying something trite and meaningless. Perhaps it is not for me to say whether such an experience was meaningless or not. It was what it was.\nI ran my hand along the suit's neck ring, and then, rested it on the helmet. I reached to try to lift with both hands. My arms shook. At once I understood the cause of my weakness, my wasted muscles.\nIt was obvious to me. Before I woke up here, I had been in space. Long enough to lose my strength. Without the drugs to help the body withstand lower G over time - wait, that was a thing! On a ship without a centrifugal force based gravity ring - oh! There was another thing I knew about! It somehow seemed wrong that I should find myself here. \nI sat with the memories right on the tip of my mind, the way that a word can be said to be on the tip of your tongue, filing through pictures and wondering which were my memories, still uncertain of what was what.\nI picked up the items: the gloves. Something came to my mind: a painful tenderness in my fingertips, a ghost sensation I could feel in the moment, and pulling a glove off of my hand to find my fingertips raw and bloody, and feeling nothing on it - just the processing of images in my mind of it happening again, again, again. I felt excited, knowing this to be memory. The radio, the slide rule, the tool: I hefted each of these, one and then another, and they had one thing in common. On each of them was a plastic label with embossed, raised writing: \"VAL S. RENBERG.\"\nThe tool had a button, and a metal latch that seemed like it would be some kind of a safety. I understood somehow not to pick it up, unlatch it, and point it at anything. Not in here. It would have to wait.\n \nThere was a final item here, that somehow I had missed in my accounting: a silvery metal ball-chain necklace, with a quarter-inch by quarter-inch... orange metal thing attached to it. It looked like this was some kind of a little container, bisected by a thin seam. I worked my thumbnail into the seam - and the top half of the container detached from the bottom half with a “pop” and slid off, revealing a thin chip of metal inside. It didn't trigger any memories. Obviously it was important or I would not have taken it into space. It would be important to hold onto. I picked it up, and with my arm shaking, slipped it back around my neck.\nI heard footsteps in the hall, and quickly, made it back to the bed, and back under the covers. I was exhausted by this effort, anyway. \nAt least I knew who I was: if these were indeed my things, then chances were high that I was in fact called Val S. Renberg. There were a lot of potential reasons it might not be so, but the possibility that this was actually me, seemed as likely as any of them. \nIt wasn't long before the last ounce of energy left me, and I simply gave in to it. My body shut down. I let it all go. A profound sleep came over me, as if my subconscious could tell I had run out of things to think about.\n\n \\*\\*\nThe dreams were the strangest things. Sometimes I was in a room, with a flickering, buzzing bright light above me. In every dream, it was the same hard chair. I sat in my chair backwards, leaning the front of my body against the back of the chair, my arms crossed in front of me across the top of the chair’s backrest. The questioner - always a human, always the same younger fair-skinned man with ginger hair - told me he wouldn't talk to me until I sat normally. I rearranged myself in the chair, and finally I was there, trying to find a comfortable position, crossing my legs one direction, then the other.\n\"Are you ready to give your deposition now, Syndic Renberg?\" the questioner asked.\n\"What?\" I asked. \"You want to ask me questions?\"\n\"No, this is a deposition,\" he spoke slowly, emphasizing each word. \"That means I am taking your testimony under oath.\"\nIf only I were able to read anything in my dreams, to make out the name on his shiny metal nametag, obscured as it was by shadows and the strange reflections from the flickers of the buzzing light overhead. If only I could recognize the faces of those other people who appeared from time to time. But the images would flicker, the questions would stop, and the dreams would end. Or they would become new, different dreams. And then, I'd start to tell my side of the story again, and the dream would be over. Each time. At no point in my dream did I ever know what I was being questioned about. In some dreams the room was empty and in some it had some built-in filing cabinets and old posters on the wall portraying the various worlds. There were several other humans present in these dreams, sitting behind the desk or typing away on computers, nodding occasionally at my answers. They always seemed bored, like they really weren't interested in hearing my side of the story.\n\nIt was one more of a scattershot, a 52-pick-up of random events recurring in my dreams, sometimes in my tired mind as a reverie, too consistent to not be memories. But unconnected to anything, let alone to each other. As it happened, the last of those dreams had occurred during my captivity, the first after my small froglike hosts had witnessed my return to consciousness. As usual, I awoke drenched in sweat, unable to move. Always there was a sense of dread, of a hollow aching emptiness that stalked me well into the day.\nBut these were not the only dreams I had.\nSometimes I was on some strange world full of domed farming settlements. In some parts of the settlement, where the real work went on, knee-high robots skittered about, sometimes telescoping their bodies to reach the higher branches of the trees they picked. And then after walking down a lone narrow path, I was in a room full of humans, all of them not wearing a single stitch of clothing, and most with colorful swirls and flowers painted on their bodies - paint, not tattoo. They laughed among themselves, and sipped their drinks from their handmade ceramic cups, and freely mingled in this room full of exotic plants and colored lights, and some reclined on large cushions on the floor, in groups ranging from two to four. No doubt the heat and humidity in what amounted to a giant domed greenhouse must have driven them to strip down, to allow themselves a chance to cool off. For some reason, in these dreams, I was always looking at their arms and backs for tattoos, and anxious that I didn't see any, for I could deign no sign of what any of these people did, of their individuality, of their loyalties, their work. Always in this dream I felt the walls closing in on me, I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was trying to get out in a panic but am having to bump against sweaty naked flesh with every inch of progress I make toward the single door. And in the dream I was lost between not wanting any part of their sex party while being insulted that I wasn't invited, and preparing multiple answers in my head about what I'm going to reply if they did actually invite me.\nIn other dreams, I found myself a small child wandering through the dark tunnels beneath my city - but on waking I could never place where that was. It was all twisted corridors, staircases leading nowhere, rooms full of the eerie noises of pipes, steam vents, machinery.In these dreams, I was carrying a thick book full of equations and schematics and blueprints, hurrying down a dark corridor while the city's colorfully lit spires towered above, but I kept my eyes down, avoiding the city's various denizens as I made it to school in the dark. Sometimes I would look up and there would be a huge sign shining down: three proud space travelers with helmets, and what looked to be a symbol I couldn't quite make out, and the thick block letters spelling \"WE’VE GOT THIS.\" This I understood immediately and it was the only thing in any one of my dreams that I could ever read.\nBut always there was one dream, recurring, that was comforting. In this dream I was standing on a catwalk, on what I recognized to be a shipyard in space. The rumbling of the ships leaving dock, always at the same time, always with the same procedure as they launched. In some of these dreams I was young, an older child standing on these walkways. In some I was an adult wearing a flight suit, standing before a panel of switches and dials. In these dreams I always knew where I was: and in this last one, I was at the shipyard near the barren rock called Point Destruction. I knew what I was supposed to do, and replied during headcount, and I knew what part I played in the fifty-person crew that kept a Massive Container Transport flying intersystem.\nBut more, in some of these dreams of working in space, there was a large, tall man - or perhaps it's more fair to say that he was a male. Tall pointed, tufted ears and a whiskered muzzle like a lynx's, a long braided mane meticulously tied back in a topknot. Intelligent golden eyes.\nIn my dreams the sleeves of his flight suit are pushed back to reveal the artfully swirling dark blue tattoos visible through the brown short-trimmed fur on his muscular arms, and his long tail wrapped around a hand-hold to secure himself in microgravity, leaving his hands free. Sometimes I was sitting beside him in a small two-seater in space, listening to him sing in another language... not my native language and nonetheless I understood the words, and sometimes I sang with him.\nAnd when I woke up from this dream, always, I'd try to connect it to something, try to remember something, and... that's that. My memories felt like they were on the tip of my mind the way that a word is said to be on the tip of your tongue.\nI didn't know what I was remembering, but I knew what emotion I felt when I was awake, and it was a profound sense of homesickness, of belonging somewhere. It was when I had these dreams in particular that I would wake with my chest aching with an emotion I couldn’t find a word for, an empty pit inside I couldn’t name, and couldn’t fill.\nAnd always on waking, I’d look over at the space suit and helmet and other things in the corner. The suit was damaged beyond usability; it only took a single examination and a double-check to feel safe concluding that my small froglike hosts had cut me out of it. \n\\*\\*\\*\nMy recovery felt painfully slow. Each day I pushed myself further than the day before. Each day they fed me the same bitter hot drink and the same thick milky gruel five times a day, insisting I take it, and though I tried hard not to gag on it because it had roughly the same consistency and taste as phlegm, I made myself swallow it because for all I knew, no other food was coming. Besides, I was getting stronger. And I was alive. That alone gave me hope.\nMy legs no longer shook after standing on them for five minutes, and each day I'd been able to stand, and walk around, just a bit more. Now - roughly four days into my regaining consciousness in this small room - I was going to find out where I was.\nOver the next few hours, I watched each of my hosts come and go from the room: first the short one, then the fat one, then the tall healer and their assistant. Following the healer's departure, I would be left alone for some hours, and if it were like any other day, then the hall would be clear for a while.\nI silently counted in my mind, backward from 200, after I'd heard the last of the healer's and apprentice's footfalls fade from view, and then I sat up, grabbing the coverlet from the bed and tying it around my body so that it covered my torso, hanging free down to my knees.\nAnd then I stood, stepping from one foot to the other, on the balls of my feet, as lightly as I could manage, and quietly, I grabbed one of the oil-lamps from the floor and I stepped from the room, and assessed my environment. The ceiling being barely a few inches above my head, I ducked my head when I stepped out the door.\nThe walls here were some type of stone, bare of paint or decorations. There were a few other open, arch-shaped doorways like the one I'd come through, but I saw no sign of windows. Was I underground? Most of the rooms were empty, though I heard - a few doors down - the faint chittering and trilling of frog-people talking to each other. It was a comfortable temperature here, just slightly warm. I thought it best to go in the opposite direction of the chittering frog-people down the hall, and as I crept down the hall, I spotted another open doorway immediately to the right of the doorway from which I'd emerged, and what looked to be some kind of cabinet or store room - I stepped just inside the door, holding my oil lamp in any direction I wanted to look in.\nThe place was very clean and tidy, the shelves well-organized, stacked neatly in rows and columns. Handmade ceramic bowls of what looked to be various electronic parts and widgets - wires, bolts, nuts. The shelf beneath held rows of smaller objects, both familiar in form and not: pieces of machinery and gears and wheels that seemed to be the common shape of so many bipedal, bilateral symmetry species' pre-spacefaring industrial technology. But it was what lay behind the rows of neatly stacked objects and arranged ceramic bowls that caught my attention. Pieces of milky crystal, ranging in size from my thumb to the size of my arm. I set my oil-lamp down onto the shelf, and I picked up one of the smaller crystals and held it up to the light, turning it over to look at every aspect of it; it wasn't raw rock crystal but instead somehow machine-tooled. Finally there was a larger bowl sitting on this shelf, and there was an assortment in it that was hearteningly familiar: objects that looked carved from crystal themselves, some from something that resembled obsidian, but were unmistakably tools. Tools of various shapes and sizes, crude implements and even ornate devices made by someone who had seen their work, who cared about making beautiful and functional tools. All these objects looked centuries old. My eyes drifted over the surface of a small object I held in my hand: a fine pointed stone meant to cut things precisely but which, I thought in the moment, could probably be used to pry, or - should I encounter anything resembling a screw - in the place of a flathead screwdriver, though I already had one on my multitool. There was a pair of tarnished metal goggles here, too - the metal resembled brass - with dark lenses. The band was makeshift, made of two strips of braided cloth meant to be tied at the back of the head. Where could these have come from? Did these people grind glass, or...\nI lifted the goggles to my face, and then tied the two straps behind my head, and looked around. The lenses cut the light by half, and were surprisingly lightweight. I lifted them back up to my forehead, and continued to look around. This place had tools! Some scrapers, pliers, knives. And on top of all that, some weird objects I didn't recognize, although they reminded me of a sort of gardening tool, with two tines at the end. Finally, satisfied with what I saw, I turned around, to look at the shelves on the other side of me. But as I did, I startled suddenly as something trilled softly behind me.\nI jumped backwards, stumbling, catching myself before I fell. It was one of the frog-people: the healer's tall, thin apprentice.\n\"Rrrr?\" it trilled again, and within moments, two other of the frog-people emerged behind it.\n\"Shit,\" I said aloud, holding my hands up in front of me. \"Look, don't worry about it.\"\nI remembered the goggles on top of my head, and reached for them, putting them back on the shelf behind me, then turning, holding my hands up. \"Sorry!\" I called out. \"Just curious is all.\"\n\"Rrrr?\" one of the frog-people said, sounding hesitant.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry!\" I exclaimed, \"You must think I'm really rude. You know, exploring places where you're not supposed to...\"\n\"Rrrr.\"\n\"I'll go back to my room.\"\n\"Rrrr.\"\n\"Well, thanks anyway,\" I said, nodding awkwardly, and I backed away from the shelf, holding my hands up. They moved aside to let me pass, then disappeared into the shadows beyond. I breathed a sigh of relief, then looked down the hall I'd just come from, toward the sounds of chatter from the other end. But I thought the better of it, and headed back toward my room. And there, in the middle of the room, the healer stood, holding its staff. I stood still, and the healer looked over me, up and down, and finally, it brought its three-fingered hands to its eyes, and made the shape of goggles. \"Rrr?\"\nI put my hands up to my face, copying the gesture. \"Rrr.\"\nIt held up a hand, then brought its other hand over, making a gesture as if to hold one of the small tools I'd just examined in the storeroom, and it turned the hand as if turning the tool. \"Rr?\"\nI repeated the gesture, imagining the tool in my hand. I had no idea what I was telling them. Just that it seemed natural.\nAnd finally, the healer stood, and said nothing for a long time, but turned toward its assistant and two other frog-people, who stood in the doorway, and chirped at them, and they cleared out of the way as two other frog-people emerged. They were dragging something. I watched, intrigued. The large object made a dragging sound against the floor. It looked like some kind of clumsily assembled mannequin, or...\nI looked closer. It lacked a head, and loose connectors and stiff wires stuck out from its neck, and what's more, was that it appeared to be assembled of mismatched bits, a clear plastic panel here, a metal panel there...\nIt was a robot.\nAnd I sat with this for a moment, while the healer looked at me, then repeated the “tool using” gesture with its hands that I had copied just a moment before.\nI considered all of the information available to me - the various bits and bobs of technology in the storeroom that somehow didn’t fit with the Neolithic conditions in which I was being kept, that didn’t seem to fit any one coherent pattern or aesthetic to indicate a single technological base, and now, there was a broken robot hauled in front of me.\nI glanced over at the spacesuit in the corner, and considered the slide rule (probably a foreign object to them) and the multitool (similar enough to other tools that were in that storeroom) that had been there among my things, and that these people had - I presumed - pulled me from a wrecked vessel. And now - I was sure - I was being kept in an underground facility.\nI felt safe in assuming the frog-people to be scavenging technology, and possibly hiding it.\nMy gut clenched in dread. I had to get to the outside. I had to know where I was. I had to know where I had come from.\nI looked back at the headless robot. “I’m just going to have to try,” I said to no one in particular. \nIt rolled off of my tongue as if I’d said this many, many times before, and the clench in my gut told me that enough of those times, I’d tried and failed, and that the failures mattered gravely. \n\nWANDERER CHAPTER 3\nALEX WEINBERG \nAs soon as they were gone, I turned away from the robot and hurried over to the wall of shelves along the back wall. Several things caught my eye, but not a single thing was anything I recognized. At least the actual raw materials were familiar: random bits of copper and crystal, various rings and washers of some kind of rubberlike material. Not here, nor in the storeroom, had I run into anything resemble the circuit testers I saw pictures of in my mind, as if the memory were there, waiting. This didn't mean they weren't available somewhere, I reminded myself. It only meant that I hadn't found them yet. Or that they didn't look anything like what we had back home… wherever “home” happened to be. I wondered what they looked like, then shook my head to clear it. It didn't matter; what mattered was getting this working again.\n\"I need a manual,\" I muttered, shaking my head. \"Well. Better know what I'm getting myself into.\"\n\nI had no way to judge the time, but estimated that I sat for a few hours, just staring at the robot, even as my bladder ached. I'd examined the thing up and down, looking for some kind of seam, trying to deign some kind of clue as to this contraption's assemblage. Some of it seemed... random. Its arms didn't seem to match - the left had a clear plastic-looking casing wherein you could see the wires and servos inside, and the right was articulated chrome. And in the middle of its chest sat a plate with what I can only presume was a socket into which could be attached a third arm. It didn't look like it went with the rest of the robot. Who was the original maker of this thing? Was it getting salvaged again, again, added onto again and again? What even powered this thing? Why? There was no obvious power source or plug of any kind. No wires coming out anywhere, nothing plugged into the front, none of the obvious stuff. These were all questions I asked myself over and over again, trying to put together the puzzle. Could I reach up, unscrew anything? Was there anything that came apart from anything else? And if I did, what might happen if I opened something that wasn't supposed to be opened? I felt nervous enough already, thinking about how easily this could break, given the wrong circumstances.\n\"Shit,\" I muttered to myself.\nI don't know how long I sat there, just staring at the robot. I know that two helpings of the frog-people's nutri-slime had been placed next to me, spaced some time apart, and that they'd also brought me drinking bowls of hot water. I did manage to get up to relieve myself twice. And then returned to the robot, looking it up and down, detaching this or that limb as I could, and feeling anywhere I could for some kind of a seam.\n\nAnd there it was... something that resembled a plate with a seam. I reached under one side of the plate, digging my short fingernails into the seam, and... there. The plate popped off, landing on the floor at my feet. And under it, was a tangle of wires, obscuring a... row of familiar looking switches. Well, whoever built this thing, clearly thought and built in binary... and thought to build a robot with humanoid arms, humanoid legs. Except binary wasn't even necessarily the norm among all humanoids. I sighed in frustration and exhaustion because the insides were as much of a mismatched hodge-podge as the outsides, and whoev er worked on this thing before, had terrible cable management. A little of this wire here, a bit of that wire there, half buried, almost covered by another wire... like an art project gone awry. This place looked like someone threw everything in the house that would fit in here and set it to a robotic assembler to work on it, until the person finally came back to pick it up. Who knows. I bent down, poking around through the wires, poking and prodding and pushing. After some effort, I found one end of the main wire running out of the torso section of the machine. And with some searching, I located another piece of loose wire going to the base.\nI traced it back to where it would be connected, and... no. The wrong kind of connector. Whatever the other end was supposed to be doing, this was not it. I rubbed my eyes. I was ready to cry from frustration when I walked back to my room, and as soon as I sat down on the mat that passed for a bed, I felt the heaviest weariness sink into my bones, making my body feel heavy. I don't remember leaning back onto the bed and falling asleep, that's how exhausted I was. \\*\\*\n\nMy dreams that night were as strange as any the nights before. In those dreams, I'm with him again, on that little yellow ship. The large feline man who sings in his language every time he pulls the little yellow two-seater out of its berth. First he takes a small bag - some kind of leather, from the looks of it - from the inside of his shirt, and affixes it to the instrument panel. Then he unwinds the bracelet he always wears - a length of braid, like braided hair - and wraps that around the throttle. Pilots and navigators, always such a superstitious lot. But it's what he always does next that fascinates me: each step in his song, goes to a specific pre-flight check. I have to listen closely to follow along. By the time we are in the cockpit again, we're both suited up, and we're underway. The cockpit is silent save for the low humming of the engines, and his soft humming over his helmet's speaker. It's such a simple song, and yet each time, it carries us forward with the utmost precision. Somehow this time I am singing with him. And then it comes into view, Ansible Relay 44's miles of panels. This time, I know the song. I know what every step in this process is, and it's come to give me comfort, too, in its never-changingness. For as far as I can remember, he has sung these steps with the same accuracy. It doesn't matter whether I know them, or whether he chooses to explain them. The meaning behind them remains constant. So it will go. Always forward. I will step out of this little ship, my magnetized boots holding me fast to the relay. And when I return to the little yellow ship, I'll find that my feline companion - his name is Kesh, I think - has been singing this whole time, singing me back. And I will ask him about it. And he will glance away from me, chuckle slightly, and say \"I would only not sing you back if I meant to leave you out on that relay.\"\nAnd somehow, that means something to me, because somehow I know that there haven't been that many people I would trust not to. But I trust him.\nAnd then seemingly all at once, I'm in a small compartment with him, the kind you can get for shared quarters on a Massive Container Transport - somehow in my dreams, I know this. I am laying on the rack beside him, curled against him, my head resting in the crook of his shoulder. He takes my hand, twining my fingers in his, then finally, raising it up to his furry cheek, pressing my hand down the grain of his feline whiskers. There is a deep rumbling in his broad furry chest, and my fingers trace the tabby stripes of his shoulders and face. We stay like that for some time, my head against his fur, the feeling of it beneath my chin warm and comforting. At last, he releases my hand, turning it so that I can lay it on his heart. And it's there I know the feeling for what it is: love. He reaches over, touching the faint lines tattooed on my chin, that resemble his own. My fingers find the braid of hair wound in a bracelet around his wrist - my golden hair braided with the hairs of his darker, courser mane. It has the feel of fine cord. \"R'Kesh,\" I whisper, and he turns to me.\n\nAnd it's just then that the dream ended, and I was awake.\nR'Kesh. The name repeated too often to not be his name. He was the first person I remembered since awakening here, and the feeling in my chest told me who he was. My mate, and he was out there… somewhere. And I was here. Wherever “here” was."

        "value": "Bilateral technology agreements are relatively simple: Only a handful of countries matter in technology development, and the American goal should be only to limit transfer to China. America’s partners will be activated by their own national-security concerns, as well as worry over China’s record of copying technology, then driving out the original developers. But some of them will also have to free themselves from entrenched dependence on China, which will require time and consistent American policy to overcome.\n\nAgreements covering particular industrial sectors can be useful, involving not only tech but others, such as pharmaceuticals, as well. The approach involves strictly enforcing limits on Chinese participation in a supply chain serving the U.S. This same enforcement creates opportunities for firms to make gains in the American market as the subsidized Chinese competition is blocked. Some partners, with their own concerns about Chinese participation in supply chains, may not need much incentive.\n\nAn administration and Congress—both motivated by unfair Chinese competition—should be able to agree on pursuing such negotiations under the Trade Promotion Authority, through which Congress gives the president negotiation instructions in exchange for an up-or-down vote on any deal. If this occurs, the next step is to make the case to partners to partly replace the role played by China’s large labor force; South Asian and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines are well positioned to benefit.\n\nHow far and fast Xi’s new economic strategy will go is debatable, but some signs of coercive economics are already apparent. In 2017, China blocked consumer products, travel, and cultural trade with South Korea because it deployed a U.S. anti-missile system (aimed at North Korea). In 2020, Beijing restricted trade with Australia as punishment for Canberra’s desire to investigate COVID-19’s origins. In late 2021, China began boycotting Lithuanian goods in response to the Baltic nation’s establishing closer diplomatic ties with Taiwan. If unchallenged, China’s bid on supply chains will further shift patterns of production and trade in its favor.\n\nChina is creating more enterprises like Huawei in semiconductors, biotechnology, and other industries. At some point, if Washington does something Beijing dislikes, China may simply stop the supply of crucial goods in these sectors. The nature of China’s economic challenge has changed. America must adapt to meet it.\nTLDR;"

Like, what kind of BS is that? You need to look up how to be real? Come on, son, that's like telling someone to look up how to breathe. Either you're doing it or you're not.\n\nBeing authentic means being true to yourself, being real, being genuine. It means not pretending to be something you're not just to impress others. It means not putting on a front or a mask to hide who you really are.\n\nBut you see, some people don't understand that. They think that being authentic means copying someone else's style, or trying to be like someone they admire. They think that if they dress a certain way, or use certain slang, or listen to certain music, then they're being authentic. But that's just being a poser, man.\n\nYou can't fake authenticity, you either have it or you don't. And if you have to tell someone to \"look up\" what it means to be authentic, then you probably don't have it.\n\nSo, to all those people out there telling their friends to look up authenticity, let me give you some advice. Instead of trying to be something you're not, just be yourself. Embrace your quirks, your flaws, your weirdness. Because that's what makes you unique, that's what makes you special. And if people can't accept you for who you are, then they're not worth your time.\n\nIn conclusion, being authentic is like breathing, you either do it or you don't. And if you have to look it up, then you might as well look up how to be a human being. Peace out."

        "value": "A promise in Node.js is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and manageable way than using callbacks.\n\nHere's an example of using a promise to read a file from the filesystem:\n```\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst readFile = fileName => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (err, data) => {\n      if (err) {\n        reject(err);\n      } else {\n        resolve(data);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n};\n\nreadFile('example.txt')\n  .then(data => {\n    console.log(data);\n  })\n  .catch(err => {\n    console.error(err);\n  });\n```\nIn this example, `readFile()` returns a new promise that wraps the `fs.readFile()` function. The promise is resolved with the contents of the file if the read is successful, or rejected with an error if it fails. The `then()` and `catch()` methods are used to handle the resolved value or rejected reason, respectively.\n\nAnother example:\n```\nconst getUser = id => {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            if (id === 1) {\n                resolve({id: 1, name: 'User 1'});\n            } else {\n                reject(new Error('User not found'));\n            }\n        }, 1000);\n    });\n};\n\ngetUser(1)\n    .then(user => {\n        console.log(user);\n    })\n    .catch(err => {\n        console.error(err);\n    });\n```\nIn this example, `getUser()` returns a new promise that wraps a setTimeout, that simulates a delay in a database query. The promise is resolved with user object if the user is found, or rejected with an error if not found."

        "value": "\"Lose Weight Quickly with a Low-Carb Diet Plan: Your Ultimate Guide\"\n\nMeta Description: Want to lose weight quickly? Follow a low-carb diet plan! In this guide, learn the benefits of a low-carb diet and how to incorporate it into your lifestyle for fast weight loss results.\n\nIntroduction:\nLosing weight can be a difficult and frustrating process, but with the right approach, it doesn't have to be. One effective way to lose weight quickly is by following a low-carb diet plan. By cutting down on carbs, you can reduce your calorie intake and trigger your body to burn stored fat for energy, leading to rapid weight loss.\n\nIn this guide, we'll discuss the benefits of a low-carb diet, how to start one, and what to expect as you progress. By the end, you'll have all the information you need to lose weight quickly and effectively with a low-carb diet plan.\n\n\"What is a Low-Carb Diet?\"\nA low-carb diet is a type of diet that restricts the consumption of carbohydrates, such as sugar, bread, pasta, and rice. Instead, you focus on eating protein-rich foods, healthy fats, and vegetables. By limiting your carb intake, your body is forced to switch from using glucose (carbohydrates) as its primary energy source to using stored fat for energy.\n\n\"Why a Low-Carb Diet is Effective for Weight Loss\"\nThere are several reasons why a low-carb diet is effective for weight loss.\n\n1. Reduces Calorie Intake: By cutting down on carbohydrates, you automatically reduce your calorie intake, leading to weight loss.\n2. Triggers Fat Burning: When your body runs out of carbohydrates to use as energy, it begins to burn stored fat for energy instead.\n3. Reduces Appetite: Low-carb diets have been shown to reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, making it easier to stick to a diet and avoid overeating.\n\n\"How to Start a Low-Carb Diet Plan\"\nStarting a low-carb diet plan can be easy if you follow these steps:\n\n1. Plan Your Meals: Make a list of low-carb meals and snacks that you enjoy and that fit your lifestyle.\n2. Stock Your Kitchen: Get rid of high-carb foods and stock up on low-carb ingredients, such as vegetables, protein-rich foods, and healthy fats.\n3. Count Your Carbs: Keep track of the number of carbohydrates you're consuming each day and make sure to stay within your daily limit.\n4. Be Prepared: Pack low-carb snacks for when you're on-the-go and have low-carb options available for when you eat out.\n\n\"What to Expect When Following a Low-Carb Diet Plan\"\nWhen following a low-carb diet plan, you can expect:\n\n1. Rapid Weight Loss: You can expect to lose weight quickly, especially in the first few weeks, as your body switches from using glucose to using stored fat for energy.\n2. Energy Boost: As your body becomes more efficient at using fat for energy, you may experience increased energy levels.\n3. Increased Satiety: Low-carb diets have been shown to reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, making it easier to stick to a diet and avoid overeating.\n4. Possible Side Effects: Some people may experience side effects, such as headaches, fatigue, and constipation, when starting a low-carb diet. These side effects are usually temporary and can be managed with proper hydration and nutrient supplementation.\n\n\""

        "value": "A seminar on \"From axioms to synthetic inference rules via focusing\" is likely to cover topics related to logic, proof theory, and formal systems. The title suggests that the seminar will explore the process of deriving synthetic inference rules from axioms using a focusing approach. You can expect the seminar to cover the following topics:\n\n1. Axioms: The seminar will likely start with an introduction to axioms, which are the foundational principles or statements in a formal system that are assumed to be true without proof. Axioms serve as the basis for deriving other truths within the system.\n2. Inference rules: Inference rules are the processes or methods used to derive new statements (theorems or conclusions) from given statements (premises). The seminar will discuss various inference rules, such as modus ponens, modus tollens, and hypothetical syllogism.\n3. Synthetic inference rules: Unlike analytic inference rules, which are based on the logical structure of the statements involved, synthetic inference rules are based on the content of the statements. The seminar will explore the concept of synthetic inference rules and how they differ from analytic ones.\n4. Focusing: Focusing is a technique used in proof theory and formal systems to streamline the process of deriving conclusions from premises by organizing and structuring the application of inference rules. The seminar will delve into the concept of focusing and how it can be used to derive synthetic inference rules from axioms.\n5. Examples and applications: The seminar may include examples of formal systems that utilize focusing to derive synthetic inference rules, as well as real-world applications of these techniques. This could involve discussing how the focusing approach has been applied to areas such as automated theorem proving, programming languages, and artificial intelligence.\n6. Related techniques and future research: The seminar may also cover related techniques and approaches in proof theory and formal systems, as well as discuss potential future developments and research directions in the field.\n\nDuring the seminar, you can expect to hear presentations from experts in the field, engage in discussions, and have opportunities to ask questions and seek clarifications on the topics being presented."

Indeed, the general problem of extending standard proof-\ntheoretical results obtained for pure logic to certain classes of non-logical axioms\n\nhas been the focus of attention for quite some time now.\nThe main obstacle for this agenda is that adding non-logical axioms to systems\nwhile still maintaining the good proof theoretical properties is not an easy task. In\nfact, adding naively axioms to sequent systems often result in non cut-free\nsystems. One way of circumventing this problem is by treating axioms as theories,\nadded to the sequent context. This is already in Gentzen's consistency proof of\nelementary arithmetic. Now the derivations have only logical axioms as premises,\nand cut elimination applies.\nBut we can do better by transforming axioms into inference rules. In this talk, we\nwill propose a systematic way of adding inference rules to sequent systems. The\nproposal will be based on the notions of focusing and polarities. We will also\ndiscuss how our framework escalates to hypersequents and systems of rules.\nThis is a joint work with Dale Miller, Sonia Marin and Marco Volpe."

Here are a few possibilities that could cause the LED in the current detector circuit to burn out:\n\n1. Overvoltage: When both circuits are connected to the same power supply, the combined load might cause the voltage to rise, leading to overvoltage in the current detector circuit. Make sure your power supply can handle the combined current draw of both circuits without causing a significant change in output voltage.\n2. Incorrect wiring: Double-check your connections when combining the circuits to ensure that you aren't inadvertently connecting the LED in the current detector circuit to a higher voltage than intended. For example, make sure you're not connecting the LED directly to the power supply voltage without a current-limiting resistor in series.\n3. Grounding issue: If the ground connection is shared between the two circuits, make sure it is stable and can handle the combined current flow. A poor ground connection can cause unexpected voltage drops or rises, which could lead to the LED burning out.\n4. Incompatible components: Ensure that the LED in the current detector circuit is compatible with the voltage and current levels when both circuits are connected. If necessary, replace the LED with one that has a higher voltage or current rating, or add a current-limiting resistor in series with the LED to protect it from excessive current.\n\nTo prevent the LED from burning out, double-check your connections, verify your power supply can handle the combined load, and ensure your components are compatible. If you still have issues, consider using a separate power supply for each circuit or using an isolation circuit, like an optocoupler, to separate the two circuits electrically while still allowing them to interact."

The next player could then roll a d12 and say that they encounter a group of 12 goblins along the way.

It's about making hard decisions and taking responsibility for the well-being of your people.

It looks like the `u_inverseModelTransform` and `u_modelTransform` variables are undeclared. You'll need to declare them as `uniform` at the beginning of the shader code, like this:\n```cpp\nuniform float4x4 u_modelTransform;\nuniform float4x4 u_inverseModelTransform;\n```\nAfter making these changes, your shader code should compile without errors.

I want the SceneView to take up the whole screen with the black hole centered for the camera. I also want to simulate the gravitationally lensed rings. Let's first flatten out the ring we are currently using, and make it slightly thinner, and then stack duplicates of itself so that it appears to be a disc of moving rings. Then, we can add spinning rings around the black hole's edges itself, except these rings will appear as a flat spinning disc perpendicular to the camera view at all times."

Modify the accretion disk to make it thinner and more flattened:\n```swift\nlet accretionDiskGeometry = SCNTorus(ringRadius: 2.5, pipeRadius: 0.1)\n```\n1.

Replace the `addBlackHoleAndAccretionDisk` function call in `makeUIView` with the new `addMultipleAccretionDisks` function:\n```swift\naddMultipleAccretionDisks(to: scene, count: 10)\n```\n1. Create a function to add spinning rings around the black hole's edges:\n```swift\nfunc addSpinningEdgeRings(to scene: SCNScene, count: Int) {\n    for i in 0..<count {\n        let angle = 2 * Float.pi / Float(count) * Float(i)\n        let edgeRingGeometry = SCNTorus(ringRadius: 1.05, pipeRadius: 0.05)\n        let edgeRingMaterial = SCNMaterial()\n        edgeRingMaterial.diffuse.contents = UIColor.red\n        edgeRingGeometry.materials = [edgeRingMaterial]\n        let edgeRingNode = SCNNode(geometry: edgeRingGeometry)\n        edgeRingNode.eulerAngles = SCNVector3(angle, 0, 0)\n        applyGravitationalLensingShader(to: edgeRingGeometry)\n        scene.rootNode.addChildNode(edgeRingNode)\n        addRotationToAccretionDisk(edgeRingNode)\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Call the `addSpinningEdgeRings` function in the `makeUIView` function:\n```swift\naddSpinningEdgeRings(to: scene, count: 6)\n```\nNow your `SceneKitView` struct should look like this:\n```swift\nstruct SceneKitView: UIViewRepresentable {\n    // ...\n\n    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> SCNView {\n        let scnView = SCNView()\n        let scene = SCNScene()\n        scnView.scene = scene\n        scnView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true\n```"

My name is Kwangtae Kim, and I am a doctoral student in the Industrial and Organizational Psychology program at Yonsei University, South Korea.\n\nI am reaching out to humbly request permission to use the Multidimensional Quiet Quitting Scale (MQQS) in my research. My academic focus lies in Meaningfulness and Calling, and I have been particularly intrigued by the concept of Quiet Quitting for the past year.\n\nUntil now, the absence of an officially developed scale for Quiet Quitting hindered my ability to conduct a survey-based study. Instead, I have been examining reputation text data of Korean companies found online. Recently, through a Google Scholar Alert, I was delighted to discover your pre-registered study, \"A Multidimensional Quiet Quitting Scale: Development and Test of a Measure of Quiet Quitting.\" Your proposed two-dimensional approach to Quiet Quitting, encompassing both emotional and behavioral aspects, truly resonated with me.\n\nSouth Korea is witnessing various social changes due to rapid economic growth, and Quiet Quitting is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly among millennials and Generation Z. This growing phenomenon has piqued the interest of human resources managers, who seek to understand its potential impact on organizational performance. As such, there is a burgeoning need for research in this area.\n\nI am eager to request your permission to conduct a validation study of the MQQS in the Korean context. I believe that such a study, employing a Korean sample, would not only contribute theoretically by providing empirical evidence of the MQQS's validity but also significantly aid the development of Quiet Quitting research in Korea.\n\nFurthermore, upon successful validation of the scale, I intend to continue my research by exploring ways to prevent Quiet Quitting in Korean society, linking it to Meaningfulness and Calling.\n\nYour approval would be immensely appreciated. Thank you for considering my request, and I eagerly await your response.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKwangtae Kim\nDoctoral Student\nIndustrial and Organizational Psychology\nYonsei University, South Korea"

The `enqueue` method adds an element to the end of the queue, the `is_empty` method returns `True` if the queue is empty, and the `dequeue` method removes and returns the element at the front of the queue:\n```\nclass Queue:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.items = []\n\n    def enqueue(self, item):\n        self.items.append(item)\n\n    def is_empty(self):\n        return not self.items\n\n    def dequeue(self):\n        return self.items.pop(0)\n```\nTo use the `Queue` class, you can create a new queue object and call the various methods on it. For example:\n```\nq = Queue()\n\nq.enqueue(1)\nq.enqueue(2)\nq.enqueue(3)\n\nprint(q.is_empty())  # prints False\nprint(q.dequeue())  # prints 1\nprint(q.dequeue())  # prints 2\nprint(q.dequeue())  # prints 3\nprint(q.is_empty())  # prints True\n```\nI hope this helps!

This will create a new configuration file in the `nx.json` file for the specified project.\n\nIn the new configuration file, you can add the `outputPath` option to specify the output directory for the JavaScript file. For example:\n```perl\n{\n  \"name\": \"<config-name>\",\n  \"generator\": \"@nrwl/node:execute\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"buildTarget\": \"<project-name>:build\",\n    \"outputPath\": \"dist/out-tsc/js\",\n    \"args\": []\n  }\n}\n```\nIn the above example, the `outputPath` is set to `dist/out-tsc/js`. This will create a `js` directory within the `dist/out-tsc` directory and output the JavaScript file there.\n\nOnce you have created the new configuration file, you can run the `nx run <project-name>:<config-name>` command to generate both the TypeScript bundle and the JavaScript file.\n\nNote that this assumes that you have already set up Nx and Fastify on your IBM iSeries and have a working project with TypeScript and worker threads. If you haven't done so already, you may need to install the necessary dependencies and configure your project accordingly."

There are too many functions that are not available in the Cafe24 reseller hosting service. I want you to subdivide it further so that users can use it at a low price as needed.\nFor example, moving from high-capacity hosting to low-capacity hosting is not possible! \"There is only an expensive subdomain application on Windows Server, and the payment function is working in Cafe24 solutions or builders, and even if you ask for it, you only get an answer to do it yourself.\"\n12.My Service Management > Domain-related links are too difficult to access.(Is it just me?)\n13.What are you doing? I think it's amazing. If you look at the evolution of the shopping mall manager page, you're saying that this place is a genius.

If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 1 - Contractual obligations regarding waterproofing\n\nThe appellant’s case was that, by reason of the specific contractual terms: “waterproofing membrane to sill to be provided by builder”; and that the appellant was “responsible for waterproofing of our windows only. If structure is not waterproofed correctly, warranties are voided”, the appellant was not responsible for the installation of flashing around the windows.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the terms of the contract were superseded by the Deed. The respondents relied upon clause 14 of the Deed which provided:\n\n14. Entire agreement\n\nThis Deed\n\n14.1 constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its subject matter; and\n\n14.2 in relation to that subject matter, supersedes any prior understanding or agreement between the parties and any prior condition, warranty, indemnity or representation imposed, given or made by a party.\n\nIn reply, the appellant referred to clause 7 of the Deed which we have set out at [6] above. The appellant submitted that clause 7 preserved the terms of the original contract, and that clause 14, properly construed, was intended “to avoid arguments that pre-Deed negotiations, oral representations and correspondence could form part of the Deed or affect its construction”.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed the appellant’s submissions regarding the contractual obligations relating to waterproofing at [57] as follows:\n\nThe respondents raise, by way of defence, that the windows failed because the builder, Mr Bannister, failed to install the window flashings in accordance with good building practice and that the builder’s failure to install flashing is causative of the leaks in all three windows and therefore causative of the applicant’s loss. I accept and prefer the expert evidence of Mr Brennan in his report of 17 May 2020 that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” and accept that the report of Mr Sim in respect of the flashing should be disregarded because the Schlegel Test Mr Sim considered is “irrelevant to the windows fitted on site into a timber frame with light weight external cladding”. On balance where Mr Brennan and Mr Sim differ on the issue of flashing, I accept and prefer the opinion of Mr Brennan as the more experienced expert in respect of window manufacture and installation. I also find that as Mr Sim adopted the wrong Schlegel Test, his opinion is not as persuasive.\n\nReference to the respective experts’ reports is necessary to understand that conclusion.\n\nMr Brennan’s opinion was that the windows leaked both by reason of the absence of small joint sealer and by reason of the absence of flashing around the windows.\n\nMr Sim’s opinion was that there was small joint sealer and that flashing of the windows was unnecessary. In support of the proposition that flashing was unnecessary Mr Sim stated that “the windows [are] manufactured from commercial grade sections and used sub-heads and sub-sills which act [as] a flashing”.\n\nMr Sim also stated “there is no requirement for additional flashing to the head, jambs or sills of this type of window, if installed in the correct manner as per the Schlegel Test Report.”\n\nThe Schlegel Test Report was a test report issued by Schlegel Pty Ltd, an NATA accredited laboratory, which certified the performance of a sample window. The test was carried out in 2010.\n\nMr Brennan’s evidence in reply was that testing in a “Schlegel portable test rig” did not extend to flashing as:\n\n…there are many varied building structures by which windows and doors need to be assembled into, so it is impossible to test in all building envelope constructions…\n\nThe Tribunal’s conclusion that Mr Brennan’s evidence should be preferred to the evidence of Mr Sim was a finding of fact. Clearly the Tribunal determined that the windows required flashing and that flashing had not been installed.\n\nThe conclusion that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” was based upon the statement in paragraph 4.5 of Mr Brennan’s reply report that:\n\n…Sub heads, sub jambs, and sub/sump sills are a means of installation usually used in commercial shop front and residential concrete construction. They do not substitute for flashing at any time, but especially when a cavity wall construction or timber frame light weight cladding is used. If you are using all these elements to install, you still need to flash to the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame, through to internal wall surfaces.\n\nMr Brennan did not state that it was the responsibility of the window supplier and installer to “flash to the building element”, only that it was necessary to install flashing. However, Mr Brennan did state in his oral evidence that the flashing of a window was part of the installation of the window rather than preparation of the opening for the installation of the window.\n\nIn rejecting the appellant’s submission that any leakage arising from the absence of flashing was the responsibility of the builder and not the appellant, the Tribunal does not appear to have considered the question whether the contractual provisions relating to responsibility for waterproofing cast the responsibility to install flashing on the builder, or if so, whether those provisions were superseded by the Deed.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal determined that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant and concluded on that basis that the windows were defective and required replacement.\n\nAccordingly, the question who was responsible for the installation of flashing was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was responsible for the cost of replacement of the windows. The fact that the absence of flashing might have contributed to the extent of leakage could not alter the conclusion that the windows were defective.\n\nAccordingly, ground 1 must be rejected. It involves neither an error of law nor a conclusion that was not fair and equitable or against the weight of evidence.\n\nWe reach this conclusion independently of the question whether clause 14 of the Deed, properly construed, excluded reference to the terms of the original contract. However, it is clear in our view that, in light of the explicit provision in clause 7 of the Deed, clause 14 cannot be construed as excluding reference to the terms of the original contract in ascertaining the extent of the appellant’s obligations."

The appellant submitted that in his report in reply, Mr Brennan, at 4.4, had conceded there was evidence of sealant “in some joints” but that “some joints were not sealed well enough”.\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in cross-examination, Mr Brennan had agreed that he had assumed in his first report that no small joint sealant had been used and that there was evidence of small joint sealant in some photos included in Mr Sim’s report. The appellant further submitted that Mr Brennan had “conceded that he did not know whether or not the small joint sealant had been applied correctly by BW in the process of manufacture”.\n\nThe respondents submitted that Mr Brennan had not conceded that the small joint sealant had been applied appropriately. The respondents referred to evidence given by Mr Brennan during the hearing that:\n\nAt some point there may have been small joint sealant in there and that was obvious later on when I had seen the other experts’ reports. However, it doesn’t mean it was applied correctly and evenly to every joint.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the appellant’s submissions overlooked the proposition that the windows leaked through the window frames. The respondents submitted that “the absence or presence of gaskets or small joint sealer contributed to the leaks in the windows but were not the substantial cause of the problem”.\n\nIn reply, the appellant noted that the respondents had conceded that the absence or presence of small joint sealer was not the substantial cause of the problem and submitted that “the absence of flashing was the substantial cause of the problem”. The appellant submitted that Mr Brennan had conceded in cross-examination that he did not know whether or not there were any shortcomings in the use of small joint sealant in the manufacturing process.\n\nConsideration – Ground 6\n\nIt is clear in our view that the appellant’s challenge to the Tribunal’s finding that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant does not raise any question of law. The appellant’s challenge is rather on the basis that the finding was against the weight of evidence or was not fair and equitable.\n\nThe finding of the Tribunal that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant was a finding of fact supported by the evidence of Mr Brennan. Contrary to appellant’s submissions, Mr Brennan did not at any time concede that the small joint sealant had been correctly applied within the windows. His only concession was that there was apparently some sealant within the windows but he could not say whether it had been correctly applied.\n\nWe are not persuaded that the finding of the Tribunal was against the weight of evidence or not fair and equitable. There was evidence that the windows were leaking and Mr Brennan gave evidence in his initial report that one reason for the leaking windows was the absence of gaskets or small joint sealant. Although he acknowledged in his reply report and in oral evidence that there was some sealant apparent within the windows, he did not resile from his evidence that one reason for the windows leaking was the absence of small joint sealant.\n\nMoreover, in circumstances where Mr Brennan’s evidence had clearly raised the issue whether gaskets or small joint sealant had been applied in the manufacture of the windows, the Tribunal was entitled to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference from the unexplained absence of evidence from any person who had been involved in the manufacture of the windows, that the evidence of any such person would not be of assistance to the appellant. By reason of that inference, the Tribunal could more readily accept the evidence of Mr Brennan that small joint sealant had not been properly installed.\n\nAccordingly, ground 6 must be rejected and leave to appeal on that ground must be refused.\n\nGround 7 – the cost of scaffolding\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in awarding $9,240 in respect of scaffolding, the Tribunal had failed to recognise that the respondents’ claim in respect of scaffolding had been reduced to $3,960 at the outset of the hearing.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sibilia in his evidence had initially relied upon a different document, which was an invoice dated 20 September 2019 in the amount of $9,240 for “scaffolding services rendered at the above site address”. The applicant submitted that that invoice clearly included charges for the hire of scaffolding for a period prior to the execution of the Deed.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Deed released the appellant from liability in respect of the hire of scaffolding up to the date of the Deed.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the invoice for scaffolding in the sum of $9,240 was the cost incurred by the respondents in relation to the provision of scaffolding in the period after the execution of the Deed. The respondents also submitted:\n\n“In an effort to try and resolve the matter prior to the initial hearing, the respondents requested from the scaffolding company a quote for the two weeks that the scaffolding was in place to enable the appellant’s replacement defective windows to be removed and new Wideline windows installed with make good, noting that the removal of scaffolding and reinstallation of the Wideline windows would have been a far more expensive exercise than having the scaffolding there the whole time. This was confirmed by Mr Sibilia in evidence in his cross examination [T1556-1558]. This quote came in at $3,960 (inc GST).”\n\nThe respondents submitted that the Tribunal had awarded the sum of $9,240 “as per the invoice for scaffolding as the appellant had provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary”.\n\nIn the lines of the transcript of Mr Sibilia’s evidence referred to by the respondents, Mr Sibilia stated in relation to the original claim of $9,240:\n\n“That’s what I paid because the scaffolding was there for the period of time that – we’ve adjusted that to be – for the minimum period to cover the time between completion of windows by the [inaudible] and that’s been sent through. So we’ve adjusted that down.”\n\nIn its reply submissions the appellant explained the issue more clearly as follows:\n\nThe respondents initially claimed $9,240 on the basis of invoice No 1742 dated 20 September 2019.\n\nShortly before the hearing, BW served its Tender Bundle which included another invoice No 1742 from the same scaffolding firm, this time dated 17 December 2018 in the sum of $4,420. BW could not have been liable for this amount, as it was before the Deed of Release. Further, the existence of two invoices with the same number made the later invoice unreliable as evidence.\n\nFaced with this, the respondents reduced their claim for scaffolding to $3,960 incl GST at the outset of the hearing. This was on the basis of a different document, a “Quotation” (rather than an invoice) dated 3 March 2020.\n\nAfter the hearing, the respondents in their final written submissions maintained the reduced claim for $3,960.\n\nIn relation to the quote for $3,960 the appellant submitted:\n\n“There is no evidence to support the scaffolding hire claim for $3,960, as the quote dated 3 March 2020 produced by the respondents in support of this claim was not explained in evidence. The document certainly does not speak for itself in terms of damages caused by breach of contract.\n\nConsideration – Ground 7\n\nThe Tribunal’s reasoning in relation to the award of the cost of the scaffolding was as follows, at [59]:\n\n“I accept the uncontested evidence of Mr Sibilia … that due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished. I award $9,240 for the scaffolding cost as per the invoice at Y4. I note that the respondent has provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary.”\n\nAlthough Mr Sibilia had stated in his affidavit that “due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished”, no explanation was provided why it was necessary to have scaffolding in place for seven and a half months when the windows installed by the appellant were removed and the replacement Wideline windows were installed in June. In his cross-examination Mr Sibilia acknowledged (in the passage set out above) that the amount of $9,240 which the respondents had paid was for a longer period than was necessary for the removal of the defective windows and installation of the Wideline windows. The respondents had limited their claim at the hearing to the $3,960 set out in the quote and it is apparent from the transcript that he was cross-examined on the basis that the respondents’ claim had been so limited.\n\nShortly after the answer set out above Mr Sibilia gave the following evidence:\n\n“We said that we would look at these from the point of view that look at your claims and work out – I mean we also have rent [inaudible] but we struck that out and we’ve also looked at scaffolding and reduced it to a period of time that covers when the replacement windows were put in.”\n\nThe cross-examination then moved to other topics.\n\nThe respondents sought to suggest that it would have been much more expensive to erect fresh scaffolding and take it down again. However, the quote obtained by the respondents dated 3 March 2020 - which was provided by the scaffolding contractor who had rendered the invoice dated 20 September 2019, and must therefore be taken to have been familiar with the requirements for the installation of the scaffolding – indicates that the cost would have been substantially less.\n\nThe narration to the quote is:\n\n“To supply, deliver, erect, dismantle and remove aluminium scaffolding 450kg (SWL) from the above site address\n\nTo scaffold rear of house adjacent to windows”\n\nIn our view there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support the conclusion that the invoice for $9,240 was in its entirety a cost incurred in relation to the replacement of the windows. Mr Sibilia’s statement in his affidavit did not go that far and his evidence in cross-examination was to the contrary. Moreover, the quotation of March 2020 clearly indicates that the amount of $9,240 was well in excess of the cost of providing scaffolding for the purpose of replacing the windows.\n\nAs we have noted above, the onus lay upon the respondents to prove their damages including providing evidence to establish the cost of the scaffolding necessary for the replacement of the windows.\n\nIn our view the award of $9,240 was either made without evidence or was against the weight of evidence and not fair and equitable. To award the respondents an amount they had explicitly not sought at the hearing would involve a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant in circumstances where it is apparent that the cross-examination of Mr Sibilia was predicated on the fact that the respondents only sought the amount of the quote and not the whole amount paid. It follows that the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding must be set aside. To the extent necessary we would grant leave to appeal against the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding.\n\nNevertheless, we do not consider that the respondents should receive nothing for the cost of scaffolding. Mr Dalgleish suggested at the hearing of the appeal that an allowance of $1,000 would be appropriate. However, we consider that there is evidence of the cost of providing scaffolding for the removal and replacement of the windows. We do not accept the appellant’s submission that the quotation of 3 March 2020 is not evidence of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows. That document was provided by the contractor who had provided scaffolding for the construction project and correctly identified the relevant site and the location of the windows which required replacement.\n\nWhether or not the document would meet the requirements for admissibility under the Evidence Act, the laws of evidence do not apply in the Tribunal. We consider that the quotation is sufficient evidence to establish that the appropriate compensation in respect of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows was $3,960 inclusive of GST.\n\nWe note in this context that the quote included the cost of erection and dismantling of the scaffolding, which were costs in respect of which the builder had invoiced the respondents in the third of the builder’s invoices. As we have not allowed the respondents any compensation in respect of the builder’s invoices, there is no risk of double counting in awarding the respondents the full value of the quotation.\n\nAccordingly, we will reduce the judgment sum by a further $5,280 (the difference between $9,240 and $3,960).\n\nWe note that the amount awarded by the Tribunal, $50,771.69, is $2,090 less than the sum of the three amounts which the respondents claimed. This discrepancy was not explained in the decision. It is not necessary to explore that matter further. The amount to which we consider the respondents were entitled was $14,020 in respect of the supply of the windows and $3,960 for scaffolding. The sum of those figures is $17,980, which is the amount to which we will vary the amount of the judgment."

Some key points that make KNeighborsClassifier a good choice for facial recognition include:\n\n1. Easy to Implement: KNeighborsClassifier is a simple algorithm to implement, and doesn't require a lot of computational resources. This makes it a good choice for smaller projects and applications.\n2. Fast Training Time: The KNeighborsClassifier model has a very fast training time, since it simply stores the training data and does not do any computations until it is time to predict.\n3. High Accuracy: KNeighborsClassifier has been shown to be highly accurate for facial recognition, especially when the number of neighbors is set appropriately.\n4. Flexible Distance Metrics: KNeighborsClassifier allows for different distance metrics to be used, which can be helpful when dealing with different types of data.\n5. Non-Parametric: KNeighborsClassifier is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This can be an advantage in situations where the data is not normally distributed.\n6. Robust to Noise: KNeighborsClassifier can be robust to noisy data, since it looks at the k nearest neighbors and takes a majority vote to classify the data. This can help reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points.\n\nOverall, KNeighborsClassifier can be a good choice for facial recognition tasks due to its ease of implementation, fast training time, high accuracy, and robustness to noise."

She spent her days crafting tales of adventure and excitement, and her work was beloved by many.\n\nOne day, as Nanna was walking through the bustling streets of her city, she looked up at the sky and saw a cloud that was shaped exactly like a desert island. The cloud was so clear and detailed that it looked as if she could reach out and touch it.\n\nAt first, Nanna was puzzled by the sight. She had never seen a cloud like this before, and she couldn't understand why it would take on the shape of a desert island. But as she continued to stare at the cloud, an idea began to form in her mind.\n\nShe quickly rushed home and sat down at her writing desk, eager to capture the inspiration that had struck her. As she began to write, the words flowed easily and the story came to life on the page.\n\nThe story was about a group of travelers who were shipwrecked on a desert island and had to survive against all odds. They faced challenges and obstacles at every turn, but through determination and hard work, they were able to build a new life for themselves on the island.\n\nNanna was thrilled with the story she had written, and she knew that it would be a hit with her audience. She spent the next few days polishing the script and adding the finishing touches, and when she was finally satisfied, she presented it to the leaders of her city.\n\nThey were impressed by Nanna's work and immediately gave her the resources she needed to bring the story to life on the big screen. The movie was a huge success, and Nanna was hailed as a master of her craft.\n\nFrom that day on, Nanna always looked to the skies for inspiration, knowing that the shapes of the clouds could spark the most incredible stories. And she continued to thrill audiences with her imaginative and exciting tales, becoming one of the most celebrated screenwriters of her time."

You have two options: you could use a damp cloth to wipe it down, or you could use a dry erase marker to draw over the stains and then erase them.\n\nUsing a damp cloth is like traditional carpet cleaning methods, where water or a cleaning solution is applied to the carpet and then extracted with a wet vacuum. This method can work well, but it can also leave behind moisture in the carpet, which can lead to mold and mildew growth or other issues.\n\nUsing a dry erase marker is like very low moisture carpet cleaning. Instead of using water, a special cleaning solution is applied to the carpet in a controlled amount, just enough to break down the dirt and stains. Then, a machine is used to agitate the solution and lift the dirt to the surface of the carpet. Finally, the machine uses a powerful vacuum to remove the dirt and solution, leaving the carpet clean and dry.\n\nIn this analogy, the dry erase marker represents the low-moisture cleaning solution, and the machine represents the equipment used to clean the carpet. Just like the dry erase marker, the low-moisture solution is applied in a targeted way to clean the carpet without leaving behind any excess moisture. This makes it a great option for carpets that can't handle a lot of water or for areas where quick drying is important."

Therefore:\n\nstopping distance = perception distance + braking distance\n140 m = 55.56 m + braking distance\nbraking distance = 84.44 m\n\nNow we can solve for the grade of the road:\n\ngrade = rise / run\ngrade = braking distance / horizontal distance\ngrade = braking distance / sqrt((stopping distance)^2 - (braking distance)^2)\ngrade = 84.44 m / sqrt((140 m)^2 - (84.44 m)^2)\ngrade ≈ 0.182\n\nTherefore, the grade of the road is approximately 0.182, or 18.2%."

        "value": "You can connect to an Ethereum smart contract using Web3.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the basic steps to get started:\n\n1. Make sure you have a local copy of the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) and the address of the deployed contract.\n2. Include the Web3.js library in your project by adding the following line to your HTML file:\n```\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web3@1.3.0/dist/web3.min.js\"></script>\n```\n3. Initialize a new Web3 instance and set the provider to the Ethereum node you want to connect to. For example, if you want to connect to the Rinkeby testnet, you can use the following code:\n```\nconst web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"));\n```\n4. Create a new contract instance by passing the ABI and contract address to the web3.eth.Contract() method. For example:\n```\nconst contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, contractAddress);\n```\n5. Now you can call methods on the contract instance and interact with the contract. For example, you can call a method called `get()` on the contract like this:\n```\ncontract.methods.get().call()\n  .then(console.log)\n```\n6. If the contract has write methods, you'll need to sign the transaction with an Ethereum account's private key before sending it to the network."

Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes have broken down how they kept their real-life romance and split from affecting their roles on Outer Banks.\n\nThe Netflix series, which debuted in April 2020, introduced viewers to a coastal town in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which is divided into wealthy and working-class sides. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers accidentally find themselves at the center of a dangerous treasure hunt.\n\nDuring the first season, John B (Stokes) and Sarah (Cline) developed a romantic relationship even though they were divided by their social status. At the time, fans questioned whether Stokes and Cline’s connection developed into something more off screen.\n\nAfter going public, the Maryland native recalled how he and the Glass Onion star initially tried not to act on their feelings.\n\n“At that point in time, we were so anxious about the show and so nervous about constantly screwing up. I think we were all under this sort of strange umbrella of, like, ‘Dear God, we got an opportunity. Let’s not screw it up!’ So, it was just always work-oriented — really until the day we wrapped,” he exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2021. “It wasn’t until after that, until we started to kind of get into the [coronavirus] lockdown where we were like, ‘Is there something here or am I crazy?’ That’s sort of where it bloomed from there. I think we were just so invested in the work.”\n\nUs confirmed in November 2021 that the pair had called it quits after more than one year of dating. The news came after season 2 was released on the streaming service. Since then, Cline has been linked to Zack Bia and later Jackson Guthy. Stokes, for his part, was spotted packing on the PDA with Kelsea Ballerini following her divorce from Morgan Evans.\n\nAhead of Outer Banks‘ season 3 release, the former couple discussed how they have “always shown up for each other” at work. Showrunner Jonas Pate also praised Stokes and Cline for focusing on their job since their split.\n\n“Honestly, and this isn’t just me: they’re pros,” he told Entertainment Weekly in February 2023. “They handled themselves unbelievably on set, and you would never know that they had an off-camera relationship. They were great. It’s a credit to Chase and to Maddie, they just put their heads down and did the work, so good for them.”\n\nThat same month, the model revealed how her relationship with Stokes affected her dating life going forward, telling Cosmopolitan, “I am a really private person. There’s a part of me that is for me and nobody else. But in hindsight, duh, making my relationship public made it everybody else’s business.”\n\nShe continued: “And I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn’t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy. People see the need for sides. There are no sides — there’s no winning or losing in a breakup.”\n\nBusiness As Usual\nIn February 2023, the pair praised their ability to keep their focus on Outer Banks.\n\n\"Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,\" the actor told EW. \"And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we're always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.\"\n\nStaying Professional\n\"We had a working relationship before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it,\" the Vice Principals alum shared with EW. \"I'm really, really happy, and I'm very proud of the work this season, and I'm incredibly grateful for my costars and their professionalism and just how talented each and every one of them are.\"\nFocusing on Their Craft\nCline explained how she was able to stay on good terms with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"We always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job,\" she said to Cosmopolitan in February 2023. \"And while that’s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I’m really appreciative of that.\"\n\nNetflix stars Chase Stokes and Madelyn Cline are able to keep things professional when it comes time to film Outer Banks. The former couple has spoken at length about separating their real-life relationship from work when stepping on set as John B and Sarah Cameron! While they’ve since split, the Netflix stars are still able to keep things professional.\n\n“It’s been a lot of fun to drive together to work, come home and throw ideas off of each other about different scenes, collaborating, watching her get excited about her work and be her cheerleader,” Chase told People in March 2021 about working alongside his real-life love. “The beautiful thing for us is that our relationship was established as friends and coworkers prior to what we have now. The biggest difference now is I get to be even more proud of her as my partner when I watch her work.”\n\nThe actors first met when they were cast as the protagonists in Netflix’s Outer Banks. After the show premiered its first season in April 2020, fans were quick to speculate that Chase and Madelyn were more than just friends off screen. It wasn’t until June 2020 when they confirmed their relationship. At the time, Chase uploaded an Instagram photo with his girlfriend alongside a caption that read, “Cat’s outta the bag.”\n\nAs for how they went from coworkers to something more? Chase explained to Us Weekly in February 2021 that “it was just always work-oriented — really until the day we wrapped.” Once they finished filming season 1, things turned romantic.\n\n“It wasn’t until after that, until we started to kind of get into the lockdown where we were like, ‘Is there something here or am I crazy?’” the actor recalled to Us Weekly. “That’s sort of where it bloomed, from there. I think we were just so invested in the work.”\n\nWhen it came time for Chase and Madelyn to bring their newfound relationship back to the Outer Banks set for season 2, costar Julia Antonelli (who plays Wheezie Cameron) told J-14 exclusively in July 2021 that they’re “so cool together” on set.\n\n“They are literally the cutest together. Honest to God. They’re so cute,” she gushed. “They’re so chill, and it’s just cool to see them. They get along so well. So, it’s just awesome to see them like chilling on set together. That’s really cute because, of course, they’re dating in the show as well.”\n\nUnfortunately, multiple reports in November 2021 confirmed that the couple had called it quits. Scroll through our gallery to read Chase and Madelyn’s quotes about how they worked together on Outer Banks.\n\nNo Crossover on Set\n“We always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job. And while that’s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I’m really appreciative of that,” Madelyn explained to Cosmopolitan in February 2023, noting that she doesn’t “owe anyone an explanation.”\n\nOverall, she had some regrets about showing the relationship online.\n\n“Making my relationship public made it everybody else’s business,” the actress added. “And I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn’t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy.”\n\nReturning for Season 3\n“Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,” Chase told Entertainment Weekly in February 2023 about their past relationship. “And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we’re always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.”\n\nMadelyn, for her part, added, “We had a working relationship before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it. I’m really, really happy and I’m very proud of the work this season, and I’m incredibly grateful for my costars and their professionalism and just how talented each and every one of them are.”\n\nKeeping It Professional\n“We’re both professionals. We always have been since day one,” Madelyn told W Magazine in August 2022 about working alongside Chase. “Outer Banks is a big family, and at the end of the day, we show up, we’re professional, and we do our jobs.”\n\nOn the Same Page\nMadelyn explained that the couple “laid the groundwork first and foremost” before heading back to set.\n\n“I was like, ‘This is a big priority to me, and you know, from what I know based on how you work, it is for you too. But I want to make sure that we hold each other accountable and that we don’t bring anything personal that could potentially distract each other or our fellow castmates on the day,’” she said during an August 2021 appearance on The Talk. “So, it wasn’t hard at all, and I really respect that about him and our relationship.”\n\nSeparating Work and the Relationship\nDuring the same talk show appearance, Madelyn noted that “my workspace was incredibly sacred.”\n\n“It’s very personal to me and I do not like to bring any sort of personal troubles to my workspace,” she explained. “I’m kind of notorious for even turning my phone off and not answering it for hours, or just like leaving it in my trailer, because I like to focus on what’s in front of me. I’m very much of a one-track mind kind of person.”\n\nNo Issues on Set\n“Madelyn and I are very transparent about our relationship and we keep our personal stuff at home,” the heartthrob told Fashion Week Daily in August 2021. “Obviously, we spent a lot of time together, so there’s definitely some that leaks through! And that’s totally fine. But it’s fun to create characters that are not ourselves, and then make different decisions than what we would probably normally make. So it’s fun; it’s a lot of fun to sort of dive into a different world.”\n\nDifferentiating Their Real-Life and Onscreen Romance\n“There’s been a lot of attention on our relationship outside of the show in the off season. We recognize that. And we recognize that it’s incredibly important to separate ourselves from the characters,” Chase told Decider in July 2021. “This season was a lot of thought for her and I to make these characters different. … So, we definitely made sure that there’s a difference between the two, especially as we go through our careers. We don’t want to be seen as just single-minded or linear. We want to be multi-faceted and be able to do things outside of John B and Sarah. So it’s great, but I think we’re very conscious of making sure those characters live in a different world than Maddie and Chase do.”\n\nA Great Relationship\n“We have a very healthy relationship because it started with the work first,” Chase explained while chatting with V Man in July 2021. “For season 2, as soon as we get to work, we’ll support each other. We’ll be scene partners and take care of each other when it’s an emotional moment. But it doesn’t mean that if I don’t believe you, that I’m not going to call you out and she holds me to the same standard. Then, as soon as we get back to our trailers and we’re taking off our makeup and character clothes, it’s like that world disappears. I’m very thankful for her and the journey we’re on, it’s been awesome.”\nGetting Into Character\n“Whether you’re an accountant, whether you work in marketing or you’re an engineer, if you work with your partner, you kinda gotta put it all aside and just go to work and do your job,” Chase explained to Life & Style in July 2020. “It works out.”"

When comic books were\naccused of turning juveniles into delinquents in the 1950s, crime was falling to record lows, just as the denunciations of\nvideo games in the 1990s coincided with the\ngreat American crime decline. The decades\nof television, transistor radios and rock videos\nwere also decades in which I.Q. scores rose\ncontinuously.\nFor a reality check today, take the state\nof science, which demands high levels of\nbrainwork and is measured by clear benchmarks of discovery. These days scientists are\nnever far from their email, rarely touch paper\nand cannot lecture without PowerPoint. If\nelectronic media were hazardous to intelligence, the quality of science would be plummeting. Yet discoveries are multiplying like\nfruit flies, and progress is dizzying. Other activities in the life of the mind, like philosophy,\nhistory and cultural criticism, are likewise\nflourishing, as anyone who has lost a morning\nof work to the website Arts & Letters Daily\ncan attest.\nCritics of new media sometimes use science itself to press their case, citing\nresearch that shows how “experience can change the brain.” But cognitive\nneuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every time we learn a fact or skill\nthe wiring of the brain changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the\npancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does not mean the brain is a blob\nof clay pounded into shape by experience.\nExperience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of\nthe brain. Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just that, but the\nverdict was rendered by Woody Allen after he read War and Peace in one sitting:\n“It was about Russia.” Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a myth,\nnot just by laboratory studies but by the familiar sight of an S.U.V. undulating\nbetween lanes as the driver cuts a deal on his cellphone.\nMoreover, as the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons\nshow in their new book The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions\nDeceive Us, the effects of experience are highly specific to the experiences\nthemselves. If you train people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math\npuzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing that thing, but almost\nnothing else. Music doesn’t make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t\nmake you more logical, brain-training games don’t make you smarter.\nAccomplished people don’t bulk up their brains with intellectual calisthenics;\nthey immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read lots of novels, scientists\nread lots of science. The effects of consuming electronic media are also likely to be far more\nlimited than the panic implies. Media critics write as if the brain takes on the\nqualities of whatever it consumes, the informational equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with primitive peoples who believe that eating fierce animals will\nmake them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in rock videos turns\nyour mental life into quick cuts or that reading bullet points and Twitter turns\nyour thoughts into bullet points and Twitter postings.\nYes, the constant arrival of information packets can be distracting or\naddictive, especially to people with attention deficit disorder. But distraction is\nnot a new phenomenon. The solution is not to bemoan technology but to\ndevelop strategies of self-control, as we do with every other temptation in life.\nTurn off email or Twitter when you work, put away your BlackBerry at dinner time,\nask your spouse to call you to bed at a designated hour.\nAnd to encourage intellectual depth, don’t rail at PowerPoint or Google. It’s\nnot as if habits of deep reflection, thorough research and rigorous reasoning\never came naturally to people. They must be acquired in special institutions,\nwhich we call universities, and maintained with constant upkeep, which we call\nanalysis, criticism and debate. They are not granted by propping a heavy encyclopedia on your lap, nor are they taken away by efficient access to information\non the Internet.\nThe new media have caught on for a reason. Knowledge is increasing\nexponentially; human brainpower and waking hours are not. Fortunately, the\nInternet and information technologies are helping us manage, search and\nretrieve our collective intellectual output at different scales, from Twitter and\npreviews to e-books and online encyclopedias. Far from making us stupid, these\ntechnologies are the only things that will keep us smart."

Pinker challenges the notion that these technologies are responsible for shrinking attention spans, reducing our capacity for deep reflection, and encouraging superficial knowledge. Instead, he suggests that the state of science, as measured by clear benchmarks of discovery, is evidence that electronic media are not hazardous to intelligence.\n\nIn this critique, I intend to examine Pinker's argument and evaluate its validity. I will consider the evidence he presents to support his claim and assess its credibility. I will also examine the limitations of Pinker's argument and consider alternative perspectives. Additionally, I will provide some background information on Pinker, who is a prominent cognitive psychologist, linguist, and popular science author, to help contextualize his perspective on this topic."

This feature ensures that the inventory data is tamper-proof and transparent, preventing any fraudulent activity.\n2. Smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts can be used to automate inventory management processes, such as tracking shipments and deliveries, managing orders and payments, and verifying authenticity.\n3. Decentralized database: A blockchain-based inventory management system can be decentralized, meaning that the data is not stored in a single location, but rather on a distributed network of computers. This provides an additional layer of security and ensures that the data is available even if one node on the network fails.\n4. Increased traceability: Blockchain technology allows for increased traceability in the supply chain. Each transaction or movement of goods can be recorded on the blockchain, allowing for easy tracking and identification of any issues or discrepancies.\n\nOverall, a blockchain-based inventory management system can provide increased security, transparency, and traceability, which can be particularly beneficial in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management."

She was said to possess a natural gift for mysticism and spirituality, and was often sought out by her community for guidance and healing.\n\nOne day, while Ayasha was out gathering herbs in the nearby woods, she stumbled upon a strange artifact. It was a small, intricately carved stone that seemed to emanate a powerful energy. Ayasha knew that she had stumbled upon something special and took the stone back to her home.\n\nAs she spent more time with the stone, Ayasha began to feel its energy more strongly, and she realized that it was a tool for manifesting her desires. She could focus her intentions on the stone and watch as her dreams became reality.\n\nWord of Ayasha's newfound power quickly spread throughout the reservation, and many sought her out for help with their own desires. Ayasha was more than happy to assist, but as time went on, she began to realize the dangers of using the stone for selfish gain.\n\nOne day, a group of outsiders arrived on the reservation, seeking to take control of the land and its resources. The tribal leaders knew that they would need to fight back if they were to protect their home and their way of life, but they were outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nAyasha knew that the situation was dire, and so she turned to the stone for guidance. She focused all of her intentions on protecting her people and their land, and as she did, a powerful force began to build around her.\n\nThe outsiders were taken aback as they watched Ayasha grow stronger and stronger, her energy pulsing with an otherworldly power. They were no match for her, and so they retreated back to their own territory.\n\nFrom that day on, Ayasha was seen as a hero by her people. She had saved them from certain destruction, and had shown them the true power of mysticism and the law of attraction.\n\nBut as time went on, Ayasha began to realize the true cost of her power. She had become so focused on using the stone to protect her people that she had lost sight of her own desires and her own happiness.\n\nAnd so, Ayasha made the difficult decision to give up the stone, knowing that it would mean the end of her power and her influence over the community. She disappeared from the reservation soon after, leaving behind only a vague memory of her supernatural abilities and the legend of the stone.\n\nToday, visitors to the reservation often report strange occurrences and sightings, as if Ayasha's energy still lingers in the area. Some say that they have seen her ghostly figure wandering the woods, searching for the stone that she gave up so many years ago.\n\nThe legend of Ayasha and the stone has become a cautionary tale for those who seek power and control at any cost. It serves as a reminder that true power comes from within, and that the pursuit of our own desires can sometimes lead us down a dangerous path."

Unfortunately, these challenges can take a toll on students' mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and other serious mental health issues. As a society, we need to recognize the importance of mental health and provide adequate support to students who are struggling. This essay argues that universities have a responsibility to prioritize mental health support for students, and that doing so will have significant benefits for both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nPoint 1: The prevalence of mental health issues in universities\nStudies show that mental health issues are common among college students. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in four college students has a diagnosable mental health disorder, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. These conditions can have a significant impact on students' ability to succeed academically and socially, as well as on their overall well-being.\n\nPoint 2: The benefits of mental health support for students\nProviding mental health support to students can have a range of benefits, both for individuals and for society as a whole. For example, when students receive mental health support, they are more likely to stay in school and complete their degrees. This can lead to better career prospects and higher earning potential, which can benefit society as a whole by reducing unemployment and poverty.\n\nMoreover, mental health support can improve students' overall well-being, leading to happier and healthier individuals. This, in turn, can lead to a more productive and engaged society, as mentally healthy individuals are better able to contribute to their communities and participate in civic life.\n\nCounterargument:\nSome may argue that universities cannot be expected to provide mental health support to students, as this is outside of their primary mission of providing academic education. However, this argument ignores the fact that mental health is a critical component of overall well-being, and that universities have a responsibility to support students in all aspects of their lives.\n\nFurthermore, universities already provide a range of support services to students, including health services, counseling, and academic advising. Providing mental health support is simply an extension of these existing services, and is essential to ensuring that students are able to succeed academically and socially.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, mental health support is a critical component of student success in universities, and universities have a responsibility to provide adequate support to students who are struggling. By prioritizing mental health support, universities can help students overcome mental health issues, stay in school, and achieve their academic and personal goals. This, in turn, can lead to a more productive and engaged society, with healthier and happier individuals who are better able to contribute to their communities."

        "value": "To create the backend for your paraphrasing tool, you will need to integrate natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning models. There are several steps involved in this process, including tokenizing the input text, generating paraphrased text, and returning the output to the frontend.\n\nHere are the steps to create the backend for your paraphrasing tool:\n\n1. Install the necessary libraries\nTo perform NLP and machine learning tasks, you will need to install the following libraries:\n* Tensorflow: A popular machine learning library\n* Hugging Face Transformers: A library for state-of-the-art NLP models\n\nYou can install these libraries using the following commands in the command prompt or terminal:\n```\npip install tensorflow\npip install transformers\n```\n1. Load the pre-trained model\nYou will need to load a pre-trained model for generating paraphrased text. Hugging Face provides several pre-trained models that you can use, such as T5, GPT-2, and BERT. For this example, we will use the T5 model.\n\nYou can load the T5 model using the following code:\n```csharp\nconst model = await tf.loadGraphModel('path/to/t5/model.json');\n```\n1. Load the tokenizer\nYou will also need to load the tokenizer that was used to pre-process the input data for the pre-trained model. This is necessary for encoding and decoding the text.\n\nYou can load the tokenizer using the following code:\n```arduino\nconst tokenizer = new Tokenizer();\n```\n1. Process the input text\nWhen the user submits the original text in the frontend, you will need to tokenize the text and encode it using the loaded tokenizer. This will convert the text into a numerical representation that can be processed by the model.\n\nYou can tokenize the input text using the following code:\n```arduino\nconst tokenizedText = tokenizer.encode(inputText);\nconst inputIds = tf.tensor2d(tokenizedText, [1, tokenizedText.length], 'int32');\n```\n1. Generate the paraphrased text\nOnce the input text has been encoded, you can use the pre-trained model to generate paraphrased text. You can pass the encoded input text to the model and specify parameters such as the maximum length of the output text, the number of beams to use for decoding, and whether or not to use early stopping.\n\nYou can generate the paraphrased text using the following code:\n```php\nconst outputs = await model.executeAsync({\n    input_ids: inputIds,\n    max_length: 50,\n    num_beams: 10,\n    early_stopping: true,\n    return_tensors: true\n});\nconst paraphrasedText = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0].dataSync());\nconsole.log(paraphrasedText);\n```\n1. Return the output to the frontend\nFinally, you can return the generated paraphrased text to the frontend. You can do this by sending a JSON response that contains the paraphrased text.\n\nYou can return the output to the frontend using the following code:\n```css\nres.json({ paraphrasedText: paraphrasedText });\n```\nNote: The above code snippets are written in JavaScript and assume that you are using Node.js for the backend. You will need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements and programming language. Additionally, you will need to implement the code within a server-side script or application that can handle HTTP requests from the frontend."

They may be used to control the spread of contaminants, protect workers from hazardous materials, or prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas.\n\nExamples of reusable barriers include walls, fences, gates, doors, airlocks, and containment chambers. In some cases, reusable barriers may also incorporate sensors or other monitoring technologies to enhance their effectiveness and provide real-time feedback on conditions within the protected area."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Category theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the commonalities and patterns that exist across different mathematical structures. It has found applications in a wide range of fields, including computer science and software engineering. In the design domain, category theory can be helpful for organizing and structuring complex systems, identifying relationships between different components, and providing a framework for reasoning about their behavior.\n\nOne way category theory can be applied to the design of software systems is by using the concept of a \"category\" to model different components and their relationships. A category consists of a collection of objects and a collection of arrows (also called morphisms) that connect pairs of objects. These arrows represent the relationships between the objects and can be used to compose different components together to form more complex structures.\n\nIn the context of an ecommerce application, category theory could be used to model the different components of the system, such as products, customers, orders, and payments, and the relationships between them. For example, we could define an \"object\" for each of these components, along with a set of \"arrows\" that connect them. These arrows could represent different relationships, such as \"a customer can place an order,\" \"an order can contain one or more products,\" and \"a payment can be associated with an order.\"\n\nIn JavaScript, we could use a library like Category Theory for JavaScript (catj) to define the objects and arrows in our category. Here's an example of how we could define a simple category for an ecommerce application:\n```php\nconst catj = require('catj');\n\n// Define objects\nconst Product = catj.object('Product');\nconst Customer = catj.object('Customer');\nconst Order = catj.object('Order');\nconst Payment = catj.object('Payment');\n\n// Define arrows\nconst PlaceOrder = catj.arrow('PlaceOrder', Customer, Order);\nconst OrderContainsProduct = catj.arrow('OrderContainsProduct', Order, Product);\nconst PaymentForOrder = catj.arrow('PaymentForOrder', Payment, Order);\n\n// Compose arrows\nconst PaymentForProduct = PaymentForOrder.compose(OrderContainsProduct);\n\n// Print composition table\nconsole.log(catj.composeTable([PaymentForOrder, OrderContainsProduct], [PaymentForProduct]));\n```\nIn this example, we define four objects (Product, Customer, Order, and Payment) and three arrows (PlaceOrder, OrderContainsProduct, and PaymentForOrder). We then compose two of these arrows (PaymentForOrder and OrderContainsProduct) to create a new arrow (PaymentForProduct) that represents the relationship between a payment and a product. Finally, we use the `composeTable` function to print a table that shows the composition of PaymentForProduct in terms of PaymentForOrder and OrderContainsProduct.\n\nThis is just a simple example, but it illustrates how category theory can be used to model complex systems and provide a framework for reasoning about their behavior. By using categories to organize and structure different components, we can gain insights into the relationships between them and develop more robust and scalable software systems."

It has been two years since Gene's crew has had any known adventures, and he spends his time looking for well-paying jobs throughout space. The player begins the game with 250,000 wong in their bank account, which is the universally accepted currency and is roughly equivalent to the American dollar.\n\nTo survive in the game, the player must use their currency wisely. Whenever they spend money, the game will report their new total. Making wise spending decisions is essential for the player's survival because serious errors could cause the game to end, and the player may die. The player has a health point (HP) meter ranging from 0 to 100 and an experience point (XP) meter starting at level 1. Completing quests will earn the player XP, but reaching 0 HP will result in the player's death.\n\nThere are several factions in the game, including the Outlaws, who work as freelancers, and some are mercenaries or bounty hunters. They have a neutral position on most matters. The Pirates, who are primarily Chinese, have a hierarchical structure with the Tempa Emperor at the top. The Kei guild and Ban guild are two primary guilds of pirates. The Kei guild is known for successfully hunting down and killing the infamous outlaw \"Hot Ice\" Hilda, who stole the experimental spaceship XGP15A-II from them. They are also after Gene Starwind. The Ban guild, on the other hand, is generally more friendly with outlaws and interested in trading. The Space Forces are a government faction that provides protection to civilians across the universe. They have a clear hatred for all pirates and will often pursue them. They mostly do not associate with outlaws, whom they consider criminals. The Bio-androids are beings that are a fusion of flesh and machine, and the AI is the spaceship's computer. Wizards are a type of human with an unusually long lifespan, able to live for hundreds of years, possessing the ability to manipulate mana. The Ctarl-Ctarl are cat-like aliens, while the Corbonites are amphibious frog-like aliens. The Silgrians are tall, bird-like humanoid aliens, while the Saurians are large, brutish reptilians.\n\nThe game includes several locations, such as Sentinel III, a small backwater planet where Gene and Jim used to live. Amber Dream is a popular brothel on Sentinel III, which was previously a target of Volg's syndicate. Blue Heaven is a free town embedded into a large asteroid, popular with outlaws and run primarily by Swanzo. Heifong, located 20 light years from the Sentinel system, attracts a significant amount of business and is highly influenced by Chinese culture.\n\nThe player can find many different items across space. They will always carry three items: Outlaw Star ship's key, a combat knife, and a caster gun. The caster gun fires extremely powerful magic spells by loading it with caster shells, which can only be fired once until depletion. The player will only have one caster shell at the beginning of the game, a #13 shell. This shell fires a small black hole that will kill all foes. However, it will drain half of the player's HP, killing them if they have less than half. There are many other caster shells across the galaxy. Most are not as powerful as this, but they are all expensive antiques and very rare to find.\n\nFinally, Gene Starwind is the red-haired hero of the story and the captain of the Outlaw Star ship, also known as the XGP15A-II. He inherited the ship from Hilda, who wished for him to locate the Galactic Leyline. Gene has a traumatic past, having lost his father to Ronald MacDougall and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a fear of space. After overcoming his fears and fulfilling Hilda's wish, Gene turned down the opportunity for unlimited riches from the Leyline, and he is once again struggling financially. Gene's business is Starwind & Hawking Enterprises. He runs it with Jim Hawking. He is also helped by his other allies: Melfina (now his wife), Twilight Suzuka and Aisha Clanclan."

Roie immediately sprang into action, grabbing his fire hose and rushing towards the burning building.\n\nAs he entered the house, the smoke was thick and choking, making it difficult to see or breathe. But Roie pushed on, determined to save anyone or anything that might still be inside. It wasn't long before he heard a faint barking sound coming from one of the upstairs rooms.\n\nFollowing the sound, Roie climbed the stairs and soon found himself face to face with a terrified little dog, cowering in the corner of the room. Roie quickly scooped up the dog and carried it outside to safety, where it was greeted by its relieved owner.\n\nThanks to Roie's quick thinking and bravery, the dog was saved from the burning house. And for Roie, it was just another day on the job, serving his community and saving lives."

        "value": "FizzBuzz is a well-known coding challenge where you have to print out the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, you print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, you print \"Buzz.\" For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, you print \"FizzBuzz.\"\n\nTo design a circuit that plays FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays, you would need to break down the problem into smaller components. Here's one possible approach:\n\n1. Create a counter that counts from 1 to 100. You can use a 4-bit binary counter such as the 74161, which has a synchronous reset input that you can use to reset the counter to 1.\n2. Use logic gates to determine whether the current count is a multiple of three, five, or both. For example, you can use a combination of AND gates and comparators to check if the count is divisible by 3 or 5. If the count is divisible by both 3 and 5, then it is a multiple of 15 (i.e., FizzBuzz).\n3. Use a decoder such as the 7447 or 74148 to convert the binary output of the counter into a seven-segment display output. You will need to connect the decoder to a 7-segment display, which can display the numbers 0-9 as well as some letters.\n4. Use additional logic gates to control which output is displayed on the 7-segment display based on whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. For example, if the count is a multiple of 3, you can display \"F\" on the leftmost segment of the display, and if it is a multiple of 5, you can display \"B\" on the rightmost segment. If it is a multiple of both, you can display \"FB\" on the display.\n\nHere's a high-level diagram of what the circuit might look like:\n```lua\n+-------+      +-----+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------+\n+-------+      +-----+       |\n                 |           |\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n                                     |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |  7-segment\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+  display\n                 |                    |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n                                     |\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n                 |           |       |\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n                                     |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n```\nIn this diagram, the 74161 counter is connected to three AND gates, each of which checks whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or 15 (i.e., both 3 and 5). The outputs of these AND gates are connected to additional AND gates, which control which output"

Use the `random.choices` function from the `random` module to randomly select N tuples from the list created in step 1, taking into account the weights associated with each tuple.\n3. Extract the items from the N selected tuples and return them as a list.\n\nHere's some example code to demonstrate this approach:\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_weighted_sample(items, n):\n    weighted_items = [(item, weight) for item, weight in items]\n    selected_items = random.choices(weighted_items, weights=[weight for item, weight in weighted_items], k=n)\n    return [item for item, weight in selected_items]\n\n# Example usage\nitems = [('a', 2), ('b', 3), ('c', 1), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)]\nn = 3\nsample = random_weighted_sample(items, n)\nprint(sample)\n```\nIn this example, `items` is the original list of items with weights, and `n` is the number of random elements to select. The `random_weighted_sample` function first creates a list of tuples with each item and its corresponding weight, and then uses `random.choices` to randomly select `n` tuples, taking into account the weights. Finally, it extracts the items from the selected tuples and returns them as a list."

The investment manager then uses this capital to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets on behalf of the investors. The returns generated by the fund are then distributed among the investors based on the number of units or shares they hold.\n\nA collective, on the other hand, is a type of investment vehicle that is owned and controlled by its members. A collective can take different forms, such as a cooperative, a mutual or a credit union. Unlike a fund, a collective is not usually managed by a professional investment manager, but rather by its members who make investment decisions collectively. The returns generated by the collective are then distributed among the members based on their participation in the collective.\n\nIn summary, a fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets, while a collective is an investment vehicle owned and controlled by its members who make investment decisions collectively."

When the number of rows is reached you can append the remaining strings to the last row. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to achieve this:\n```\ndef max_columns(S, W):\n    n_cols = len(S) // W  # Number of columns\n    if len(S) % W != 0:\n        n_cols += 1\n    rows = []\n    current_row = []\n    col_idx = 0\n    for string in S:\n        current_row.append(string)\n        col_idx += 1\n        if col_idx == n_cols:\n            rows.append(current_row)\n            current_row = []\n            col_idx = 0\n    if current_row:\n        rows.append(current_row)\n    return n_cols\n```\nWith this approach, the last row will have less columns than the others if the number of strings does not divide evenly by the number of columns, but all other rows will have the same number of columns and the maximum number of columns will be returned."

The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by the massive river far below you.\n\nYou step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where not to step.\n\nConsider a rope with a knot at each end; these knots mark the head and the tail of the rope. If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.\n\nDue to nebulous reasoning involving Planck lengths, you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical series of motions (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.\n\nDue to the aforementioned Planck lengths, the rope must be quite short; in fact, the head (H) and tail (T) must always be touching (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching):\n\n....\n.TH.\n....\n\n....\n.H..\n..T.\n....\n\n...\n.H. (H covers T)\n...\nIf the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction so it remains close enough:\n\n..... ..... .....\n.TH.. -> .T.H. -> ..TH.\n..... ..... .....\n\n... ... ...\n.T. .T. ...\n.H. -> ... -> .T.\n... .H. .H.\n... ... ...\nOtherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up:\n\n..... ..... .....\n..... ..H.. ..H..\n..H.. -> ..... -> ..T..\n.T... .T... .....\n..... ..... .....\n\n..... ..... .....\n..... ..... .....\n..H.. -> ...H. -> ..TH.\n.T... .T... .....\n..... ..... .....\nYou just need to work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.\n\nFor example:\n\nR 4\nU 4\nL 3\nD 1\nR 4\nD 1\nL 5\nR 2\nThis series of motions moves the head right four steps, then up four steps, then left three steps, then down one step, and so on. After each step, you'll need to update the position of the tail if the step means the head is no longer adjacent to the tail. Visually, these motions occur as follows (s marks the starting position as a reference point):\n\n== Initial State ==\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\nH.....

The term is computed as the sum of squares of all model parameters, multiplied by a scalar hyperparameter called the regularization strength or lambda. This results in the optimization process balancing between minimizing the loss and keeping the weights small. The regularization term is added to the loss during training, and the model is optimized to minimize the total loss, including the regularization term."

        "value": "FizzBuzz is a well-known coding challenge where you have to print out the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, you print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, you print \"Buzz.\" For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, you print \"FizzBuzz.\"\n\nTo design a circuit that plays FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays, you would need to break down the problem into smaller components. Here's one possible approach:\n\n1. Create a counter that counts from 1 to 100. You can use a 4-bit binary counter such as the 74161, which has a synchronous reset input that you can use to reset the counter to 1.\n2. Use logic gates to determine whether the current count is a multiple of three, five, or both. For example, you can use a combination of AND gates and comparators to check if the count is divisible by 3 or 5. If the count is divisible by both 3 and 5, then it is a multiple of 15 (i.e., FizzBuzz).\n3. Use a decoder such as the 7447 or 74148 to convert the binary output of the counter into a seven-segment display output. You will need to connect the decoder to a 7-segment display, which can display the numbers 0-9 as well as some letters.\n4. Use additional logic gates to control which output is displayed on the 7-segment display based on whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. For example, if the count is a multiple of 3, you can display \"F\" on the leftmost segment of the display, and if it is a multiple of 5, you can display \"B\" on the rightmost segment. If it is a multiple of both, you can display \"FB\" on the display.\n\nHere's a high-level diagram of what the circuit might look like:\n```lua\n+-------+      +-----+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------+\n+-------+      +-----+       |\n                 |           |\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n                                     |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |  7-segment\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+  display\n                 |                    |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n                                     |\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n                 |           |       |\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\n                                     |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\n```\nIn this diagram, the 74161 counter is connected to three AND gates, each of which checks whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or 15 (i.e., both 3 and 5). The outputs of these AND gates are connected to additional AND gates, which control which output"

As they navigate the dangers of the galaxy, they discover new worlds and meet interesting characters along the way. But with their resources dwindling and the threat of the aliens still looming, they must find a way to survive and ensure that humanity lives on.\n\nCharacters:\n\n1. David (Lead): An average, middle-aged man with no real aspirations. He's a bit of a pessimist and never thought he'd leave Earth, let alone be one of the last two humans alive. He's not a natural leader, but he's resourceful and has a dry sense of humor that he uses to keep Raj's spirits up.\n2. Raj (Supporting): David's best friend and the complete opposite of him. He's an optimist who sees the adventure in their situation and tries to make the best of it. He's more physically capable than David and takes charge when necessary.\n3. Zara (Antagonist): The leader of the alien race that destroyed Earth. She's cold and calculated, with no regard for human life. She sees the humans as nothing more than pests and wants to exterminate them all.\n4. Nova (Love Interest): A human woman that David and Raj meet on one of their journeys. She's strong and independent, but also kind and compassionate. She's the polar opposite of Zara, and David finds himself falling for her.\n\nSetting:\n\nThe film takes place in space, on various planets and spacecraft. The visuals are awe-inspiring, with beautiful landscapes and alien architecture. The film also explores the desolate nature of space, with its harsh conditions and endless emptiness.\n\nDialogue:\n\nDavid: \"I always thought I'd die in my sleep or something, not be one of the last two people alive.\"\n\nRaj: \"Hey, look on the bright side. We're exploring the galaxy! How many people can say that?\"\n\nDavid: \"Exploring the galaxy with limited supplies and no clear destination. Yeah, I'm living the dream.\"\n\nZara: \"You humans are so predictable. You'll fight to survive until the bitter end, but it won't matter. We will win in the end.\"\n\nNova: \"I'm not going to lie, I'm scared too. But I believe that we can find a way to make it through this. Together.\"\n\nNarrative:\n\nThe film opens with David and Raj frantically trying to get onto a spacecraft, seconds before Earth is destroyed by the alien race. They manage to make it on board and escape, but find themselves stranded in space with no clear direction. They use their resources to try and make contact with other humans, but to no avail.\n\nAs they journey through space, they encounter different worlds and meet a variety of characters. They face challenges such as running low on supplies, encountering dangerous creatures, and avoiding the aliens who destroyed Earth. Along the way, David starts to develop feelings for Nova, a woman they meet on one of the planets.\n\nAs they continue their journey, they discover that the aliens have a weakness - a rare mineral that can be used to destroy their ships. They set out to find the mineral, with Zara and her forces hot on their heels. After a tense battle, they manage to acquire the mineral and use it to destroy the alien ships.\n\nThe film ends with David and Nova standing on a new planet, looking out at the stars. They've found a new home, but their journey is far from over. They vow to keep exploring the galaxy and keep humanity alive, no matter what challenges come their way."

Generate a set of uniform random numbers between 0 and 1. You can use any programming language or software to generate these random numbers.\n3. For each random number, use the inverse transform method to generate a sample from the exponential distribution. The formula for the inverse transform method is:\n\nX = -ln(1 - U) / lambda\n\nwhere U is the uniform random number and X is the sample time.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each random number to generate a set of sample times.\n\nHere's some Python code to generate a set of 100 sample times:\n```makefile\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set the mean wait time\nmean_wait_time = 2\n\n# Calculate lambda\nlambda_val = 1 / mean_wait_time\n\n# Generate 100 uniform random numbers\nu = np.random.rand(100)\n\n# Use the inverse transform method to generate sample times\nsample_times = -np.log(1 - u) / lambda_val\n\nprint(sample_times)\n```\nThis code generates a set of 100 sample times and prints them to the console.

Create a CloudWatch dashboard: Once the Lambda function is set up and running, you can create a CloudWatch dashboard to display the real-time data. Choose the metrics you want to display (e.g., pageviews, sessions) and create a graph or other visual representation of the data.\n5. Schedule the Lambda function: To update the data in real-time, you can schedule the Lambda function to run at regular intervals (e.g., every minute). This will ensure that the CloudWatch dashboard always displays the latest data.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to display the real-time Google Analytics visits data on your AWS CloudWatch dashboard."

Here's an example of how to get the current location of a device using Python:\n\n1. Geopy Module:\nThe `geopy` module is a Python library that allows you to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the world using various APIs such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and more.\n\nYou can install it via pip command:\n```\npip install geopy\n```\nHere is an example of how to use Geopy module to get real-time location:\n```python\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\nimport time\n\ngeolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"geoapiExercises\")\n\nwhile True:\n    location = geolocator.geocode(\"my location\")\n    print((location.latitude, location.longitude))\n    time.sleep(10) # Sleep for 10 seconds before repeating the loop\n```\nNote: replace \"my location\" with your current address or city.\n\n2. Google Maps API:\nGoogle Maps provides a web service that allows you to retrieve the current location of a device using its latitude and longitude. You can make use of this API to get the current location in real-time.\n\nTo use Google Maps API you need to create an API key from the Google Cloud Console and then install `requests` module to make API requests. You can install it via pip command:\n```\npip install requests\n```\nHere's an example of how to get the real-time location of a device using the Google Maps API:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport time\n\nwhile True:\n    url = \"https://www.googleapis.com/geolocation/v1/geolocate?key=YOUR_API_KEY\"\n    response = requests.post(url)\n    data = json.loads(response.text)\n    lat = data[\"location\"][\"lat\"]\n    lng = data[\"location\"][\"lng\"]\n    print(lat, lng)\n    time.sleep(10) # Sleep for 10 seconds before repeating the loop\n```\nNote: replace \"YOUR\\_API\\_KEY\" with your Google Maps API key.\n\nThere are also other libraries such as `geocoder` and `pygeocoder` which can be used for getting the real-time location."

Image-based property search: With a large dataset of images, machine learning algorithms could be trained to perform image-based property search, allowing users to search for properties based on visual features such as architectural style, interior design, or location features.\n3. Image-based property analysis: The dataset could also be used to analyze and compare properties based on various visual features, such as square footage, room count, and overall condition. This could provide valuable insights for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers.\n4. Improved virtual tours: The dataset could be used to create more immersive and interactive virtual tours of properties, allowing potential buyers to get a better feel for a property without physically visiting it.\n\nOverall, a dataset of real estate property images could provide new and innovative ways to present, search, and analyze properties, which could ultimately lead to a better experience for real estate buyers and sellers."

The United States saw this as a direct threat to their national security and demanded that the Soviet Union remove the missiles. After a tense standoff, the Soviet Union eventually agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a US promise not to invade Cuba and the removal of US missiles from Turkey.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis was important because it was the closest the world ever came to nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. It demonstrated the dangers of nuclear weapons and the potential consequences of political brinksmanship. The crisis also showed the importance of diplomacy and communication in preventing war, as both sides were able to reach a peaceful resolution through negotiation.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis led to several significant developments in international relations, including the establishment of a direct communication hotline between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union to prevent miscommunications and misunderstandings. The crisis also helped to reduce tensions between the two superpowers, leading to the signing of several arms control agreements in the following years.\n\nOverall, the Cuban Missile Crisis was a turning point in the Cold War, demonstrating the need for diplomacy and the importance of avoiding nuclear conflict."

During the height of the battle, Arya Stark faces off against the Night King, successfully landing a fatal blow, shattering him into a thousand shards of ice. The army of the dead falls as their master perishes.\n\nIn the aftermath, the surviving forces turn their attention to Cersei, who has barricaded herself in the Red Keep. Daenerys, now certain of her destiny, leads her remaining dragon, Drogon, to the Red Keep. They breach the defenses, and Daenerys confronts Cersei. Cersei, defiant to the end, refuses to surrender, and Daenerys executes her with dragonfire.\n\nWith the war over, Westeros needs a new ruler. Jon Snow, revealed as Aegon Targaryen, has the rightful claim to the Iron Throne. However, he renounces it, believing that the cycle of destruction and tyranny must end. He suggests a great council to determine the future of the realm. The council, comprised of the surviving leaders, decide that the best path forward is to establish a new form of government where the ruler is chosen by merit and not bloodline.\n\nTyrion Lannister, wise and experienced, is selected as the first ruler of this new Westeros, with Sansa Stark and Daenerys Targaryen serving as his advisors. The Iron Throne is melted down, symbolizing the end of an era and the dawn of a new, more just future for the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nArya, having avenged her family and saved Westeros, sets sail to explore the uncharted lands west of the continent. Bran Stark, now the Three-Eyed Raven, returns to the cave of the Children of the Forest to continue learning from them and protect the realm from future threats. Jon Snow, still burdened by his Targaryen heritage, heads north to live out his days with the Free Folk, finding peace and purpose in his life among those who accepted him as he was.\n\nThe story of the Seven Kingdoms concludes with hope and renewal, as the characters we have come to know and love forge new paths for themselves and the realm they fought so hard to save."

In a skirmish miniatures game, Jason Voorhees could be turned into a hero with unique abilities and powers. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Unstoppable Force: Jason is known for his persistence and ability to keep coming back, no matter how much damage he takes. This could translate to an ability that allows him to ignore certain types of damage or to regenerate health over time.\n2. Brutal Melee Combat: Jason is a formidable fighter in close combat, using his machete and other weapons to devastating effect. He could have high melee combat stats, and possibly a special ability that allows him to strike multiple opponents in a single attack.\n3. Stealth and Ambush: Jason is known for his ability to sneak up on his victims and take them by surprise. He could have an ability that allows him to move quickly and silently, or to set traps for his opponents.\n4. Fear Aura: Jason's terrifying presence could have an effect on his opponents, making them more likely to flee or make mistakes in combat. He could have an ability that causes nearby enemies to become shaken or lose their nerve.\n5. Undying Loyalty: Jason is often portrayed as a silent, unyielding force of nature, driven by a singular purpose. He could have an ability that makes him immune to mind control or other forms of mental manipulation, or that allows him to automatically pass certain types of morale tests.\n\nThese are just a few ideas for how Jason Voorhees could be translated into a hero in a skirmish miniatures game. Ultimately, the specific abilities and powers he would have would depend on the game mechanics and the designer's vision for the character."

It works by mapping each key to a position on the ring using a hash function, and then assigning the key to the closest node in a clockwise direction.\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement a hashring in TypeScript:\n```\nclass HashRing {\n  private nodes: string[];\n  private ring: { [key: string]: string };\n  private replicas: number;\n\n  constructor(nodes: string[], replicas: number) {\n    this.nodes = nodes;\n    this.replicas = replicas;\n    this.ring = {};\n\n    // Create a hash for each node and add it to the ring\n    for (const node of nodes) {\n      for (let i = 0; i < replicas; i++) {\n        const hash = hashFunction(node + ':' + i);\n        this.ring[hash] = node;\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Sort the keys in the ring to ensure that they are in clockwise order\n    this.sortedKeys = Object.keys(this.ring).sort();\n  }\n\n  // Get the node responsible for a given key\n  getNode(key: string): string {\n    const hash = hashFunction(key);\n    const keys = this.sortedKeys;\n\n    // Find the first node with a position greater than the hash\n    let index = keys.findIndex((k) => k > hash);\n\n    // If no such node is found, the key belongs on the first node\n    if (index === -1) {\n      index = 0;\n    }\n\n    return this.ring[keys[index]];\n  }\n}\n\nfunction hashFunction(str: string): string {\n  // A simple hash function that converts a string to a 32-bit integer and then\n  // returns it as a hexadecimal string\n  let hash = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {\n    hash = (hash << 5) + hash + str.charCodeAt(i);\n    hash = hash & hash; // Convert to 32-bit integer\n    hash = Math.abs(hash);\n  }\n  return hash.toString(16);\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!

These could include changes in the market, economic conditions, competitors, regulatory environment, and so on. Next, you assess the internal weaknesses and strengths of your organization, including resources, capabilities, and processes.\n\nWith this information in hand, you can then develop strategies that take advantage of opportunities, mitigate threats, and leverage your strengths while addressing your weaknesses. For example, if you identify a new market opportunity, you might develop a marketing campaign to target that market. If you identify a weakness in your production process, you might invest in new equipment or training to improve efficiency.\n\nOverall, the goal of TOWS is to help organizations better understand their environment and develop strategies that will enable them to achieve their goals and succeed in the long term."

        "value": "S:\nThe proposed changes\nJudicial selection\nCurrent system\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members. Three of them are Supreme Court judges, two are representatives of the Bar Association, two are Knesset members and two are ministers.[26] Selection of judges to all courts require a simple majority of the Committee, but selection of Supreme Court judges require the approval of 7 out of the 9 members on the Committee, granting essentially veto powers to either the three judges or the representatives of the ruling Parliamentary coalition. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the effect of the current system is one of consensus, in that \"the selection of Supreme Court justices has mandated the consent of the politicians on the [Committee], because a majority of seven of its nine members must support a successful candidate. By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee. This principle has generally produced a consensus on a slate of new justices.\"[27] In contrast, those who view the current Supreme Court as left-leaning, including Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and Prime Minister Netanyahu, state that this 'consensus' is one-sided: When a right-wing government is in place, its members must compromise with the allegedly left-leaning committee members (the 3 Supreme Court justices and the Bar representatives who, it is claimed by Levin, vote as a block), but when a left-wing government is in charge, supposedly no such consensus is needed. They point to the recent appointment of 61 judges in one sitting of the committee, under the previous center-left government, with no effective way for the opposition to object.[28][29][30]\n\nProposed system\nAccording to the amendments proposed to the Judiciary Basic Law by Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, the Judicial Selection Committee's composition will be changed to give greater weight to the legislative and executive branches of government. The Committee will consist of eleven members, namely the Minister of Justice who will serve as the Committee Chairman, two Ministers designated by the government, the Chairman of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, the Chairman of the Knesset State Control Committee, the Chairman of the Knesset Committee, the President of the Supreme Court, two other judges of the Supreme Court who will be chosen from their fellow judges, and two public representatives chosen by the Minister of Justice, one of them being a lawyer.[31] As a result, since the committee chairmen are usually (though not always) selected from the ranks of the ruling coalition, the government could have complete control over the appointment and dismissal of judges, with seven representatives on the Committee out of eleven members in total.\n\nArguments in favor of the reform\nArguments put forward to justify this change include the following:\n\nAs things stand, members who are not publicly elected officials — the judges and lawyers — have a majority in the Committee, and it is impossible to appoint a judge of whom they do not approve to any judicature. Furthermore, it is alleged that the Supreme Court's representatives generally vote in a coordinated manner, and this causes the judiciary's representatives to negotiate with the other Committee members as one unit, with increased negotiating power.[31]\nComparatively, focusing exclusively on the Supreme Court, Israeli judicial selection is exceptional when contrasted with other democratic countries. A 2019 study of judicial appointments to constitutional courts of the 36 OECD countries (supreme courts or constitutional courts) found that 24 out of 36 countries surveyed appoint their judges in a system that grants the power to elected officials exclusively.[32] For example, in the United States, supreme court judges are appointed by the president, with the confirmation of the Senate; in Germany, constitutional court judges are appointed by both chambers of the legislature; in France, the judges of the constitutional council are appointed by the President and both houses of representatives in equal proportion, and alongside them serve former state presidents; in Japan, the selection is controlled by the government subject to ratification through a referendum. This system of exclusive appointment of judges by the elected officials is common to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Norway and more. It must be stated that in Israel, such a system was used during the state's early years and that the judges that established the Supreme Court were appointed by the government with the Knesset's approval.\nOnly four OECD member states, besides Israel, appoint their constitutional court judges without giving the elected officials the ability to appoint the judges: Turkey, Greece, the UK and Luxembourg. However, the UK and Luxembourg are distinct from Israel and most other states in that their judges cannot void parliament's laws, and that the supremacy of the public's values are attained by legislative supremacy. From this, of the 36 OECD countries, Israel's sole companions in giving a veto to non-elected officials over judicial appointed to the highest tribunal authorized to strike down parliament's laws, are Greece and Turkey.[33][32]\nOf the 50 states that comprise the United States, in 22 states, the supreme court judges are elected directly by voting ballot; in another 15 states, the appointments are ratified in a direct vote; four states elect their judges through the public officials and eight states appoint by committees in which the majority of the members are appointed by elected officials.[32]\nArguments against the reform\nThe Kohelet Policy Forum study[32] used to underpin most of the above arguments has been strongly criticized as being selective in its reliance on foreign legal systems. For example:\n\nWhile 31 of the 36 countries in the study have public representatives selecting the judges, in 24 of them, judges are selected in consultation with the judicial system and upon its recommendation.\nFurther, while in most of these countries such a recommendation carries no legal force, in practice it is binding, as the public representatives listen to the judges' recommendations and act upon them. As noted in a study, \"the political culture in these countries is such that public representatives select the judges with the consent and blessing of the judicial system — a political culture completely different than that in Israel.\"[34]\nThe same study notes: \"The other developed countries, in which there is no appreciable involvement of the justice system in judicial selection, are almost all countries with constitutions. Some have a federal structure of several states, each with its own additional supreme court protecting the residents of that federal state. Most have bicameral legislatures not necessarily controlled by the party controlling the executive branch, and so the government's power is decentralized. Usually judicial selection requires the consent of the government as well as both houses of parliament, and almost always the choice in the legislative chambers requires a large majority (usually two thirds of the votes, and even an absolute majority). In other words, the coalition, which does not rule alone and cannot appoint judges on its own, needs the consent of the opposition as well. None of this exists in Israel, and that completely changes the picture.\"[35]\nThe proposed changes would also grant the government complete control in appointing judges to all courts other than the Supreme Court. The justification for changing the manner of appointing judges to courts other than the Supreme Court is unclear.\nIn addition, the Knesset's Research Unit,[36] in a survey, also presented a very different picture, quoting an OECD report[37] arguing that on the purposes promoted by most democracies is to prevent any single power control over judicial appointment of constitutional court justices.\n\nThe Israeli Law Professors Forum for Democracy, comprising over 100 legal experts and academics in Israel,[38] has published a number of position papers analyzing these reforms, concluding that their implementation would undermine the judiciary's \"independence, subordinate the judiciary to the elected government, and render the separation of powers in Israel an empty shell\".[39]\n\nAccording to Prof. Elise Brezis, director of the Azrieli Center for Economic Policy at Bar-Ilan University, the Kohelet Policy Forum did not attempt to assess the impact their plan will have on the Israeli economy. She compared the plan to a \"pretty architectural sketch with no engineering assessment.\"[40]"

Then, we'll implement the bot features as described.\n\n**Project Structure:**\n```lua\nmy-discord-bot/\n├── commands/\n│   ├── general/\n│   └── moderation/\n├── config/\n│   ├── config.json\n│   └── db-config.json\n├── events/\n│   ├── guildCreate.js\n│   └── guildDelete.js\n├── utils/\n│   └── database.js\n├── index.js\n└── package.json\n```\n**1. Set up the project:**\n\nCreate a new folder named `my-discord-bot` and navigate to it. Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install discord.js mysql2 dotenv\n```\n**2. Configure the bot:**\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the root folder to store your bot token:\n```makefile\nBOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\n```\nCreate a `config/config.json` file to store bot configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"prefix\": \"!\",\n  \"ownerId\": \"YOUR_OWNER_ID\"\n}\n```\nCreate a `config/db-config.json` file to store database configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"host\": \"localhost\",\n  \"user\": \"your_user\",\n  \"password\": \"your_password\",\n  \"database\": \"your_database\"\n}\n```\n**3. Implement the bot features:**\n\nCreate the `index.js` file in the root folder:\n```javascript\nrequire('dotenv').config();\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst { Client, Collection, Intents } = require('discord.js');\nconst config = require('./config/config.json');\n\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.Guilds, Intents.FLAGS.GuildMessages, Intents.FLAGS.GuildMembers] });\n\nclient.commands = new Collection();\nconst commandFolders = fs.readdirSync('./commands');\nfor (const folder of commandFolders) {\n  const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(`./commands/${folder}`).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));\n  for (const file of commandFiles) {\n    const command = require(`./commands/${folder}/${file}`);\n    client.commands.set(command.name, command);\n  }\n}\n\nconst eventFiles = fs.readdirSync('./events').filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));\nfor (const file of eventFiles) {\n  const event = require(`./events/${file}`);\n  const eventName = file.split('.')[0];\n  client.on(eventName, event.bind(null, client));\n}\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async message => {\n  if (!message.content.startsWith(config.prefix) || message.author.bot) return;\n\n  const args = message.content.slice(config.prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/);\n  const commandName = args.shift().toLowerCase();\n\n  const command = client.commands.get(commandName) || client.commands.find(cmd => cmd.aliases && cmd.aliases.includes(commandName));\n\n  if (!command) return;\n\n  try {\n    await command.execute(message, args);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n    message.reply('There was an error trying to execute that command!');\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);\n```\n**4. Implement commands and events:**\n\nCreate general and moderation commands in the `commands/general` and `commands/moderation` folders, respectively. For example, `commands/general/ping.js`:\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  name: 'ping',\n  description: 'Ping the bot.',\n  async execute(message) {\n    const msg = await message.reply('P\n```"

She is highly regarded for her ability to infuse quality service and enrich the sense of community within senior living facilities, leading to improved occupancy, reduced staff turnover, higher quality care, and improved bottom lines.\n\nOne of Jean's key philosophies is the importance of building a strong bond with prospective families from the very beginning, starting with the initial phone call and continuing through the move-in process and post-care. She understands that this kind of personalized attention and communication is essential for creating a positive and supportive environment for both seniors and their families.\n\nAccording to research, the power of families receiving regular, positive updates about their loved ones in senior living facilities cannot be overstated. In a study published in the Journal of Gerontological Nursing, researchers found that regular communication with family members was associated with higher levels of satisfaction and perceived quality of care among seniors living in assisted living facilities. This is just one example of the many ways in which effective communication and care can have a lasting, positive impact on both seniors and their families.\n\nOne senior living manager who has worked with Jean had this to say about her service: \"Jean has been an invaluable asset to our team. Her expertise in building relationships with families and creating a sense of community within our facility has helped to improve occupancy, reduce staff turnover, and increase overall satisfaction among our residents and their families. She is truly a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend her services to any senior living facility looking to enhance their quality of care and sense of community.\"\n\nA family member of a senior living in a facility where Jean has provided her services had this to say about the quality of communication and care: \"From the moment we first contacted Jean, we felt a sense of warmth and compassion. She took the time to really listen to our concerns and answered all of our questions with patience and understanding. She has been a constant source of support and guidance for us, keeping us informed about our loved one's care and ensuring that their needs are being met. We feel so grateful to have Jean as a part of our loved one's care team and can't thank her enough for all that she has done for us.\"\n\nJean practices seven core principles in her work, which can be found in the following video link: [insert link here]. These principles are centered on creating a sense of community, building strong relationships, and providing exceptional care and support to seniors and their families. By following these principles, Jean has been able to make a positive difference in the lives of countless seniors and their families, and we have no doubt that she will continue to do so for many years to come."

For example, genetic testing for depression is not widely available, and access to testing is often limited by cost and availability. Furthermore, the scientific understanding of the relationship between genetics and depression is still developing, and the accuracy and usefulness of genetic testing for depression are still being evaluated. As a result, the use of genetic testing for depression is limited, and patients may not have access to the full range of genetic testing services that could potentially benefit them.\n\nFuture State: The future state of the use of genetic testing for depression is characterized by improved access to testing, greater scientific understanding of the relationship between genetics and depression, and more effective use of genetic information in treatment planning. In the future, genetic testing for depression may become more widely available and covered by insurance, and patients may have access to a range of testing options, including predictive testing and testing for specific genetic markers.\n\nThe difference between the current and future state supports the need for change in the use of genetic testing for depression. The current limitations in access to testing, combined with a lack of scientific understanding, limit the potential benefits of genetic testing for patients. By improving access to testing and advancing the scientific understanding of the relationship between genetics and depression, it may be possible to maximize the benefits of genetic testing for patients and improve the quality of care for individuals with depression.\n\nData to support the need for change include studies demonstrating the potential benefits of genetic testing for depression, such as improved treatment outcomes and increased patient satisfaction. For example, a study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that patients who received genetic testing for depression reported greater understanding of their condition and increased satisfaction with their treatment, compared to patients who did not receive testing. Additionally, data from research on the genetics of depression may support the need for genetic testing, as it may provide insight into the underlying causes of depression and inform the development of new, more effective treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, the gap analysis of the use of genetic testing for depression supports the need for change, as the current limitations in access to testing and scientific understanding limit the potential benefits of genetic testing for patients. Improving access to testing and advancing the scientific understanding of the relationship between genetics and depression is critical for maximizing the benefits of genetic testing for individuals with depression."

Identify the key features and functions of your app: The first step in designing an intuitive navigation system is to identify the key features and functions of your app. This will help you to determine what should be included in your navigation menu and how the different sections of your app should be organized.\n2. Develop a user flow: A user flow is a visual representation of how users navigate through your app. It maps out the different screens and actions that users will encounter as they move through the app. Developing a user flow can help you to identify any potential navigation issues and ensure that users can easily access the features they need.\n3. Use a simple and consistent navigation structure: A simple and consistent navigation structure is key to creating an intuitive navigation system. Use clear and descriptive labels for your navigation items, and organize them in a logical and consistent way. Avoid using too many levels of hierarchy or too many menu items, as this can overwhelm users and make it difficult to find what they are looking for.\n4. Include a search function: Including a search function in your app can help users to quickly find the content they need. Make sure that the search function is easy to find and use, and that it returns accurate and relevant results.\n5. Test and iterate: Once you have designed your navigation system, it’s important to test it with real users to see how it performs in practice. Conduct user testing sessions to get feedback on your navigation system, and use this feedback to make improvements and iterate on your design.\n6. Use visual cues: Visual cues can help to guide users through your app and make it easier to navigate. Use icons, colors, and other visual elements to highlight important features and functions, and to provide feedback to users about where they are in the app.\nBy following these steps, you can create an intuitive navigation system for your mobile app that will make it easy and enjoyable for users to find the content they need."

According to the text, transformers have largely replaced traditional models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in mainstream NLP. In the field of clinical data, transformers have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis and decision-making.\n\nThere are several significant benefits that transformer language models have over traditional models. One of these benefits is the ability to process large volumes of clinical data while retaining context, leading to improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models. This is due to the self-attention mechanism, which enables a better understanding of the relationships between data, allowing for accurate predictions even with a large amount of data.\n\nIn addition to this, transformer language models have faster training times than RNNs, due to the parallelization method. This allows for substantially higher parallelization and takes much less time to train. Transformer language models have also been shown to outperform traditional language models in terms of accuracy.\n\nAnother benefit of transformer language models is their increased flexibility. They are able to handle different types of data (such as images and text) and tasks (such as classification and generation). This makes them more versatile and applicable to a wider range of problems.\n\nTransformers are also easier to interpret, making it easier to understand how the model works and what it has learned. This increased interpretability is a significant advantage, as it allows for more transparency in the decision-making process.\n\nFinally, transformer language models are more efficient, requiring less training data and computational resources. This makes them an attractive choice for many NLP tasks.\n\nIn summary, transformers have achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) translation quality, outperforming other models. They offer a number of significant benefits over traditional language models, including the ability to process large volumes of data, faster training times, increased accuracy, flexibility, interpretability, and efficiency. These advantages make transformers a powerful tool for NLP tasks, particularly in the field of clinical data analysis and decision-making."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "To create a dynamic student feedback form using `useContext` in React, you first need to set up a context provider that will hold the state and functions for managing the form data. Here is an example:\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useContext } from \"react\";\n\n// Create a new context\nconst FeedbackContext = React.createContext();\n\n// Create a provider component that will hold the state and functions for managing the form data\nconst FeedbackProvider = ({ children }) => {\n  const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(\"\");\n\n  const updateName = (name) => {\n    setName(name);\n  };\n\n  const updateEmail = (email) => {\n    setEmail(email);\n  };\n\n  const updateFeedback = (feedback) => {\n    setFeedback(feedback);\n  };\n\n  const resetForm = () => {\n    setName(\"\");\n    setEmail(\"\");\n    setFeedback(\"\");\n  };\n\n  // Create an object that holds the state and functions that we want to share with other components\n  const feedbackState = {\n    name,\n    email,\n    feedback,\n    updateName,\n    updateEmail,\n    updateFeedback,\n    resetForm,\n  };\n\n  // Pass the feedbackState object to the context provider\n  return (\n    <FeedbackContext.Provider value={feedbackState}>\n      {children}\n    </FeedbackContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n\n// Create a custom hook that allows us to easily access the feedback state and functions from other components\nconst useFeedback = () => {\n  const feedbackState = useContext(FeedbackContext);\n  return feedbackState;\n};\n\nexport { FeedbackProvider, useFeedback };\n```\nIn the above code, we create a `FeedbackContext` using the `React.createContext()` method. We then create a `FeedbackProvider` component that holds the state and functions for managing the form data. This provider component takes in `children` as a prop, which represents the child components that will have access to the context.\n\nInside the `FeedbackProvider` component, we create state variables for the name, email, and feedback fields of the form. We also define functions for updating these fields and for resetting the form.\n\nWe then create an object called `feedbackState` that holds the state variables and functions that we want to share with other components. We pass this object to the context provider using the `value` prop.\n\nFinally, we create a custom hook called `useFeedback` that allows other components to easily access the `feedbackState` object. This hook uses the `useContext` hook to retrieve the context and return the `feedbackState` object.\n\nNow that we have set up the context provider and custom hook, we can use them in other components to create the dynamic student feedback form. Here is an example component that uses the `useFeedback` hook:\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { useFeedback } from \"./FeedbackContext\";\n\nconst FeedbackForm = () => {\n  const {\n    name,\n    email,\n    feedback,\n    updateName,\n    updateEmail,\n    updateFeedback,\n    resetForm,\n  } = useFeedback();\n\n  const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    // Do something with the form data (e.g. submit it to a server)\n    resetForm();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name:</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        id=\"name\"\n        value={name}\n        onChange={(e) => updateName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email:</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        id=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) =>\n```"

Eko has started working with Food Panda on their CNY riders' engagement program. The program aims to remunerate Panda riders and Food Panda has a team of that. Eko will be entering via servicing packages and supplying riders with programs and better rates. We are aiming for a more long term partnership and their team is aligned with the same goal.\n\nOn our last meeting with their riders' engagement & partnership team we've also introduced FBX entity and the possibility of having FBX having an affiliate program for the riders to seamlessly sign up for panda through our app with a referral incentive to us. The idea is pre-mature but doable in approval pov. We can also think about how to offer new and re-loans to their rider (can be walker, e-bike or motorbike) community via upgrades, trade-ins, new purchases.\n\nIn the shorter execution, I pitched that on their upcoming event this 30th Jan they can consider sponsoring their riders who have fulfilled certain trips upon onboarding and paying (partial) of their monthly installment on their behalf. Giving us a list of details that we minimally need to map to our customers and with a 5-7 days processing time. So onboard the riders on Eko end and partner with FBX for riders' incentive.\n\nWe're in the discussion phase and will iron out the details before finalizing. I look at this as a method to solve payment collection problems, benefit Eko & Panda and at the same time ideally if we can succeed in small campaigns like this we can move on to longer term partnerships; exist within the Panda community."

Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a medium-sized heatproof bowl.\n2. Stir in the lemon juice.\n3. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.\n4. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 170°F (77°C).\n5. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and stir in the butter, one piece at a time, until fully incorporated.\n6. Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean container.\n7. Let it cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until chilled.\n\nThis recipe makes about 2 cups of lemon curd. You can use it as a spread on toast or scones, as a filling for cakes or tarts, or as a topping for ice cream or yogurt. Enjoy!"

Here is a sample story based on the outline you provided:\n\nIntroduction:\nIt was a beautiful day at the golf course, with the sun shining brightly and a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the trees. John, an elderly golfer, stood on the first tee, preparing to tee off for what would be the best round of his life. John had been playing golf for over 50 years, and had won numerous club championships and local tournaments. However, in recent years, his game had started to decline due to age and a series of injuries. Despite this, John still loved the game and continued to play as often as he could.\n\nRising action:\nJohn started off strong, hitting a solid drive down the fairway. He followed it up with a precise approach shot that landed within ten feet of the hole. John sank the putt for a birdie, and he knew that this was going to be a special round. He continued to play well on the next few holes, making a few more birdies and only dropping a shot on one hole. As he made the turn, John was tied for the lead with the current club champion.\n\nClimax:\nAs John began the back nine, he faced his toughest test yet - a long par-5 with a narrow fairway and a tricky green. John hit a perfect drive and then a solid second shot that left him with a downhill lie for his approach. John's hands were shaking as he lined up the shot, but he trusted in his swing and took a deep breath. The ball soared through the air, landing softly on the green and rolling towards the flagstick. John couldn't believe his eyes as the ball dropped into the hole for an eagle.\n\nFalling action:\nJohn was on fire now, and he continued to play some of the best golf of his life on the final holes. He made another birdie on the par-3 16th, and then parred the last two holes to finish with a score of 67, a new personal best for him.\n\nConclusion:\nAs John walked off the course, he was beaming with pride and happiness. He had just played the best round of his life, and he couldn't wait to tell his friends and family about it. John knew that this round would be a highlight of his golfing career, and he felt grateful and blessed to have experienced it. He also realized that age was just a number, and that with hard work and determination, he could still achieve his goals on the golf course."

It can be as simple as going for a walk or jog, practicing yoga, or joining a fitness class.\n3. Connect with others: Call a friend or family member, meet new people through a social group, or volunteer for a cause you care about. Connecting with others can provide social support and reduce feelings of boredom.\n4. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you focus on the present moment and reduce the urge for impulsive spending.\n5. Plan ahead: Create a schedule or list of activities to do when you feel bored. This can include things like reading a book, cooking a meal, or doing a puzzle. Having a plan can help reduce the urge for impulsive spending.\n6. Set a budget: If you do feel the urge to spend, set a budget for yourself and stick to it. This can help you make more intentional and thoughtful purchasing decisions.\n\nRemember that overcoming an addiction takes time and effort, and it's okay to seek support from a therapist or support group if needed."

It was another busy day beginning. \n But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath, forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers ruffled, he stalled and fell. \n Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for them disgraced and it is dishonor. \n But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in that trembling hard curve - slowing, slowing, and stalling once more - was no ordinary bird. \n Most gulls didn't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight ­how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly. \n This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting. \n He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were very much dismayed indeed. \nWhy, Jon, why?\" his mother asked. \"Why is it so hard to be like the rest of the flock, Jon? Why can't you leave low flying to the pelicans, the albatross? \n\"I don't mind being bone and feathers, Mum. I just want to know what I can do in the air and what I can't, that's all. I just want to know.\" \n\"See here, Jonathan,\" said his father, not unkindly. \"Winter isn't far away. Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep. If you must study,. then study food, and how to get it. This flying business is all very well, but you can't eat a glide, you know. Don't you forget that the reason you fly is to eat.\"\n Jonathan nodded obediently. For the next few days he tried to be behave like the other gulls; he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he couldn't make it work. \nIt's all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a hard-won anchovy to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could be spending all this time learning to fly. There's so much to learn! \nIt wasn't long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself again, far out at see, hungry, happy, learning. \n The subject was speed, and in a week's practice he learned more about speed than the fastest gull alive. \n From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls don't make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing goes unstable on the upstroke. \n Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working at the very peak of his ability, he lost control at high speed. \n Climb to a thousand feet. Full power straight ahead first, then push over, flapping, to a vertical dive. Then, every time, his left wing stalled on an upstroke, he'd roll violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right. \n He couldn't be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \n They key, he thought as last, dripping wet, must be to hold the wings still \n From two thousand feet he tried again, rolling into his dive, beak straight down, wings full out and stable from the moment he passed fifty miles per hour. It took tremendous strength, but it worked. In ten seconds he has blurred through ninety miles per hour. Jonathan had set a world speed record for seagulls!\n But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his pullout, the instant he changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite. Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea. \n When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated in moonlight on the surface of the ocean. His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight could be just enough to drag him gently down to the bottom, and end it all. \n As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him. There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have a falcon's short wings, and live on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull. \n The voice faded, and Jonathan agreed. The place for a seagull at night is on shore, and from this moment forth, he vowed, he would be a normal gull. It would make everyone happier. \n He pushed wearily away from the dark water and flew toward the land, grateful for what he had learned about work-saving low-altitude flying. \n But no, he thought. I am done with the way I was, I am done with everything I learned. I am a seagull like every other seagull, and I will fly like one. So he climbed painfully to a hundred feet and flapped his wings harder, pressing for shore. \n He felt better for his decision to be just another one of the flock. there would be no ties now to the force that had driven him to learn, there would be no more challenge and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop thinking, and fly through the dark, toward the lights above the beach. \nDark! The hollow voice cracked in alarm. Seagulls never fly in the dark!\n Jonathan was not alert enough to listen. It's pretty, he thought. The moon and the lights twinkling on the water, throwing out little beacon-trails though the \n Get Down! Seagulls never fly in the dark! If you were meant to fly in the dark, you'd have the eyes f an owl! You'd have charts for brains! You'd have a falcon's short wings!\n There in the night, a hundred feet in the air, Jonathan Livingston Seagull ­blinked. His pain, his resolutions, vanished. \n Short Wings. A falcon's short wings!\n That's the answer! What a fool I've been! All I need is a tiny little wing, all I need is to fold most of my wings and fly on just the tips alone! Short wings!\n He climbed two thousand feet above the black sea, and without a moment for thought of failure and death, he brought his forewings tightly in to his body, left only the narrow swept daggers of his wingtips extended into the wind, and fell into a vertical dive. \n The wind was a monster roar at his head. Seventy miles per hour, ninety, a hundred and twenty and faster still. The wing-strain now at a hundred and forty miles per hour wasn't nearly as hard as it had been before at seventy, and with the faintest twist of his wingtips he eased out of the dive and shot above the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon. \n He closed his eyes to slits against the wind and rejoiced. A hundred forty miles per hour! and under control! If I dive from five thousand feet instead of two thousand, I wonder how fast... \n His vows of a moment before were forgotten, swept away in that great swift wind. Yet he felt guiltless, breaking the promises he had made himself. Such promises are only for the gulls that accept the ordinary. One who has touched excellence in his learning has no need of that kind of promise. \n By sunup, Jonathan Gull was practicing again. From five thousand feet the fishing boats were specks in the flat blue water, Breakfast Flock was a faint cloud of dust motes, circling. \n He was alive, trembling ever so slightly with delight, proud that his fear was under control. Then without ceremony he hugged in his forewings, extended his short, angled wingtips, and plunged directly toward the sea. By the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity, the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no faster. He was flying now straight down, at two hundred fourteen miles per hour. He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he'd be blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull. But the speed was power, and the"

The Gull of Fortune smiled upon him this once, and no one was killed. \n By the time he had pulled his beak straight up into the sky he was still scorching along at a hundred and sixty miles per hour. When he had slowed to twenty and stretched his wings again at last, the boat was a crumb on the sea, four thousand feet below. \n His thought was triumph. Terminal velocity! A seagull two hundred fourteen miles per hour! It was a breakthrough, the greatest single moment in the history of the Flock, and in that moment a new age opened for Jonathan Gull. Flying out to his lonely practice area, folding his wings for a dive from eight thousand feet, he set himself at once to discover how to turn. \nA single wingtip feather, he found, moved a fraction of an inch, gives a smooth sweeping curve at the tremendous speed. Before he learned this, however, he found that moving more than one feather at that speed will spin you like a rifle ball ... and Jonathan had flown the first aerobatics of any seagull on earth. \n He spared no time that day for talk with other gulls, but flew on past sunset. He discovered the loop, the slow roll, the point roll, the inverted spin, the gull bunt, the pinwheel. \n When Jonathan Seagull joined the Flock on the beach, it was full night. He was dizzy and terribly tired. Yet in delight he flew a loop to landing, with a snap roll just before touchdown. When they hear of it, he thought, of the Breakthrough, they'll be wild with joy. How much more there is now to living! Instead of our drab slogging forth and back to the fishing boats, there's a reason to life! We can list ourselves out of ignorance, we can find ourselves \n The years head hummed and glowed with promise. \n The gulls were flocked into the Council Gathering when he landed, and apparently had been so flocked for sometime. They were, in fact, waiting. \n\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull! Stand to Centre!\" The Elder's words sounded in a voice of highest ceremony. Stand to Centre meant only great shame or great honor. Stand to Centre for honor was the way the gulls' foremost leaders were marked. Of course, he thought, the Breakfast Flock this morning; they saw the Breakthrough! But I want no honors. I have no wish to be leader. I want only to share what I've found, to show those horizons out ahead for us all. He stepped forward. \n\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull,\" said the Elder, \"Stand to Centre for shame in the sight of your fellow gulls!\" \nIt felt like being hit with a board. His knees went weak, his feathers sagged, there was a roaring in his ears. Centered for shame? Impossible! The Breakthrough! They can't understand! They're wrong, they're wrong! \n\"...for his reckless irresponsibly,\" the solemn voice intoned, \"violating the dignity and tradition of the Gull Family...\"\n To be centered for shame meant that he would be cast out of gull society, banished to the solitary life on the Far Cliffs. \n\"...one day, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, you shall learn that irresponsibly? My brothers!\" he cried. \"Who is more responsible than a gull who finds and follows a meaning, a higher purpose for life? For a thousand years we have scrabbled after fish heads, but now we have a chance, let me show you what I've found...\"\n The Flock might as well have been stone. \n\"The Brotherhood is broken,\" the gulls intoned together, and with one accord they solemnly closed their ears and turned their backs upon him. \n Jonathan Seagull spent the rest of his days alone, but he flew way out beyond the Far Cliffs. His one sorrow was not solitude, it was that other gulls refused to believe the glory of flight that awaited them; they refused to open their eyes and see. \n He learned more each day. He learned that a streamlined high-speed dive could bring him to find the rare and tasty fish that schooled ten feet below the surface of the ocean: he no longer needed fishing boats and stale bread for survival. He learned to sleep in the air, setting a course at night across the offshore wind, covering a hundred miles from sunset to sunrise. With the same inner control, he flew through heavy sea-fogs and climbed above them into dazzling clear skies... in the very times when every other gull stood on the ground, knowing nothing but mist and rain. He learned to ride the high winds far inland, to dine there on delicate insects. \n What he had once hoped for the Flock, he now gained for himself alone; he learned to fly, and was not sorry for the price that he had paid. Jonathan Seagull discovered that boredom and fear and anger are the reasons that a gull's life is so short, and with these gone from his thought, he lived a long and fine life indeed. \n They came in the evening, then, and found Jonathan gliding peaceful and alone through his beloved sky. The two gulls that appeared at his wings were pure as starlight, and the glow from them was gentle and friendly in the high night air. But most lovely of all was the skill with which they flew, their wingtips moving a precise and constant inch from his own. \n Without a word, Jonathan put them to his test, a test that no gull had ever passed. He twisted his wings, slowed to a single mile per hour above stall. The two radiant birds slowed with him, smoothly, locked in position. They knew about slow flying. \n He folded his wings, rolled, and dropped in a dive to a hundred and ninety miles per hour. They dropped with him, streaking down in flawless formation. \n At last he turned that speed straight up into a long vertical slow-roll. The rolled with him, smiling. \n He recovered to level flight and was quiet for a time before he spoke. \"Very well,\" he said, \"who are you?\" \n\"We're from your Flock, Jonathan. We are your brothers.\" The words were strong and calm. \"We've come to take you higher, to take you home.\" \n\"Home I have none. Flock I have none. I am Outcast And we fly now at the peak of the Great Mountain Wind Beyond a few hundred feet, I can lift this old body no higher.\" \n\"But you can, Jonathan. For you have learned. One school is finished, and \n As it had shined across him all his life, so understanding lighted that moment for Jonathan Seagull. they were right. He could fly higher, and it was time to go home. \n He gave one last long look across the sky, across that magnificent silver land where he had learned so much. \n\"I'm ready,\" he said at last. \n And Jonathan Livingston Seagull rose with the two starbright gulls to disappear into a perfect dark sky."

Sola Scriptura (\"Scripture alone\"): This principle holds that the Bible is the only source of authority for Christian belief and practice, and that it is the only rule and norm for Christian faith.\nArguments for:\n* The Bible is the inspired word of God, and therefore is the ultimate authority for Christians\n* Tradition and human authority can be fallible, but the Bible is always trustworthy\n* The Bible is clear and accessible to all believers, allowing them to interpret it for themselves\nArguments against:\n* The Bible can be difficult to understand, and different interpretations can lead to division and conflict among believers\n* The Bible is a collection of texts written in different historical contexts, and may not always apply to modern life\n* The Bible does not address all aspects of faith and practice, and therefore tradition and human authority are needed to supplement it.\n2. Sola Fide (\"faith alone\"): This principle holds that faith in Jesus Christ is the only means of salvation and that good works are not necessary for salvation.\nArguments for:\n* Good works are a natural result of true faith, but they do not cause salvation\n* Christ's death and resurrection alone provide salvation, and faith in Him is the only requirement\n* The idea of earning salvation through good works is a denial of Christ's sufficiency\nArguments against:\n* The idea of faith alone can lead to a lack of good works and a lack of concern for living a moral life\n* The Bible teaches that faith and works go together, and one cannot be saved by faith alone\n* It can lead to the idea that belief is more important than action and the belief in salvation by faith alone can lead to complacency in doing good works and helping the poor\n3. Sola Gratia (\"grace alone\"): This principle holds that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, and that it is not earned by human effort or merit.\nArguments for:\n* God's grace is the only means by which we can be saved, and it is not something we can earn or deserve\n* Good works are a response to God's grace, but they do not cause salvation\n* The idea of earning salvation through good works is a denial of God's grace\nArguments against:\n* The idea of grace alone can lead to a lack of good works and a lack of concern for living a moral life\n* The Bible teaches that faith and works go together, and one cannot be saved by grace alone\n* It can lead to the idea that belief is more important than action and can lead to complacency in doing good works and helping the poor\n4. Solus Christus (\"Christ alone\"): This principle holds that Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity, and that no other person or thing can provide salvation.\nArguments for:\n* Christ is the only one who can bridge the gap between God and humanity, and His death and resurrection alone provide salvation\n* Other mediators, such as saints or the Virgin Mary, are not necessary for salvation\n* Christ's unique relationship with God and His role as the only begotten son of God, makes Him the only one who can provide salvation\nArguments against:\n* This can be seen as to denigrating the role of saints and the Virgin Mary, who are also venerated in Christianity\n* This can lead to the belief that salvation is only possible through belief in Christ, and that those who do not believe in Him are damned.\n* It can lead to"

The `BaseEntityEv<Guid>` class is a base class that provides common properties and behavior for all entities, such as an `Id` property and support for raising domain events.\n\nThe `Customer` class uses the Guard Clause pattern, which is a technique for validating method arguments and throwing exceptions if the arguments are invalid. This is done using the `Guard` class, which is a library that provides a set of methods to check the state of arguments and throw exceptions if the arguments are invalid.\n\nThe `Customer` class also uses the Repository pattern, which is a pattern that abstracts the data storage and retrieval away from the business logic. The `Customer` class has a list of `CustomerAddress`, `CustomerEmailAddress`, `CustomerPhoneNumber`, `CustomerPriceList`, `Invoices` which can be considered as the Repository pattern.\n\nThe class also uses the Value Object pattern, which is a pattern that represents a value that has no identity and can be used to provide additional meaning to an entity. The `CustomerCode`, `CustomerDocument`, `FullName`, `CommercialName`, `IsActive`, `SpecificationJson` can be considered as Value object.\n\nThe class also uses the Template Method pattern, which is a pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. The `AddNewCustomerAddress` and `DeleteCustomerAddress` methods can be considered as example of this pattern.\n\nThe class also uses the Lazy Loading pattern, which is a pattern that delays the loading of an object or its properties until they are actually needed. The `BranchOffice` and `CustomerDocumentType` properties are virtual properties, which enables Lazy loading when accessed."

The program also increments the counter \"n\" to keep track of the number of character pairs considered.\n\nThe program then calculates the negative log likelihood by negating the cumulative log likelihood and prints the result.

For each subset, determine the optimal charging time for each receiver based on its current power level and the power delivery rate of the transmitter.\n4.

Activate each transmitter in sequence, and have it charge the receivers in its corresponding subset according to the pre-determined charging times.\n7. Repeat the charging process for each subset until all receivers have been charged.\n\nBy dividing the set of receivers into non-overlapping subsets, we can avoid situations where multiple transmitters try to charge the same receiver at the same time, which would lead to inefficiencies and waste of power. By optimizing the charging times for each receiver, we can ensure that each receiver is charged as quickly as possible while also avoiding overcharging, which could damage the battery or reduce its lifespan. By scheduling the charging times for each subset, we can minimize the overall charging time for all receivers, which would improve the efficiency of the wireless power delivery system."

        "value": "from the following word what is pos tagging and explain rule based tagger and hybrid tagger in bullet points. keep it short It is the process of assigning a part-of -speech to each word in a sentence.\n\n• The input to a tagging algorithm is sequence of words of natural language sentence and specified tag sets(a\nfinite list of part of speech tags).The output is a single best part of speech tag for each word. Many words\nbelong to more than one lexical category.\n\n• For example, the english word 'book' can be a noun as in 'I am reading a good book’ or a verb as in 'The\npolice booked the snatcher’. For example, the hindi word 'sona' may mean 'gold'(noun)or 'sleep'(verb).\n\n• In tagging, to determine the correct lexical category depends on its context. The collection of tags used by a\nparticular tagger is called a tag set. Most parts of speech tag sets make use of some basic categories ,i.e noun,\nverb, adjective, preposition.\n\n• Tag sets differ in how they define categories and how finely they divide words into categories.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n∙ Most tag set capture morpho-syntactic information such as singular/plural, number, gender, tense ,etc.\n∙ Consider the following sentence:\n• Zuhu eats an apple daily\n• Aman ate an apple yesterday\n• They have eaten all the apples in the basket\n• I like to eat guavas.\nThe word eat has many forms.\neat – base form\n\nate – past tense\neats – third person singular subject\neaten – past participle form\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nThe number of tags used by different taggers varies subsequently, some use 20 while others use 400.\n∙ Penn Treebank tag set – 47 tags\n∙ C7 – 164\n∙ TOSCA ICE – 270 tags\n∙ TESS – 200 tags\nLarger tag set\n\ngreater the information captured about linguistic context.\nTask of tagging become more complicated and requires manual correction.\nA bigger tag set can be used for morphologically rich languages without introducing too many tagging errors.\nA tag set that uses just one tag to denote all the verbs will assign identical tags to all the forms of a verb.\nCoarse grained distinction:- appropriate for some tasks.\n• Fine grained tag set:-captures more information\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nTags From Penn Treebank Tag Set\n\nVB – verb, base form\nVBD – verb, past tense\nVBG – verb, gerund or present participle\nVBN - verb, past participle.\nVBP - verb, non third person singular present\nVBZ – verb, third person singular present\nPossible Tags For The Word To Eat\n\n• Eat – VB\n• Ate - VBD\n\n• Eaten – VBN\n• Eats – VBP\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nParts of speech tagging is an early stage of text processing in many NLP application like:\n∙ Speech synthesis\n∙ Machine translation\n∙ Information retrieval\n\n∙ Information extraction.\n\nParts of speech tagging methods has 3 categories.\n\n1. Rule based(linguistic)\n2. Stochastic (data driven)\n3. Hybrid.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n• Rule Based Taggers\nUse hand coded rules to assign tags to words. These rules use a lexicon to obtain a list of candidate tags and then use rules to\ndiscard incorrect tags.\nHave a 2 stage architecture:\nFirst stage is simply a dictionary look up procedure, which returns a set of potential tags and appropriate syntactic features for\neach word.\nSecond stage uses a hand coded rules to discard contextually illegitimate tags to get a single part of speech for each word.Eg:\nThe noun-verb ambiguity.\n\nThe show must go on.\n\nThe potential tags for the word show in this sentence is {VB,NN}.\n\nIf preceding word is determiner THEN eliminate VB tags. This rule simply disallows verb after a determine using this rule the\nword show is noun only.\n• In addition to contextual information, many taggers use morphological information to help in the disambiguation process.\nIf word ends in \\_ing and preceding word is a verb THEN label it a verb(VB).\nThe dog is running in the...\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nRule based tagger require supervised training\nInstead rules can be induced automatically\nTo induce rules, untagged text is run through a tagger\nThe output is then manually corrected\nThe corrected text is then submitted to the tagger, which learns correction rules by comparing the 2 sets of\ndata. This process may be repeated several times.\n\nTAGGIT (Greene and Rubin 1971) :- Initial tagging of Brown Corpus(Francis and Kucera 1982). Rule\nbased s/m, it uses 3,300 disambiguation rules and able to tag 77% of the words in the Brown Corpus with\ntheir correct part of speech.\nAnother rule based tagger is ENGTWOL (voutilainen 1995)\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nAdvantages:\n\n∙ Speed, deterministic than stochastic\n∙ Arguments against them is the skill and effort required in writing disambiguation rules\n∙ Stochastic taggers require manual work if good performance is to be achieved\n∙ Rule based, time is spent in writing a rule set\n∙ Stochastic, time is spent developing restriction on transitions and emissions to improve tagger performance\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n∙ It’s usable for only one language. Using it for another one requires a rewrite of most of the programs.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nStandard stochastic tagger is HMM tagger algorithm\nMarkov model applies the simplifying assumption that the probability of a chain of symbols can be\napproximated in terms of its parts of n-grams\nSimplest n-gram model is unigram model, which assigns the most likely tag to each token\nUnigram model needs to be trained using a tagged training corpus before it can be used to tag data\nThe most likely statistics are gathered over the corpus and used for tagging\nThe context used by the unigram tagger is the text of the word itself\n• Ex: It will assign the tag JJ for each occurrence of fast, since fast is used as an adjective more frequently\nthan used as noun, verb or adverb.\n\nShe had a fast [noun]\nMuslims fast[verb] during Ramadan\nThose who were injured in the accident need to be helped fast[adverb]\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nBigram tagger uses the current word and the tag of previous word in tagging process\nShe had a fast DT JJ (or) DT NN\nAs the tag sequence “DT NN” is more likely than the tag sequence “DD JJ”\nIn general, n gram model considers the current word and the tag of the previous n-1 words in assigning a tag to a\nword\n\n• Tokens Wn-2 Wn-1 W\nn\nWn+1\n\n• Tags tn-2 tn-1 t\nn\ntn+1\n• HMM uses 2 layers of states:\n\n1) Visual layer corresponds to the input words\n2) Hidden layer learnt by the s/m corresponding to the tags\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nGiven a sequence of words, the objective is to find the most probable tag sequence for the sentence\nLet w be the sequence of words.\nW=w1,w2,w3,,,,,,wn\nThe task is to find the tag sequence\nT=t1,t2,t3,,,,,,t\nn\n\nWhich maximizes P(T/W) i.e,,\nApplying Bayes Rule, P(T/W) can be the estimated using the expression:\nP(T/W)= P(W/T) \\*P(T)/P(W)\nThe probability of applying for the word sequence, P(W) remains the same for each tag sequence, we can drop it. So, the\nexpression:\n\nT’= argmaxT\n\nP(W/T) \\* P(T)\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nUsing the Markov assumptions, the probability of a tag sequence can be estimated as the product of the probability of its constituent\nn-grams, i.e,,\n\nP(T)=P(t1\n)\\*P(t2\n/t1\n)\\*P(t3\n/t2\nt1\n).....\\*P(t n\n/t1\n,,,,,tn-1)\n\nP(W/T) is the probability of seeing a word sequence, given a tag sequence.\nEx: It’s asking the probability of seeing “ The egg is rotten” given ‘DT NNP VB JJ’ we make the following two assumptions:\nThe words are independent of each other\nThe probability of a word is dependent only on it’s tag.\nUsing the assumptions, we obtain\nP(W/T)=P(w1\n/t1\n)\\*P(w2\n/t2\n).......P(wi\n/ti\n) \\*......P(wn\n/t\nn\n)\n\ni.e,, P(W/T) = π\nn\ni=1 P(wi\n/ti\n)\n\nso, P(W/T)\\*P(T) = π\nn\ni=1 P(wi\n/ti\n) \\* P(t1\n)\\*P(t2\n/t1\n)\\*P(t3\n/t2\nt1\n).....\\*P(t n\n/t1\n,,,,,tn-1)\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nApproximating the tag history using only the two previous tags, the transition probability, P(T) becomes\nP(T)= P(t1)\\*P(t2/t1)\\*P(t3/t2t1)\\*.....\\*P(tn /tn-2 tn-1)\nHence, P(t/w) can be estimated as\n\nP(w/t)\\*P(T) = πi=1 P(wi/ti ) \\* P(t1)\\*P(t2/t1)\\*P(t3/t2t1)\\*.....\\* P(tn /tn-2 tn-1)\n= πi=1 P(wi/ti ) \\* P(t1)\\*P(t2/t1)\\* πi=3 P(ti /ti-2 ti-1)\nWe estimate these probabilities from relative frequencies via maximum likelihood estimation.\nP(ti /ti-2 ti-1) = C(ti-2 , ti-1 , ti)\n\nC(ti-2 , ti-1)\nP(wi/t i ) = C(wi , ti )\nC(t i)\nWhere C(ti-2, ti-1 , ti) is the number of occurrences of t i , followed by ti-2 , ti-1.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nAdvantage:\n•Accurate and language independent\nDrawback:\n• Require manually tagged corpus for training.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging- Hybrid Tagger\n\n• Hybrid approaches to tagging combine the features of both the rule based and stochastic approaches .\n• They use rules to assign tags to words .\n• Like the stochastic taggers ,this is a machine learning techniques and rules are automatically induced from the\ndata.\n\n• Transformation-based learning (TBL) of tags ,also known as Brill tagging ,is a example of hybrid approach .\n• The input to Brill's TBL tagging algorithm is a tagged corpus and a lexicon .\n• The initial state annotator uses the lexicon to assign the most likely tag to each word as the start state.\n• An ordered set of transformational rules are are applied sequentially. The rule that result in the most improved\ntagging is selected.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n• A manually tagged corpus is used as reference for truth.\n\n• The process is iterated until some stopping criteria is reached ,such as when no significant\ninformation is achieved over the previous iteration.\n\n• At each iteration ,the transformation that results in the highest score is selected.\n\n• The output of the algorithm is a ranked list of learned transformation that transform the initial\ntagging close to correct tagging .\n\n• New text can then be annotated by first assigning the most frequent tag and then applying the\nranked list of learned transformation in order.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\n• Input: Tagged corpus and lexicon(with most frequent information)\n\n• step1: Label every word with most likely tag(from dictionary)\n\n• step2: Check every possible transformation and select one which most improves tagging\n\n• step3: Re-tag corpus applying the rules\n\n• Repeat 2-3 Until some stopping criterion is reached\n\n• RESULT: Ranked sequence of tranformation rules\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nAssume that in a corpus,fish is the most likely to be a noun.\n\nP(NN/fish) = 0.91\nP(VB/fish) = 0.09\n\nnow,consider the following two sentences and their initial tags :\n\nI/PRP like/VB to/TO eat/VB fish/NNP\nI/PRP like/VB to/TO fish/NNP\n\nThe most likely tag for fish in NNP, the tagger assigns this tag to the word in both sentence .In the\nsecond case, it is a mistake .\n\nAfter initial tagging when the transformation rules are applied ,the tagger learns a rule that applies\nexactly to this mis-tagging of fish.

Here's a hypothetical alternate episode of Outlander where Jamie is able to travel forward in time with Claire before the Battle of Culloden:\n\nClaire was anxious as she stood at the stones of Craigh na Dun, waiting for Jamie. She knew that the battle of Culloden was fast approaching, and she had to convince Jamie to come with her. She heard a rustling behind her and turned to see Jamie emerge from the darkness.\n\n\"Are ye ready?\" he asked, his face set in determination.\n\n\"Yes,\" Claire said, taking his hand. \"We have to go now, Jamie. We can't stay here.\"\n\nJamie nodded and stepped forward with Claire. As they passed through the stones, Claire felt a familiar lurch in her stomach, and suddenly they were in a different time and place.\n\nThey emerged onto a busy street in Edinburgh, and Claire took a deep breath of the cool, crisp air. She turned to Jamie and saw him staring in wonder at the modern city.\n\n\"Welcome to the future,\" she said, smiling.\n\nJamie shook his head, trying to take it all in. \"It's a grand sight, but I canna understand it,\" he said, bewildered.\n\nClaire took Jamie's hand and led him to a nearby park. They sat down on a bench, and Claire explained everything to him: the cars, the airplanes, the telephones, and the electricity. Jamie listened intently, his eyes wide with amazement.\n\nAfter a few hours of exploring the city, Claire and Jamie returned to their hotel room. As they lay in bed, Jamie wrapped his arms around her and whispered, \"I never thought I would leave Scotland, but I'm glad I did. As long as I'm with ye, Sassenach, I'm happy.\"\n\nClaire smiled and leaned into his embrace, feeling a sense of contentment she had never known before. As the night wore on, they talked about their future and what it would hold.\n\nOver the next few months, Jamie and Claire settled into their new life in the future. Jamie found work as a blacksmith and learned to navigate the modern world, while Claire worked as a nurse in a nearby hospital. They made new friends and started building a life together, free from the constraints of their past.\n\nBut as the months passed, they both knew that they couldn't stay in the future forever. They missed their friends and family, and Jamie longed to see Scotland again. They knew they had to find a way back to their own time.\n\nWith the help of a local historian, they discovered a way to travel back through the stones of Craigh na Dun. Jamie and Claire stood together, holding hands, as they passed through the stones once again.\n\nAs they emerged on the other side, they saw the familiar landscape of Scotland stretching out before them. They knew they had returned just in time for the Battle of Culloden.\n\nBut this time, they were together, and they knew they could face whatever lay ahead. They drew strength from each other as they prepared for battle, and as they charged into the fray, they knew that they would emerge victorious.\n\nAfter the battle, as they stood among the fallen, Claire turned to Jamie and said, \"We did it, Jamie. We changed history.\"\n\nJamie smiled, his face radiant with joy. \"Aye, we did. And we did it together.\""

The `pos_hint` attribute is used to hint at a widget's position within its parent, but it does not actually set the position of the widget. Instead, it is used to adjust the position of the widget relative to the other widgets in the parent layout.\n\nAnother issue is that you have set the size\\_hint\\_y of the MDList widget in the MDNavigationDrawer to 0.9 which makes the MDList only take 90% of the space vertically, the other 10% is taken by the MDTopAppBar, which will make the MDList not visible.\n\nYou should try to remove the `pos_hint` and `size_hint_y` attributes from the QuestsScreen layout, and adjust the layout using `padding`, `spacing`, and `minimum_height` properties of the widgets to achieve the desired positioning and size.\n\nYou should also consider to set the size\\_hint\\_y of the MDList to 1, since it is the only widget in the MDNavigationDrawer, and it should take the full vertical space."

However, it seems that the `MDNavigationLayout` is covering the `MDTopAppBar` and going over it, causing the top app bar to be hidden.\n\nOne way to fix this would be to use a different layout widget, such as a `BoxLayout`, to stack the `MDTopAppBar` and `MDNavigationLayout` widgets on top of each other. You can then set the `size_hint_y` of the `MDTopAppBar` to a small value (e.g. `0.1`) to ensure that it takes up less vertical space than the `MDNavigationLayout`.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use a `RelativeLayout` and set the `MDTopAppBar` to be on top of the `MDNavigationLayout` by setting the `pos_hint` of the `MDNavigationLayout` to be `{\"top\":1}` and the `pos_hint` of the `MDTopAppBar` to be `{\"top\":1.1}` or so on. This will ensure that `MDTopAppBar` is always on top of `MDNavigationLayout`.\n\nYou can also make use of the `z-index` by giving the `MDTopAppBar` a higher number than `MDNavigationLayout` this way `MDTopAppBar` will always be on top of `MDNavigationLayout`."

To fix this, you can set a `size_hint_y` for the `MDNavigationLayout` so that it only takes up a certain proportion of the height of its parent, rather than all of it. For example, you can set `size_hint_y: 0.9` to make the `MDNavigationLayout` take up 90% of the height of the `MDBoxLayout`. You can experiment with different values to find the one that works best for your layout."

It is important that the MDTabs are a child of the QuestsScreen widget, and that they are added to the layout of the QuestsScreen correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue could be that the QuestsScreen class is not correctly inheriting from the Screen class. Make sure that your QuestsScreen class is correctly defined as a subclass of the Screen class.\n\nAnother possibility is that the widgets inside the MDTabs are not being added correctly.\nIt's also possible that there is a problem with the way the on\\_tab\\_switch callback is being called.

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Certainly, one way to fix the problem of double initialization in your Kivy app is to use the `ScreenManager`'s `transition` property. By default, the `transition` property is set to `NoTransition`, which means that when you switch between screens, the old screen is simply removed and the new screen is added. This can cause the new screen to be initialized multiple times if you switch back and forth between it and another screen.\n\nInstead, you can set the `transition` property to `FadeTransition`, which will cause the new screen to fade in over the old screen, rather than replacing it. This way, when you switch back to a screen that was already initialized, it will not be initialized again.\n\nHere is an example of how you could set the `transition` property to `FadeTransition`:\n```\nscreen_manager = ScreenManager(transition=FadeTransition())\n```\nYou can also change the duration of the transition and other options on the FadeTransition class.\n```\nscreen_manager = ScreenManager(transition=FadeTransition(duration=.5))\n```\nAnother solution could be set the screens on the ScreenManager when the app starts, instead of doing it on the kv file.\n```\nscreen_manager = ScreenManager()\nscreen_manager.add_widget(QuestsScreen(name=\"quests_screen\"))\nscreen_manager.add_widget(QuestManagementScreen(name=\"quest_management_screen\"))\nscreen_manager.add_widget(RewardsScreen(name=\"rewards_screen\"))\n```\nThis way, the screens are only created once at the start of the app, and the ScreenManager simply switches between them, instead of recreating them every time a new screen"

The author notes that as a consequence of this trend, many startups that are part of Y Combinator (YC), a well-known startup accelerator, are facing more technology risk than market risk.\n\nIn the context of startups, technology risk refers to the risk that a startup's product or service may not work as intended or may not be possible to build with current technology. On the other hand, market risk refers to the risk that there may not be a large enough market for the startup's product or service.\n\nThe author is suggesting that with the wave of startups building on LLMs, the main question for many YC startups is not whether people want their product or service, but rather whether it is technically possible to build it. This is because building on LLMs requires a high degree of technical expertise, and there is a greater risk that the technology may not work as intended or may not be scalable to meet the demands of a larger market.\n\nOverall, the tweet is highlighting the unique challenges and risks that startups face when building on cutting-edge AI technology like LLMs, which can be both exciting and daunting at the same time."

        "value": "Here is how Im interpreting these topics. Please give me feedback as a computational social linguistic: \n\nTopic 1 is the most probable in 2164 out of 4800 tweets in the dataset, this represents 45% of our dataset. We see words like “time”, “deadline”, “doubt”, “eventual”, “capital”, procrastination”, “deep-seated”, “linguistic”, “publication” etc. that make it up. When we closely read the tweets that make up this topic, we see an interesting register. The most prevalent tweet in this dataset is a sarcastic one by a parody page called @ShitAcademicsSay which was retweeted several times: “It’s not academic writing procrastination. It’s a preemptive withholding of linguistic capital until such time as anxiety elicited by nonnegotiable deadlines exceeds deep-seated doubt as to the necessity of the eventual publication”. In a humorous tone, this tweet lays bare several things that are wrong with academia. The other important type of tweet in this topic are details of different workshops that people run to reduce AWA. Together then, topic 1 potentially refers to two ways in which academics try to deal with AWA: self-depreciating humour and conducting workshops. \n\nWith 1695 tweets, Topic 2 accounts for over 35% of the dataset and consists of words like “confronting”, “tips”, “year”, “work”, “success”, “well-being”, “self-care” etc. Representative tweets include a highly re-tweeted, serious critique of academic norms that result in negative affects like AWA: “self-care and well-being efforts in academia are often mischaracterized as procrastination due to the ill-defined nature of academic work and success resulting in persistent negative affect (anxiety, guilt) and work-life imbalance\\n\\ntl;dr: I should be writing”. Unlike in topic 1, here we see a serious register being used to analyse AWA as well as its external factors. The other common tweet in this topic are articles, tips, blogs on handing AWA. So while topic 1 had workshops, here we see more written reflections and suggestions shared by academics. \n\nWith 841 tweets or 17.5%., topic 3 is least represented. Here we see keywords like “process”, “#writing”, “#phdchat”, “students”, “provide”, “focus”, “confronting”, “managing” , “states”, “colleagues”, “joined”, “testing” etc. The most common tweet here involves a faculty describing efforts by their colleagues writing to their senator urging them to cancel standardized testing and focus more on less anxiety-inducing forms of assessment like formative assessment. Another tweet reflects on the precarity involved in their profession, how that creates writing anxiety, how they feel anxious even writing about their experiences of writing anxiety. Another talks about how the extremely rigid nature of academic writing and the need to sell yourself in your writing gives them anxiety. Together then, this topic looks at analysis of AWA that look at textual features as well as external national level policies. In terms of solutions, unlike sharing tips and conducting workshops like in earlier topics, here we see more expansive attempts to address structural, social issues which cause AWA."

In a classical computer, information is stored and processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. In a quantum computer, information is stored and processed using quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent a 0, a 1, or both at the same time.\n\nOne of the unique properties of qubits is that they can be in a state of superposition, meaning that they can represent multiple values simultaneously. This property allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nAnother important property of qubits is entanglement, which means that the state of one qubit can be directly influenced by the state of another qubit, even if they are separated by a large distance. This property allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations that are not possible on classical computers.\n\nQuantum computers are still in the early stages of development and are not yet widely available. However, they have the potential to revolutionize fields such as chemistry, materials science, and machine learning by enabling the solution of problems that are currently too difficult or time-consuming for classical computers to solve."

        "value": "I want you to act like a complete expert in the field of web components and accessibility. I'm going to post you a series of highlights from the Full Stack Web Components book about custom elements and form controls. You should explain and summarize this using code examples by creating a custom element named TextInputComponent. This component should accept custom validators. Please write your comments in the code paying specific attention to the highlights I pasted below:\n - “By default, the HTMLInputElement should report validity and it’s value to a parent HTMLFormElement, however, the Shadow DOM boundary blocks communication between the form and input” \n - “When form inputs are not properly configured, accessibility issues can also arise because screen readers expect form controls to have specific relationships with elements that label them. Shadow DOM can break the connection between a label and form control. \n - Form-associated custom elements solve these problems by introducing the ElementInternals interface on the custom element. The ElementInternals interface allows the custom element to participate in a form like any typical form control.” \n - “When the formAssociated property is set to true on the custom element class, ElementInternals is provided to an autonomous custom element by calling attachInternals(). It’s typical to set another property on the class to an instance of ElementInternals so you can reference it later” \n - “What sets form-associated custom elements apart from autonomous custom elements is the addition of the ElementInternals interface and a new property named formAssociated. When formAssociated is true, the custom element provides a slew of other lifecycle hooks” \n - “If TextInputComponent extended from the HTMLInputElement class, it would be a customized built-in element and lose the ability to incorporate Shadow DOM or become a form-associated custom element.” \n - “appears the structure of the template is just enough to support the input and validation messages, but lacks support for the label. This is intentional because the label must be a sibling of TextInputComponent, not a child, so screen readers can effectively analyze the form for accessibility purposes” \n - “ElementInternals gives a form control the ability to communicate value and validity with the form.” \n - “The third property called condition is equal to a function that takes an element as an argument and returns a boolean. We should assume the element passed into the first argument is the form control we’re validating against.” \n - “treat the HTMLInputElement as the single source of truth for component state and essentially use TextInputComponent as a pass-thru, exposing properties of the HTMLInputElement with getters on the component class and using setters that change the state of the HTMLInputElement. That way, TextInputComponent exposes an outward-facing API” \n - “value and disabled can reliably be set through properties on HTMLInputElement, but there is no equivalent setter for required; required state must be set through an attribute” \n - “It’s likely the HTMLInputElement hasn’t received a call to setAttribute because it doesn’t exist yet. Remember, the HTMLInputElement is encapsulated by Shadow DOM. When TextInputComponent instantiates, attributeChangedCallback fires almost immediately, but the browser hasn’t yet fully parsed all the nodes in the ShadowDOM. \n - To handle situations like this, custom elements include another lifecycle method named connectedCallback that runs when the custom element is added to DOM. connectedCallback offers a space where you can reliably query DOM nodes in the custom element ShadowRoot.” \n - “Combined with attributeChangedCallback, you developed a means to pass the values of attributes from parent to child whenever the custom element is instantiated, while getters and setters declared on the TextInputComponent class handle changing the value whenever it changes during the lifespan of the component” \n - “list is only a getter on HTMLInputElement. The only way to set list is via setAttribute, which is handled in attributeChangedCallback.” \n - \n -"

The `connectMqtt()` function is defined twice, which could lead to confusion and errors.\n3. The `subscribeAll()` function is called in `connectMqtt()` but it is not passed any arguments, which means it will not work as expected.\n4. The `mqttClient` object is defined in the global scope but it is not initialized until the `setupMqtt()` function is called. This means that any code that tries to use the `mqttClient` object before `setupMqtt()` is called will not work as expected.\n5. The `mqttClient` object is initialized with a `WiFiClient` object that is not defined or passed as an argument. This means that the `mqttClient` object will not be able to connect to the MQTT broker.\n6. The `callback()` function is declared but it is not used anywhere in the code.\n\nTo fix these issues, the code could be updated as follows:\n\n1. Implement the `subscribeAll()` function and make sure it is called with the correct arguments.\n2. Remove the second definition of the `connectMqtt()` function and make sure the `setupMqtt()` function calls the correct version of the function.\n3.

Pelosi, known for her fierce competitiveness, cracked her first egg with confidence, quickly downing it in one swift gulp. Schiff, never one to back down from a challenge, followed suit, swallowing his egg just as quickly.\n\nAs the competition continued, it became clear that Pelosi was in top form. She powered through egg after egg with ease, never once breaking her stride. Schiff, on the other hand, struggled to keep up, pausing frequently to wipe sweat from his brow.\n\nDespite his best efforts, Schiff ultimately fell behind, eventually conceding defeat to Pelosi. As the crowd erupted in cheers, Pelosi triumphantly raised her arms in the air, a grin spreading across her face.\n\nIn an interview after the competition, Schiff praised Pelosi's impressive performance, saying \"I knew I was in for a tough challenge going up against Nancy. She's a pro at this stuff and it shows. I'm just glad I could be a part of such a great event for a good cause.\"\n\nOverall, the egg eating competition was a resounding success, raising thousands of dollars for local food banks and providing a lighthearted moment of entertainment for those in attendance. As for Pelosi, she proved once again that she's a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the political battlefield."

The `.ac` and `.TRAN` commands specify that the simulation should perform an AC frequency sweep from 1 Hz to 1 GHz and a transient simulation from time 0 to 10 microseconds with a time step of 1 microsecond, respectively. The `.end` command signals the end of the netlist file.\n\nTo simulate this circuit using Spectre, you can run the following command in a Unix-like terminal:\n```python\nspectre netlist_file.scs -format psfascii -outdir output_dir\n```\nHere, `netlist_file.scs` is the name of the netlist file, `psfascii` specifies the output format for the simulation results, and `output_dir` is the name of the directory where the simulation results will be saved.\n\nAfter the simulation is complete, you can use a waveform viewer such as AWaves or SpectreRF to visualize the simulation results."

        "value": "Sure! Here's one way you could design a like button in React:\n\nFirst, let's create a `LikeButton` component that takes in a `likes` prop and renders a button with the number of likes. We'll also include an `onClick` prop that will be called when the button is clicked:\n```\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction LikeButton({ likes, onClick }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      {likes} Likes\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\nNext, let's use the `LikeButton` component in our app. We'll keep track of the number of likes in the component's state and update it when the button is clicked:\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleLikeClick() {\n    setLikes(likes + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <LikeButton likes={likes} onClick={handleLikeClick} />\n  );\n}\n```\nThat's it! Now you have a functional like button that increments the number of likes each time it's clicked.\n\nYou can customize the appearance and behavior of the button further by adding additional props or by using CSS styles. For example, you could add a prop to toggle the text between \"Like\" and \"Unlike\" depending on the state of the button, or you could add a loading state to display a spinner while the like count is being updated."

        "value": "To create a basic webpage using Python to collect details, store in a MySQL database, and display the same, you can use the Django web framework and Nginx as the web server. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Install necessary software:\n\nFirst, you will need to install Python, Django, and MySQL on your server. You can install them using the following commands:\n```sql\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev\nsudo pip3 install Django\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n```\nYou will also need to install the MySQL driver for Python, which you can do with the following command:\n```arduino\nsudo apt-get install python3-mysqldb\n```\n1. Create a Django project:\n\nNext, you need to create a new Django project using the `django-admin` command:\n```\ndjango-admin startproject myproject\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `myproject` with some basic files and folders.\n\n1. Create a Django app:\n\nNext, you need to create a new Django app within your project. You can do this with the following command:\n```bash\ncd myproject\npython3 manage.py startapp myapp\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `myapp` with some basic files and folders.\n\n1. Create a database:\n\nNext, you need to create a MySQL database for your Django project. You can do this by logging into the MySQL server with the following command:\n```css\nmysql -u root -p\n```\nThis will prompt you for your MySQL root password. Once you have entered it, you can create a new database with the following command:\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE mydatabase;\n```\n1. Configure Django settings:\n\nNext, you need to configure the Django settings to use your MySQL database. Open the `settings.py` file within your `myproject` directory and add the following code:\n```arduino\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'mydatabase',\n        'USER': 'root',\n        'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_root_password',\n        'HOST': 'localhost',\n        'PORT': '3306',\n    }\n}\n```\nReplace `your_mysql_root_password` with your actual MySQL root password.\n\n1. Create Django models:\n\nNext, you need to create Django models to represent the data you want to collect and store in your MySQL database. Open the `models.py` file within your `myapp` directory and define your models as Python classes. For example:\n```scss\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    age = models.IntegerField()\n    email = models.EmailField()\n```\nThis defines a `Person` model with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `email`.\n\n1. Create Django views:\n\nNext, you need to create Django views to handle user requests and interact with your models. Open the `views.py` file within your `myapp` directory and define your views as Python functions. For example:\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom .models import Person\n\ndef index(request):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        name = request.POST['name']\n        age = request.POST['age']\n        email = request.POST['email']\n        person = Person(name=name, age=age, email=email)\n        person.save()\n    people = Person.objects.all()\n    return render(request, 'index.html', {'people': people})\n```\nThis defines an `index` view that handles both GET and POST requests. If the request is a POST request, it creates a new `Person` object based on the data submitted in the form and saves it to"

Here's an example of how to implement pairs trading in Python using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and z-score, along with code for executing and calculating the strategy's mark-to-market (MtM) and profit and loss (PnL).\n\nDefinition\n----------\n\nPairs trading involves identifying two highly correlated assets and taking advantage of temporary deviations in their price ratio. The strategy involves going long on the underperforming asset and shorting the outperforming asset when their price ratio diverges significantly from their historical mean. When the price ratio returns to its mean, the positions are closed, resulting in a profit.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nIn this example, we will use the stock prices of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to implement a pairs trading strategy. We will start by collecting the historical stock prices for both stocks and computing the price ratio between them. We will then use the ADF test to determine whether the price ratio is stationary, which is a prerequisite for pairs trading. If the price ratio is stationary, we will compute the z-score of the price ratio to identify when it diverges significantly from its historical mean. Finally, we will use the z-score to generate trading signals and execute the trades, and we will calculate the MtM and PnL of the strategy.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\n\n# Collect historical stock prices\nstart_date = '2010-01-01'\nend_date = '2021-09-30'\nsymbol_list = ['KO', 'PEP']\ndata = pd.DataFrame()\nfor symbol in symbol_list:\n    df = pd.read_csv(f'https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/{symbol}?period1=1262304000&period2=1632988800&interval=1d&events=history&includeAdjustedClose=true', \n                     index_col='Date', parse_dates=['Date'])\n    df = df.loc[start_date:end_date, ['Adj Close']]\n    df.rename(columns={'Adj Close': symbol}, inplace=True)\n    data = pd.concat([data, df], axis=1)\n\n# Compute price ratio\nprice_ratio = data['KO'] / data['PEP']\n\n# Test for stationarity\nadf_result = adfuller(price_ratio)\nprint(f\"ADF statistic: {adf_result[0]}\")\nprint(f\"p-value: {adf_result[1]}\")\nif adf_result[1] > 0.05:\n    print(\"Price ratio is not stationary, pairs trading cannot be performed.\")\nelse:\n    # Compute z-score\n    mu = np.mean(price_ratio)\n    sigma = np.std(price_ratio)\n    z_score = (price_ratio - mu) / sigma\n\n    # Generate trading signals\n    long_signal = z_score < -1\n    short_signal = z_score > 1\n\n    # Execute trades\n    positions = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)\n    positions['KO'] = np.where(long_signal, 1, np.where(short_signal, -1, 0))\n    positions['PEP'] = np.where(long_signal, -1, np.where(short_signal, 1, 0))\n    trades = positions.diff().fillna(0)\n\n    # Calculate MtM and PnL\n    prices = data.loc[trades.index]\n    mtm = (trades.shift() * prices).sum(axis=1).cumsum()\n    pnl = trades.shift() * -prices\n    pnl = pnl.sum(axis=1).cumsum()\n    print(f\"MtM: {mtm.iloc[-1]}\")\n```"

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Load shedding is a technique used to reduce the load on a system by shedding, or temporarily rejecting, certain requests. This can be useful in a Kubernetes cluster, where you may want to avoid overloading the system with too many requests.\n\nTo implement load shedding for a REST API service in Kubernetes, you can use a tool like the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). This will allow you to set maximum limits on the number of pods that can be running for your service, and it will automatically scale the number of pods up or down based on the incoming request load.\n\nHere's an example of how you might set up the HPA for a service:\n\n1. First, create a `Deployment` for your service that defines the number of replicas you want to run. This will be the minimum number of replicas that will be available to serve requests.\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: my-service\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: my-service\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: my-service\n        image: my-service:latest\n```\n2. Next, create a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` that will control the scaling of your service. This will allow you to set the maximum number of replicas that can be running for your service, as well as the target CPU utilization for the pods.\n```\napiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  maxReplicas: 10\n  minReplicas: 2\n  scaleTargetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: my-service\n  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50\n```\n3. With these configurations in place, Kubernetes will automatically scale the number of replicas for your service based on the incoming request load and the specified target CPU utilization. When the load on the system increases and the target CPU utilization is reached, the HPA will automatically add more replicas to handle the additional requests. Conversely, when the load on the system decreases, the HPA will automatically remove replicas to reduce the number of unused resources in the cluster.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

However, in quantum computing, qubits can be in multiple states at the same time, which is known as superposition. This means that a single qubit can represent many different values simultaneously.\n\nAdditionally, qubits can also be entangled, which means that the state of one qubit can affect the state of another, even if they are separated by a great distance. This property of entanglement allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nOverall, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize many fields, including cryptography, chemistry, and artificial intelligence, by allowing for much faster and more efficient computation of complex problems."

Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\nStep 1: Define the API signature in C# with the provided parameters as follows:\n```csharp\npublic string CallExternalApi(string url, string api, string filter = \"\")\n{\n    // Your code to call the external API here\n}\n```\nStep 2: Define the request parameters in C# as follows:\n```csharp\npublic class RequestParameters\n{\n    public string Api { get; set; }\n    public string Filter { get; set; }\n}\n```\nStep 3: Send a request from Postman to the API endpoint by calling the `CallExternalApi` method with the URL and API parameters as follows:\n```csharp\nvar requestParameters = new RequestParameters\n{\n    Api = \"/categories\",\n    Filter = \"\"\n};\n\nvar responseJson = CallExternalApi(\"https://example.com\", requestParameters.Api, requestParameters.Filter);\n```\nStep 4: Parse and save the JSON body using the System.text.Json/NewtonSoft library as follows:\n```csharp\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\nvar jsonObject = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<JsonElement>(responseJson);\n```\nNote that `JsonElement` is a type provided by the System.text.Json library.\n\nStep 5: Filter the response based on the input category using LINQ as follows:\n```csharp\nvar filteredJsonObject = jsonObject.GetProperty(\"categories\").EnumerateArray().Where(c => c.GetProperty(\"name\").GetString() == filter).FirstOrDefault();\n```\nNote that `filter` is the input category specified in the request parameters.\n\nStep 6: Serialize the request body (JSON element) as per the requirement using the System.text.Json/NewtonSoft library as follows:\n```csharp\nvar requestBody = JsonSerializer.Serialize(jsonObject);\n```\nStep 7: Send a response on Postman in JSON format using the `JsonResult` class in ASP.NET Core as follows:\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\npublic IActionResult GetJson()\n{\n    var jsonResult = new JsonResult(filteredJsonObject);\n\n    return jsonResult;\n}\n```\nIf you have the requirement to replace all values of \"HTTP\" from \"True\" to \"False\" for a given category, you can use the `JsonElement` type and LINQ to query the JSON object, and then modify the value using the `JsonDocument` class provided by the System.text.Json library. For example:\n```csharp\n// Replace all values of \"HTTP\" from \"True\" to \"False\" for a given category\nvar category = filteredJsonObject.GetProperty(\"name\").GetString();\n\nif (category == \"example category\")\n{\n    foreach (var entry in filteredJsonObject.GetProperty(\"entries\").EnumerateArray())\n    {\n        if (entry.TryGetProperty(\"HTTP\", out JsonElement httpProperty))\n        {\n            if (httpProperty.GetString() == \"True\")\n            {\n                var jsonDoc = JsonDocument.Parse(requestBody);\n                var element = jsonDoc.RootElement.GetProperty(\"categories\").EnumerateArray().Where(c => c.GetProperty(\"name\").GetString() == category).FirstOrDefault();\n                element.GetProperty(\"entries\").EnumerateArray().Where(e => e.GetProperty(\"id\").GetString() == entry.GetProperty(\"id\").GetString()).FirstOrDefault().GetProperty(\"HTTP\").SetValue(\"False\");\n                requestBody = jsonDoc.RootElement.ToString();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that this is just an example, and you should modify it to fit your specific requirements."

An example of code that would be better suited as an integration test would be a system that involves multiple classes or components working together, such as a database connected to a web application.

CFML is a tag-based language that is similar to HTML and XML, but it also includes programming constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and functions.\n\nWith ColdFusion, developers can quickly build dynamic web applications that connect to databases, perform complex business logic, and generate dynamic content. It also includes a built-in web server, making it easy to deploy and manage applications. ColdFusion is still used by many organizations today, although its popularity has waned somewhat in recent years with the rise of other web development platforms."

The player will be able to expand the grid infinitely in any direction by unlocking extra grid cells through user purchases or rewards. The game will have the following features:\n\nCity Tiles:\nPlayers will be able to select empty grid cells and add city tiles to them. The city tiles can be selected, changed, and upgraded based on the player's requirements. The city tiles' visual and stats will change based on their current level and active tile enhancements. Players can level up the city tiles by spending money metrics.\n\nScore Metrics:\nThe game will have score metrics that will be updated at set intervals based on the city tiles' current stats. The player score will be updated based on these score metrics. The game will track the score metrics and trigger game over if any of them reach zero.\n\nViewport:\nThe player can zoom in/out and drag the viewport based on the zoom level.\n\nCity Timeline:\nThe game will have a set timeline, and the player can configure how often a 'score metrics update,' 'decide stage,' and 'develop stage' will trigger. The default values are one day/week/month, one year, and five years, respectively. The player can also configure the duration of the timeline in minutes and the number of years in the timeline. The player can progress time on a scaled level based on the desired duration. The game will calculate and trigger 'develop stage' and 'decide stage' events at the correct intervals. The game will detect and trigger the end of the timeline.\n\nDecision Cards:\nAt regular intervals, the player will be served up a selection of random decision cards. These cards will allow the player to activate or deactivate tile enhancements based on their choice. They can also adjust current score metrics based on their choice. The game will weight selection by card rarity and active tiles in the city.\n\nDevelop Stage:\nAt the 'develop stage,' the timeline will pause, and the player can interact with the cells. The game will ensure that all grid cells are filled before allowing progression.\n\nPurchase:\nThe player will have to spend a certain amount of money metrics to perform specific actions or purchase items. The game will test whether the player can afford the action/item based on their money metric. The game will update the user's money score metric on the purchase of the action/item.\n\nWeather/Climate:\nThe game will trigger weather events at certain intervals that will affect the city's growth and development. The score metrics will be adjusted based on the active weather effects.\n\nDevelopment/QA Shortcuts:\nThe game will have various shortcuts that will allow developers and QA to test the game more efficiently. They can manually adjust any score metric, have infinite money, unlock all tiles, activate/deactivate any tile enhancements, control the speed of the timeline at runtime, enable 'lazy auto decision' or an 'autoplay' for testing.\n\nConclusion:\nCity Simulator is a complex and engaging game that allows players to build and manage their own city. With a customizable grid system and a set timeline, players will have to make critical decisions that will impact the city's growth and development. The game's weather events will add an extra layer of complexity, making it an exciting and challenging experience for players."

We then set the barcode type to UPC-A by setting the `TYPE` parameter to `UPCA`, and we specify the barcode data as a string of 12 digits.\n\nWe also set the `IncludeLabel` property to `true` so that a label with the barcode data is included in the generated image. We specify the barcode color as black and the background color as white. We set the barcode image size to 300 pixels wide by 150 pixels high.\n\nFinally, we save the generated barcode image to a file named `upc-a.png` using the `SaveImage` method, specifying the image format as `SaveTypes.PNG`.\n\nNote: Before using this code, make sure to add the BarcodeLib library to your project by installing it via NuGet package manager."

This assumes that the `useUpdateActiveStatus` hook sets a `message` property in its return object. You may need to adjust this to match your actual implementation.\n\nThese changes should allow you to test that the correct message is returned from the API call."

Modify your script to use `mapfile` or `readarray` (these commands are equivalent) to read the file content into an array:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmapfile -t arr < svn01Repos.txt\n\nprintf \"%s\\n\" \"${arr[@]}\"\n\nfor i in \"${arr[@]}\"; do\n    svn co svn://subversion02.ipacc.com/\"$i\"\ndone\n```\nThis approach should work with Bash 4.0 and later. It simplifies your script and may help avoid issues related to reading the file.\n\nIf the issue still persists, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Check the encoding of the `svn01Repos.txt` file. Ensure it's UTF-8 and doesn't contain any special characters that might be causing issues.\n2. Print the Bash version being used in Jenkins by adding `echo $BASH_VERSION` to your script. This will help you identify any differences in the version that might cause the problem.\n3. Make sure your Jenkins environment doesn't have any specific configurations or restrictions that may affect the script execution.\n4. Check the Jenkins logs for any error messages or warnings that might give a clue about the issue.\n5. If possible, run the script on a RHEL 7.9 system outside of Jenkins to see if the issue is specific to Jenkins or the OS itself."

With colleagues, with partners, with customers… Is that information in safe hands? Or are files available to people who shouldn’t have access? Florbs mitigates the risk of data exposure by giving Google Workspace admins in-depth insights into file sharing habits. How? Let’s deepdive into 2 ways Florbs can help you:\n1) Identifying file sharing habits\n\n2) How to track where files end up\n\nHow to identify file sharing habits within your domain\nWhen collaborating within Google Workspace, there are multiple ways of sharing to other people’s Google Drive available. Depending on your domain settings, you can share files with:\n\nSpecific users\nSpecific groups\nThe whole domain (with a link)\nAnyone with the link (publicly accessible)\nAll four methods are reflected in your Florbs dashboard:\n\nThe blocks show you an overview of the amount of files that are shared by a specific method\nSo, what are we looking at?\n\nTotal shared:\n\nThe amount of files that a user has shared. E.g: the total amount of all sharing methods combined. This block will provide you with an indication whether there is a lot of (external) collaboration happening.\nShared with anyone:\nThe amount of files that are shared publicly. Everyone with the URL to a file is able to access these files.\nDomain shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with the whole domain. Everyone within the same domain as the person who shared it is able to access these files.\nGroup shares:\nThe amount of files shared with a group. When you hover over this block, you are able to differentiate between internal and external groups.\nUser shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with specific users. The most precise and transparent way of file-sharing. Hovering over the block differentiates between internal and external users as well.\n\nBy using your Florbs dashboard, you can see which sharing methods are used the most. And, whether file sharing is done safely. When combining this with the extensive search functionality, you can also track what kind of files are shared which way.\nThis overview shows you if you need to educate your whole organization about sharing habits, or only a few users.\nShare safely, share specifically\nAlthough all different sharing methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is a safe option to stick to the principle of least privilege; If people don’t need full access, don’t grant them full access. File sharing management is as important as other safety measures within your domain.\n\nIt is possible to restrict sharing publicly across your domain entirely. However, there are a lot of situations in which files are meant to be shared publicly. If you restrict file sharing, those files will be duplicated/downloaded or sent as attachments . And they will float around in all kinds of different versions. This means that although you won’t see the sharing within your Google Workspace anymore, it is still happening. Luckily, Florbs enables to monitor your Google Drive without forbidding all kinds of options.\n\nDeeper into sharing habits\nLet’s look at the sharing habits of Scott as shown on the screenshot. He shares a lot of files with groups and users, but a lot of them publicly as well. With the amount of files that Scott shared externally, it could be a good idea to check what is happening. Although sharing files using the ‘anyone with the link’ ’option could have been done intentional, it could be done due to being in a hurry or out of ignorance about better sharing methods as well.\n\nBy using the extensive search function you can take a look at what kind of files are shared. This helps you to make a proper estimation whether you want these files floating around, or if you need to revoke some permissions. Educating colleagues on other ways of sharing or a good conversation about a possible need of groups/shared drives is highly recommended when you identify a lot of shares using this method.\n\nSo, are you wondering how to check these habits thoroughly? Let’s deep dive into the extensive search functionality.\nIt can take a bit of effort, but you can reduce the risk of potential trouble: Educate people on sharing methods, create proper groups and shared drives and arrange clear agreements on- and offboarding when projects or collaborations end.\nHow to track where Google Drive files end up\nThere are two ways to track where data ends up. There is an extensive search functionality where you can search for data that matches specific criteria. However, if you want to analyze the data in less depth, there are some blocks that offer a clear overview as well.\n\nThe blocks with ‘sharing domains’ and ‘shared external’ offer a quick glance into your domain. They show – you guessed it – the domain files are shared with and with which mail addresses the most files are shared. The blocks are quite useful for three purposes:\n\n1) to have an overview of what’s happening within your domain,\n\n2) to identify where possible data exposure could occur and\n\n3) to track remarkable changes.\n\nThese graphs show you important information on the sharing habits of your domain. They identify the domains and users with which the most files are shared. Apparently, there are quite a few shares with personal email addresses (hotmail.com and gmail.com . And what about all those shares with @example.com? Is that collaboration still in place or should these permissions be withdrawn?\n\nDrive audit – the extensive search functionality\nThe extensive search function allows a more in depth insight into possible data exposure. It is useful to do some research on specific files or domains you’ve seen in the overview or to do some routine checks on specific terms or domains.\nThere are multiple filters available, the filters allow to search for files based on:\n\nName, file ID, shared drive location\nWho files are shared with\nThe file owner\nLocation: shared drives, my drives or orphaned\nExposure: anyone with the link , only domain with the link, restricted or not shared\nThe domain the files are shared with\nType of file (drive files like sheets, docs, forms and lot of other files like audio, video, Apps Scripts, Shortcuts and such as well)\nOr combine multiple of these filters at the same time.\n\nIdentified permissions that need to change? By using these filters you can create bulk actions with just a few clicks. This allows you to change permissions for multiple Google Drive files at once. Select the files you want to change permissions for, click on ‘add action’ in the upper right corner and change permissions immediately. (Read more about bulk actions and how to create them at this blog)\n\nAnd voila, you can monitor all file-sharing within your domain. Adopt a more in depth file sharing approach, just keep an eye on the file management of the domain or manage your data exposure extensively.\n\nShare this\nLinkedIn\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nGoogle Workspace management\n\nAbout us\nContact\nCareers\nAdmin Automation\nSecurity & Auditing\nEmail Signature Management\nStart for free\nGet a demo\nPartner\nGeneral Terms and Conditions\nPrivacy policy\nPrivacy Statement (App)"

        "value": "Totemism is an ancient type of religion that dates back to the early stages of human civilization. It is a religious system that is based on the belief that certain animals, plants, or natural objects have spiritual significance and are considered sacred or divine. Totemism is often associated with indigenous cultures and is found in various parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America. In this essay, we will explore the origins and characteristics of totemism, as well as its significance in different cultures.\n\nThe Origins of Totemism\n\nThe origins of totemism are unclear, but it is believed to have emerged during the Paleolithic era, which dates back to around 40,000 to 10,000 BCE. During this period, humans were primarily hunters and gatherers and lived in small groups. They relied heavily on the natural environment for survival and developed a close relationship with the plants and animals around them. It is believed that totemism emerged as a way to explain and understand the natural world and to establish a connection between humans and the environment.\n\nCharacteristics of Totemism\n\nTotemism is characterized by a belief in the spiritual significance of certain animals, plants, or natural objects, which are known as totems. These totems are often associated with clans or tribes, and members of a clan or tribe are believed to have a special relationship with their totem. Totems are often represented by images, symbols, or carvings, and are used in religious rituals and ceremonies.\n\nIn totemic societies, the totem is often seen as a protector and guide, and is believed to possess certain powers or qualities that can be passed on to members of the clan or tribe. For example, if the totem is an eagle, members of the clan or tribe may believe that they possess the eagle's sharp vision and ability to soar to great heights. In some cultures, totems are also believed to provide guidance and wisdom, and may be consulted in times of need or crisis.\n\nAnother characteristic of totemism is the belief in kinship with animals and plants. In many totemic cultures, animals and plants are seen as relatives or ancestors, and are treated with respect and reverence. Hunting and gathering practices are often accompanied by rituals and ceremonies to honor the animals and plants that are hunted or gathered, and to ensure that their spirits are not offended.\n\nSignificance of Totemism in Different Cultures\n\nTotemism has played a significant role in the cultures of many indigenous peoples around the world. In North America, for example, many Native American tribes have totemic traditions that are passed down from generation to generation. These totemic traditions often involve elaborate rituals and ceremonies, and are seen as an important part of the tribe's identity and cultural heritage.\n\nIn Australia, the Aboriginal people have a rich tradition of totemism, which is known as Dreamtime. Dreamtime is a complex system of beliefs and practices that is based on the idea that the world was created by ancestral beings, who are represented by totems. These totems are believed to have created the land, animals, and plants, and are seen as the source of life and energy.\n\nIn Africa, totemism is also an important part of many cultures. In some African societies, totems are associated with particular families or clans, and members of these clans are forbidden from eating or harming their totem animals or plants. In other African societies, totems are believed to have healing powers, and may be used in traditional medicine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, totemism is an ancient type of religion that is based on a belief in the spiritual significance of certain animals, plants, or natural objects. It is characterized by a belief in the kinship between humans and the natural"

There are several distinct types, each with its unique characteristics and applications. This guide will delve into the various types of pianos, discussing their features, advantages, and ideal uses.\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n\n1. [Grand Pianos](#grand-pianos)\n2. [Upright Pianos](#upright-pianos)\n3. [Digital Pianos](#digital-pianos)\n4. [Hybrid Pianos](#hybrid-pianos)\n5. [Player Pianos](#player-pianos)\n6. [Specialty Pianos](#specialty-pianos)\n7. [Selecting the Right Piano for Your Needs](#selecting-the-right-piano)\n8. [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n### Grand Pianos\n\n#### Introduction to Grand Pianos\n\nGrand pianos are the epitome of elegance and sophistication in the world of pianos. Their striking appearance and impressive sound have made them a staple in concert halls and professional recording studios.\n\n#### Anatomy of a Grand Piano\n\nGrand pianos are characterized by their horizontal, wing-shaped design. The strings and soundboard are positioned horizontally, which allows for more extended strings and greater sound projection.\n\n#### Types of Grand Pianos\n\nThere are several subcategories of grand pianos, each with distinct dimensions and tonal characteristics:\n\n1. Concert Grand: The largest and most powerful, concert grands are often used in professional concert settings. Typical sizes range from 7 to 10 feet in length.\n2. Semi-Concert Grand: Slightly smaller than concert grands, semi-concert grands typically measure between 6 and 7 feet in length, offering a balance between power and versatility.\n3. Baby Grand: With lengths of approximately 5 to 6 feet, baby grands are popular for their compact size and affordability without sacrificing sound quality.\n4. Petite Grand: The smallest of grand pianos, petite grands range from 4 to 5 feet in length, making them an excellent choice for those with limited space.\n\n### Upright Pianos\n\n#### Introduction to Upright Pianos\n\nUpright pianos, also known as vertical pianos, are a popular choice for home use due to their space-saving design and affordability. They provide a similar playing experience to grand pianos but with a more compact footprint.\n\n#### Anatomy of an Upright Piano\n\nIn an upright piano, the strings and soundboard are positioned vertically, which allows the instrument to be placed against a wall. The vertical design results in shorter strings and a smaller soundboard, leading to a slightly less resonant sound than a grand piano.\n\n#### Types of Upright Pianos\n\nUpright pianos come in various sizes, including:\n\n1. Studio: Studio upright pianos are the largest and offer the best sound quality. They typically measure between 45 and 48 inches in height.\n2. Console: Slightly smaller than studio uprights, console pianos usually range from 40 to 44 inches in height and are well-suited for home use.\n3. Spinet: The smallest of the upright pianos, spinets measure between 36 and 40 inches in height. They are popular for their compact size, but their sound quality may be somewhat compromised.\n\n### Digital Pianos\n\n#### Introduction to Digital Pianos\n\nDigital pianos are electronic instruments that replicate the sound and feel of acoustic pianos without the need for strings or a soundboard. They offer several advantages, such as port"

The skin samples were taken from the right abdominal stroma, left abdominal stroma, left groin area, and the third area of the abdomen.\n\nThe diagnosis indicates that there were four separate pigmented lesions identified, with each lesion being completely removed. Lesion 1 was diagnosed as a common wart (verruca vulgaris), and lesions 2, 3, and 4 were diagnosed as melanocytic nevi (moles).\n\nAs a surgeon and morphologist with 30 years of experience, my interpretation is that the removal of these pigmented lesions is likely a precautionary measure to prevent any potential for malignant transformation in the future. It is common practice to remove suspicious pigmented lesions as a preventative measure to minimize the risk of skin cancer."

It's your job to be authentic to yourself and to be as true to yourself as you possibly can be. And then, let that ripple outwards.\"\n\nOverall, Watson's experience shows that even people who are seen as successful and accomplished can struggle with self-doubt and imposter syndrome, and that seeking support and being true to oneself can help to overcome these feelings."

Instead of printing the response data, the code is logging a promise object.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can modify the code as follows:\n```javascript\nconst health = async () => {\n  const res = await fetch(\"https://api.1inch.io/swagger/ethereum-json\");\n  if (res.status == 200) {\n    const data = await res.json();\n    console.log(data);\n  }\n};\n```\nHere, the `res.json()` function returns a promise that we are awaiting, and then assigning the resulting data to a variable `data`. Finally, we are logging the `data` variable, which should contain the JSON response from the API."

The sum of frequencies is 40.\n\nSo the mean is:\n\nmean = 346 / 40 = 8.65\n\nStep 3: Calculate the deviation of each number of assistants from the mean by subtracting the mean from each number of assistants. The table below shows the deviations for each assistant level.\n\n| Number of assistants | Frequency | Deviation from mean |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | 0 | -6.65 |\n| 3 | 1 | -5.65 |\n| 4 | 3 | -4.65 |\n| 5 | 4 | -3.65 |\n| 6 | 6 | -2.65 |\n| 7 | 7 | -1.65 |\n| 8 | 10 | -0.65 |\n| 9 | 5 | 0.35 |\n| 10 | 3 | 1.35 |\n| 11 | 1 | 2.35 |\n\nStep 4: Calculate the squared deviation of each assistant level by squaring the deviation of each assistant level. The table below shows the squared deviations.\n\n| Number of assistants | Frequency | Deviation from mean | Squared deviation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | 0 | -6.65 | 44.2225 |\n| 3 | 1 | -5.65 | 31.9225 |\n| 4 | 3 | -4.65 | 21.6225 |\n| 5 | 4 | -3.65 | 13.3225 |\n| 6 | 6 | -2.65 | 7.0225 |\n| 7 | 7 | -1.65 | 2.7225 |\n| 8 | 10 | -0.65 | 0.4225 |\n| 9 | 5 | 0.35 | 0.1225 |\n| 10 | 3 | 1.35 | 1.8225 |\n| 11 | 1 | 2.35 | 5.5225 |\n\nStep 5: Calculate the sum of the squared deviations by adding up the squared deviation values in the previous table. In this case, the sum of squared deviations is 128.4225.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the variance by dividing the sum of squared deviations by the number of observations (i.e., the sum of the frequencies minus 1).

I want to make sure that all topic sentences actually establish a point that is clearly related to the thesis and that my plan in the outline presents a clear plan that supports each point and also defends each point, with concessions and counterargument, when appropriate. Please evaluate the following rough outline and make suggestions for improvement, if needed: A person's level of happiness is determined by their own choice and intentions. (Thesis)\nI. People can choose to be happy for the little things that happen in their lives.\n Concession: Some people may not have the choice to be happy for the little things in their lives. For example, someone that has experienced a traumatic event may not be able to find happiness.\nCounter Arguments \na. Focusing on the frequency of positive moments makes people happy.\no Keeps people happy in the long term\no Learning to be happy for the things already in your life\no For example: productive job, romantic partner, several hobbies or interests (Road to happiness/ John Reich and Ed Diener)\no Frequency, not intensity (Ed Diener)\nb. Not waiting for big positive moments to come by\no Waiting may lead to disappointment\no Only lasts for a short period of time\nc. The amount of gratitude a happy person has\no Expressing gratitude makes you happy\n Craig DeMartino (Kathleen McGowan)\no Study on showing gratitude for the people around you (The Science of Happiness)\nII. A happy person chooses to see the positive side of things.\n Concession: On the other hand, some people might argue that a person that always sees only the positive may become gullible to deceit.\na. However, people will not ignore their difficulties/adversities but overcome them.\no John Keats story (Eric G. Wilson)\no Trauma\no Bullying\no Rape(Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\no Sexuality (Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\n Denied housing or jobs, marriage rights, violence, hate crimes\nb. People will use the pain and suffering to learn and become stronger.\no Form your own identity/ meaning(Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\no Making our difficulties purposeful\no Being proud of who you are because of the adversities\no Learning from them\nIII. To gain happiness people’s perspectives need to change. \n Concession: Some people may find that altering their outlook on life does not lead to happiness because they may be stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. Focusing too much on achieving happiness can cause feelings of guilt and pressure, leading to further unhappiness. \na. In spite of this, changing how you see social media can help reduce feelings of guilt and pressure. \no Choosing to not feel bad about your life because of what other people post online\no Choosing to disregard or ignore bad comments about yourself \nb. Surrounding yourself in a positive environment will have a major impact on your mindset.\no How you perceive the events happening around you\n The negatives\no Taking in the emotions around\n Surrounding yourself with good and happy vibes\no How you think people perceive you\nIV. A person can create his or her own happiness by intentionally engaging in activities and training their minds.\n Concession: However, some people may be predisposed to happiness or unhappiness due to their genes.\na. Training the mind to be happy can be an effective way to increase overall wellbeing.\no Tomato sauce (Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce Malcolm Gladwell)\nb. Intentional activity can help people gain happiness by focusing on positive experiences, prioritizing meaningful goals and activities, and cultivating relationships with others.\no Knowing what makes you happy\no Practicing/ acting those things (John Reich)\no People can create their own stories ( Emily Smith)\no acts of kindness(Lyubomirsky)\nV. Happy people chose to have a purposeful life. \n Concession: A purposeful life does not necessarily equate to a happy life. One can have a purposeful life and still be unhappy.\na. Four pillars of leading to a meaningful life ( Emily Smith)\no Belonging\no Purpose\no Transcendence \no Storytelling\nb. Relationships and friendships are a key part of having a fulfilling life, and having a purpose helps to keep us motivated and driven.\no what kind of people around you/ supportive people\n surround yourself with people that are positive\n giving or helping others makes you happy(Todd B. Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener)\no Deriving meaningful relationships or purpose at work or in what you do\n Example TED talk (Chip Conley) maid\nVI. Happy people make conscious decisions to take care of their physical and mental wellbeing by eating nutritious food, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. They also tend to be more mindful, focusing on the present moment and being more aware of their thoughts and emotions.\n Concession: Other people, however, may not be able to make these choices due to outside stressors, and may not have the time or resources to do so.\na. People who suffer from an injury or illness still have ability to choose how much happiness they acquire. They can choose to focus on the positive aspects of the situation, or they can choose to dwell on the negative. Whatever they choose will have a direct effect on their overall wellbeing.\no Kris Carr diagnosed with cancer (Carlin Flora)\no Bobby Muller’s experience ( Kathleen McGowan)\no Tracy Cyr ( Kathleen McGowan)\nb. With a strong sense of motivation, we are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and joy when we achieve our goals, leading to increased feelings of happiness.\no Doing things that may be difficult but will bring you closer to being happy\n Exercise\n Journaling\n Eating Healthy\no Leo Babauta (Carlin Flora)\no Meditation"

However, there are a few areas where you might consider making some adjustments or additions to strengthen your argument:\n\n1. Clarify the meaning of \"choice and intentions\" in the thesis statement. It might be helpful to define these terms more specifically or provide examples to help readers understand what you mean.\n2. Provide more detailed evidence and examples to support some of your arguments, particularly in the \"counter arguments\" section. For example, you could include specific studies or real-world examples to back up your claims about the importance of gratitude or the benefits of focusing on small positive moments.\n3. Consider adding more discussion about the potential limitations or challenges of some of the strategies you suggest for achieving happiness. For example, you mention that focusing too much on achieving happiness can lead to guilt and pressure, but you could also explore other potential drawbacks of this approach (e.g., the potential for over-reliance on external sources of happiness).\n4. Make sure that your concessions and counterarguments are well-supported and address potential weaknesses in your arguments. In some cases, it might be helpful to include additional evidence or examples to strengthen these points.\n\nOverall, your outline appears to be a strong foundation for an argumentative paper on happiness.

        "value": "The equation you are referring to is known as the \"critical speed\" equation and is commonly used in vehicle dynamics and racing to determine the maximum safe speed that a vehicle can take through a turn. The equation is:\n\nv = sqrt(a\\_lat / k)\n\nWhere:\n\n* v is the critical speed\n* a\\_lat is the maximum lateral acceleration that the vehicle can achieve without losing traction\n* k is the radius of curvature of the turn\n\nThe intuitive explanation for this equation is that it relates the speed that a vehicle can safely take a turn to the balance between the centripetal force required to keep the vehicle on the curve and the maximum lateral force that the tires can generate without losing grip.\n\nWhen a vehicle takes a turn, it experiences a centripetal force that keeps it on the curve. This force is proportional to the square of the vehicle's speed and inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of the turn (k). At the same time, the vehicle is subject to lateral forces that are generated by the tires and depend on the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road surface. If the lateral force exceeds the maximum grip limit of the tires, the vehicle will slide or skid out of the turn.\n\nThe critical speed equation relates the maximum lateral force that the tires can generate (a\\_lat) to the centripetal force required to stay on the curve (v^2 / k). The square root arises because the maximum lateral force (a\\_lat) is proportional to the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road surface, while the centripetal force (v^2 / k) is proportional to the square of the speed.\n\nTherefore, the critical speed is the speed at which the lateral force required to stay on the curve (v^2 / k) is equal to the maximum lateral force that the tires can generate (a\\_lat). If the vehicle exceeds this speed, it will lose traction and slide out of the turn."

We'll use a `ConstraintLayout` with a `RecyclerView`:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView\n        android:id=\"@+id/recycler_view\"\n        android:layout_width=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"0dp\"\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=\"parent\" />\n\n    <com.google.android.material.floatingactionbutton.FloatingActionButton\n        android:id=\"@+id/add_button\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_margin=\"16dp\"\n        android:contentDescription=\"@string/add_button\"\n        android:src=\"@drawable/ic_add\"\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\"parent\" />\n\n</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>\n```\nAs you can see, we've added a `FloatingActionButton` to the layout which will be used to add new items to the list.\n\nNext, let's create a data model class to represent each item in the list:\n```java\npublic class Item {\n    private String name;\n\n    public Item(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n```\nWe'll also need an adapter to display the items in the `RecyclerView`. Here's the code for the adapter:\n```java\npublic class ItemAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<ItemAdapter.ViewHolder> {\n    private List<Item> items;\n\n    public ItemAdapter(List<Item> items) {\n        this.items = items;\n    }\n\n    @NonNull\n    @Override\n    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())\n                .inflate(R.layout.item_row, parent, false);\n        return new ViewHolder(view);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull ViewHolder holder, int position) {\n        holder.nameTextView.setText(items.get(position).getName());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return items.size();\n    }\n\n    public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        public TextView nameTextView;\n\n        public ViewHolder(View view) {\n            super(view);\n            nameTextView = view.findViewById(R.id.name_text_view);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nWe've also created a layout file for the row layout that will be used to display each item in the list:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:padding=\"16dp\">\n\n    <TextView\n        android:id=\"@\n```"

Clarify constraints: Ask the interviewer about any constraints you need to consider when designing the system, such as performance requirements, scalability, availability, or security.\n3. Propose solutions: Propose a high-level solution to the problem, and ask the interviewer for feedback. Be prepared to explain your reasoning and assumptions behind your proposed solution.\n4. Discuss trade-offs: Discuss trade-offs between different design options and ask the interviewer for their opinion on which approach is better suited for the given requirements.\n5. Discuss scalability: Ask the interviewer about how they envision the system scaling over time and what measures would be necessary to ensure the system can handle increased traffic.\n6. Discuss fault tolerance: Ask the interviewer about how they would like the system to handle failures, such as hardware failures or network outages.\n7. Discuss security: Ask the interviewer about any security concerns for the system and how you can design the system to mitigate these risks.\n8. Ask for feedback: At the end of the interview, ask the interviewer for feedback on your design and any areas where you could improve. This will help you learn and grow from the experience.\n\nRemember to be professional and polite during the interview, and avoid asking overly technical questions unless the interviewer is explicitly seeking that information. Good luck with your system design interview!"

        "value": "The iterator pattern should be used when you need to traverse a collection of objects in a way that allows you to access each object without exposing the underlying data structure of the collection.\n\nThe iterator pattern is especially useful when you are working with large or complex data structures and you want to be able to iterate over the collection without having to write complex code to manage the traversal. It can also be used when you want to provide a common interface for traversing different types of collections.\n\nSome scenarios where you might want to use the iterator pattern include:\n\n1. When you need to iterate over the elements of a collection in a specific order, such as alphabetical or numerical order.\n2. When you need to iterate over a subset of the elements in a collection, such as only the elements that meet a certain criteria.\n3. When you need to iterate over a collection that is being modified by other parts of your program at the same time.\n4. When you want to provide a common interface for iterating over different types of collections, such as lists, sets, and maps.\n\nOverall, the iterator pattern provides a way to iterate over a collection of objects in a simple and efficient manner, while also providing a layer of abstraction that makes it easier to work with complex data structures."

There are two types of proxy servers: forward proxy and reverse proxy.\n\nA forward proxy, also known as a client-side proxy, is a server that sits between a client and the internet. It is used to provide anonymity to clients by hiding their IP addresses from the server they are accessing. In other words, when a client requests a resource from a server through a forward proxy, the server only sees the IP address of the proxy server, not the IP address of the client.\n\nOn the other hand, a reverse proxy, also known as a server-side proxy, is a server that sits between a server and the internet. It is used to protect servers from external attacks by acting as a barrier between the internet and the server. In other words, when a client requests a resource from a server through a reverse proxy, the request first goes through the reverse proxy server, which then forwards the request to the server. The server only sees the IP address of the reverse proxy server, not the IP address of the client.\n\nReverse proxies are often used for load balancing, caching, and SSL/TLS termination. They can improve performance by caching frequently accessed resources and distributing incoming requests across multiple servers. They can also provide security benefits by protecting servers from DDoS attacks and hiding internal IP addresses."

Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album’s title refers to the “aubade”, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n\nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a “fruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.” Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass... more\ncredits\nreleased February 4, 2022\n\n \n\n \n\nMKX\\_300dpi\n\n \n\nCerys Weetch\n\nLabel / A&R Manager\n\nMercury KX, 4 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\n\nM: +44 (0)7792959309\n\nwww.mercurykx.com\n\n---"

Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n\nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n\n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n\nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Saëns' left hand études religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n\n\n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n\nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n\n\n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n\nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's études - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate études to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire étude for left hand solo.\n\n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n\nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n\n\n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n\nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n\n\n7. Diversions - Britten\n\nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n\n\n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n\nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n\n9. Six études for the left hand - Saint-Saëns\n\nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Saëns' piano études are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n\n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n\nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano."

English pop singer Ellie Goulding has cited Blais as an inspiration for her fourth album.[1]\n\nHis debut studio album Il was released in April 2016 on Arts & Crafts, garnering critical acclaim, including making Time magazine's top ten albums of the year list.[2] In 2017, he collaborated with Grammy-nominated English-Canadian electronic artist CFCF on the EP Cascades. His sophomore album, Dans ma main, was released on 11 May 2018, also on Arts & Crafts, and on 30 November 2018 Jean-Michel released Eviction Sessions.\nContents\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n2.1 2016: Il\n2.2 2017: Cascades\n2.3 2018: Dans ma main\n2.4 Eviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\nEarly life\nJean-Michel Blais grew up in the rural town of Nicolet, Quebec.[3] As a young boy, his parents influenced his love of music. While not serious musicians, his father sang in a choir as a child, and his mother would play the organ.[4] Blais began his musical adventures by \"drumming with pots and pans [and] mix-taping Radio-Canada \"world\" music, traditional, Celtic, [Andean], and Eastern European [music]\".[3]\n\nAs a teenager, he took piano lessons, eventually studying at the Trois-Rivières Music Conservatory. However, he found the academic world of music exhausting and restrictive, so he left after two years to travel.[4]\n\nHe travelled to Guatemala, spending several months there working at an orphanage.[4] Looking again for a change, he then moved to Berlin for a year, and then went to South America, spending time in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Finally, Blais decided to settle in Montreal, pursuing a career as a special education teacher.[5] He completed a degree in liberal arts with a minor in psychology while focusing his studies on special education. After graduating, he worked with children with disabilities and behavioural disorders for five years at CEGEP level.\n\nCareer\n2016: Il\nWhile working in special education, Blais slowly rediscovered a fondness for improvising and composing. Blais constructed his debut album, Il, over the course of two years. It was recorded in two days in Blais' apartment with a Zoom recorder, allowing the ambience of his apartment to come through on the recording.[4]\n\nIf people are going to cough and babies are going to cry, instead of trying to hide it, why not embrace it? I like it when I stop and there's something happening outside my window. I think that's why my music has a lot of pauses and silences, because there's always something happening in the street. I'll let it pass and then continue playing.\n\n— Jean-Michel Blais in an interview with the Montreal Gazette[6]\nBlais communicated via Facebook with his friend Devon Bate, credited on the album as BUFFLO, to mix the album. The recording was done in such a manner that the listener feels surrounded by the music.[7] Blais originally released the album via Bandcamp in 2015, where it was discovered by Arts & Crafts, and subsequently given a proper release on 8 April 2016. Arts & Crafts also released the sheet music for the album, along with a deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks that was released in October 2016.[8] The album was widely acclaimed, ranking 10th on Time Magazine's Top 10 Albums of 2016.[2] Exclaim! gave the album 9/10, writing, \"Simply put, Il is a masterpiece.\"[9]\n\n2017: Cascades\nMichael Silver (a.k.a. CFCF) and Blais first collaborated when the Red Bull Music Academy sponsored a live performance featuring the two artists. Blais and Silver found that they lived around the corner from each other, then started finding similarities in their music and composition style.[10] Cascades features two songs each of their solo works, reworked as a duo, and a cover of John Cage's In a Landscape (1948).\nI thought [Jean-Michel's music] was beautiful... I just loved it a bunch, especially because it's so different from a lot of the other piano music that I had tended to listen to...\n\n— Michael Silver (CFCF)\nCascades was also met with critical acclaim. For Pitchfork, Andy Beta opined that it \"finds Silver and Blais warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record's end,\" and called the duo's version of \"In a Landscape\", \"one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable\".[11] Exclaim! also highlighted Blais and Silver's chemistry, reasoning that \"Blais' playing suits very well the pristine and glossy production Silver employed for those recordings, injecting it with a real sense of purpose here,\" giving the album an 8/10.[12]\n\n2018: Dans ma main\nDans ma main is Blais' sophomore solo record, released via Arts & Crafts on 11 May 2018. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10 in an early review, writing \"Far from spiralling inward, as always, Blais lets it all flow through him, and as private becomes public, the result is yet another intimate masterpiece\".[13] On the album, he experiments with different synth and electronic textures, a concept introduced to him while working with CFCF.\n\nBlais explained in a conversation with CFCF and Red Bull Music Academy, \"I never want to lose contact with the original piano instrument, but we have so many tools now to treat it differently than to just have the instrument on its own, so why not use them, and how? It certainly is opening. It gives me sounds and texture possibilities\".[14] The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.[15] In August 2019, Blais released an EP of remixes of Dans ma main.[16]\n\nEviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\nEviction Sessions is Blais' third project, released via Arts & Crafts on 30 November 2018.

Today, I want to talk about the acting skills of actor Simbu.\n\nSimbu, also known as Silambarasan, is a popular actor in the Tamil film industry. He made his acting debut in the early 2000s and has since appeared in numerous films.\n\nOne of the things that sets Simbu apart from other actors is his versatility. He has played a wide range of roles, from romantic leads to action heroes to comedic characters. He has also demonstrated his singing and dancing skills in several films.\n\nDespite his success, Simbu has faced criticism for his acting skills. Some have said that he overacts in certain scenes, and that he struggles to portray emotion effectively.\n\nHowever, I believe that Simbu's acting skills should not be underestimated. In many of his films, he has shown a remarkable ability to convey emotion through his facial expressions and body language. He has also demonstrated a strong understanding of character development and has made some truly memorable performances.\n\nOverall, I think Simbu is a talented actor who has much to offer. While he may have room for improvement, he is certainly worth watching and deserves recognition for his contributions to the Tamil film industry.\n\nNarrator: That's all for this review of Simbu's acting skills. Thank you for watching."

The exercise was approximately 1.5 hours long and provided a unique opportunity for us to work together as a team to analyze and communicate information, make decisions, and respond to challenges.\n\nAt the beginning of the exercise, we were provided with information about the weather conditions, health conditions, supplies, goals, and hiking speed. We were tasked with determining how much of this information to communicate to our teammates and how it would impact our journey. Throughout the exercise, we encountered 3 hidden challenges that affected our ascent, hiking speed, health, and overall success.\n\nThe experience was incredibly valuable in teaching us the importance of effective communication and collaboration. It was clear that when we worked together, sharing information and making decisions as a team, we were able to overcome the challenges and reach our goals more effectively. On the other hand, when we failed to communicate effectively or made decisions without considering the input of all team members, we faced significant difficulties and setbacks.\n\nAdditionally, the exercise reinforced the importance of adaptability and flexibility in achieving success. As we encountered new challenges, we had to quickly reassess our plans and adjust our strategy in order to overcome the obstacles and reach our goals. This taught us the value of being able to pivot and adjust in response to changing circumstances, a critical skill in any team environment.\n\nOverall, I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this exercise and I believe that it will have a lasting impact on my ability to work effectively in a team setting. I am eager to apply the lessons I learned to future team projects and I believe that my experiences will help me to be a more effective team player in the future.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to reflect on this valuable experience.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"

Well, let me tell you, that's just not true. There are some composers who stand head and shoulders above the rest, and today, I want to talk about three of them: Bach, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn.\n\nNow, Bach and Beethoven, they're the real deal. They're the kings of classical music. Their music is like a fire that burns deep in your soul. It's powerful, it's moving, it's everything that music should be.\n\nAnd then there's Mozart. Now, I know some people out there love Mozart, but let's be real, his music just doesn't have the same depth as Bach and Beethoven. It's like he was trying to be flashy and showy, but he never really dug deep. He just didn't have that same fire in his belly.\n\nBut let's talk about Mendelssohn. Now, this guy, he gets it. He follows in the footsteps of Bach and Beethoven, but he's not afraid to blaze his own trail. His music is like a breath of fresh air, a new take on the classics. He's the real deal.\n\nAnd then there are other great composers like Brahms and Rachmaninoff. These guys knew how to bring the heat. Their music is like a raging inferno, consuming everything in its path. They knew how to take the classical tradition and make it their own.\n\nSo, my fellow Americans, let's celebrate the greats like Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Brahms, and Rachmaninoff. Let's remember that music is not just a bunch of notes on a page, but it's a reflection of our very souls. And if we want to keep that fire burning bright, we need to keep listening to the best of the best. Thank you, and God bless America!"

Many students choose to use their gap year to work or intern in a legal setting, such as a law firm, government agency, or non-profit organization. This type of experience can provide valuable insight into the legal profession and help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in law school.\n\nAnother benefit of a gap year before law school is the opportunity to travel and explore the world. Many students use their gap year to visit different countries, learn about new cultures, and broaden their horizons. This can be a valuable experience for law students, as it can help them become more well-rounded and open-minded.\n\nA gap year can also provide students with the opportunity to take a break from academia and recharge their batteries. Law school can be demanding, both intellectually and emotionally, and a gap year can provide students with the time and space they need to relax and refocus before starting their law degree.\n\nIn addition to the benefits mentioned above, a gap year before law school can also help students make more informed decisions about their future careers. By gaining practical experience and exploring the world, students can learn more about their interests, strengths, and weaknesses, and use this knowledge to choose a law specialty that is right for them.\n\nOverall, a gap year before law school can be a valuable and rewarding experience for students. It can provide them with practical experience, new perspectives, and the opportunity to take a break from academia before embarking on their law degree. Students who take a gap year before law school may find that they are better prepared and more motivated to succeed in law school and in their future careers."

        "value": "Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a possible web project structure with Python that you can use to evaluate different machine learning algorithms using Django as the backend:\n\n1. Create a Django project:\nFirst, you need to create a new Django project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\ndjango-admin startproject project_name\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `project_name` with a few files inside.\n2. Create a Django app:\nNext, you need to create a Django app to handle the machine learning functionality. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n```\npython manage.py startapp ml\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `ml` inside your project directory.\n3. Create a model:\nInside the `ml` app, create a new file called `models.py`. In this file, define a model that will hold the results of your machine learning algorithms. For example:\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MLResult(models.Model):\n    algorithm_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    result = models.FloatField()\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.algorithm_name} - {self.result}\"\n```\nThis model has two fields: `algorithm_name` (a string field to store the name of the algorithm) and `result` (a float field to store the result of the algorithm).\n4. Create views:\nInside the `ml` app, create a new file called `views.py`. In this file, define views that will handle the machine learning functionality. For example:\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom django.views.generic import FormView\nfrom .forms import AlgorithmForm\nfrom .models import MLResult\n\nclass AlgorithmFormView(FormView):\n    template_name = \"ml/form.html\"\n    form_class = AlgorithmForm\n    success_url = \"/\"\n\n    def form_valid(self, form):\n        algorithm_name = form.cleaned_data[\"algorithm_name\"]\n        result = form.run_algorithm()\n        MLResult.objects.create(algorithm_name=algorithm_name, result=result)\n        return super().form_valid(form)\n```\nThis view handles a form submission from a template called `form.html`, which contains a form that allows the user to select an algorithm and input data. When the form is submitted, the view runs the selected algorithm on the input data and saves the result to the database.\n5. Create forms:\nInside the `ml` app, create a new file called `forms.py`. In this file, define a form that will be used to select an algorithm and input data. For example:\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nclass AlgorithmForm(forms.Form):\n    algorithm_choices = [(\"linear_regression\", \"Linear Regression\")]\n\n    algorithm_name = forms.ChoiceField(choices=algorithm_choices)\n    data = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)\n\n    def run_algorithm(self):\n        algorithm_name = self.cleaned_data[\"algorithm_name\"]\n        data = self.cleaned_data[\"data\"]\n        data = [float(x) for x in data.split(\",\")]\n\n        if algorithm_name == \"linear_regression\":\n            model = LinearRegression()\n            model.fit([[x] for x in range(len(data))], data)\n            return model.predict([[len(data)]])\n\n        return None\n```\nThis form has a choice field for selecting an algorithm and a textarea field for inputting data. When the form is submitted, the `run_algorithm` method is called, which runs the selected algorithm on the input data and returns the result.\n6. Create templates:\nInside the `ml"

        "value": "SQL Joins:\n\nSQL Joins are used to combine two or more tables in a database based on a common column between them. There are four types of SQL Joins: Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, and Full Join.\n\n1. Inner Join: An Inner Join returns only the matching rows from both tables.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". Both tables have a common column called \"CustomerID\". To get the details of the customers who have placed orders, we can use an Inner Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nINNER JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n1. Left Join: A Left Join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there are no matching rows in the right table, then NULL values are returned.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". To get the details of all customers and their orders, we can use a Left Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nLEFT JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n1. Right Join: A Right Join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there are no matching rows in the left table, then NULL values are returned.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". To get the details of all orders and their corresponding customers, we can use a Right Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nRIGHT JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n1. Full Join: A Full Join returns all the rows from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there are no matches.\n\nExample: Suppose we have two tables, \"Customers\" and \"Orders\". To get the details of all customers and all orders, we can use a Full Join like this:\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nFULL JOIN Orders\nON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\nSQL Views:\n\nSQL Views are virtual tables that do not store data themselves but represent the data stored in other tables. They are created by using a SELECT statement and can be used to simplify complex queries, hide sensitive data, and provide a simpler interface for end-users.\n\nExample: Suppose we have a table \"Employees\" with columns \"EmployeeID\", \"FirstName\", \"LastName\", \"Salary\", and \"DepartmentID\". To create a view that displays the names and salaries of employees in each department, we can use this code:\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW EmployeeSalaries AS\nSELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Employees.Salary, Departments.DepartmentName\nFROM Employees\nINNER JOIN Departments\nON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;\n```\nOnce the view is created, we can use it like a regular table to retrieve data:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM EmployeeSalaries;\n```\nSQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs):\n\nSQL Common Table Expressions are temporary result sets that are defined within a single execution of a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They can be used to simplify complex queries, improve performance, and make code more readable.\n\nExample: Suppose we have a table \"Orders\" with columns \"OrderID\", \"CustomerID\", \"OrderDate\", and \"OrderTotal\". To create a CTE that returns the total sales for each customer, we can use this code:\n```vbnet\nWITH CustomerSales AS (\nSELECT CustomerID, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSales\nFROM Orders\nGROUP BY CustomerID\n)\nSELECT Customers.CustomerName, CustomerSales.TotalSales\nFROM Customers\n```"

Here is an example of how you can do this:\n```\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <!-- include plotly.js library -->\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <!-- render the tree diagram -->\n    <div id=\"plot\"></div>\n    <script>\n      // get the Figure object from the template context\n      var fig = {{ plot|tojson }};\n\n      // render the Figure object as an interactive tree diagram\n      Plotly.newPlot('plot', fig.data, fig.layout);\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nI hope this helps!

The concept of gravity has been understood by humans for thousands of years, and people have been aware of its effects on the motion of objects for even longer.\n\nBefore the scientific understanding of gravity, people observed the way objects moved and developed explanations for these movements based on their observations and their cultural and religious beliefs. For example, ancient civilizations believed that the gods controlled the movement of the planets and stars, and that the earth was the center of the universe.\n\nAs humans learned more about the natural world, they began to develop more scientific explanations for the way objects moved. The Greek philosopher Aristotle, for example, proposed the idea that there were different kinds of matter that moved naturally in different ways, with some matter tending to move downward toward the center of the earth.\n\nIt wasn't until the work of Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century that the concept of gravity as we understand it today began to take shape. Newton proposed that the force of gravity was a universal force that acted between any two objects with mass, and that it was responsible for the way objects moved and behaved. His work laid the foundation for the modern understanding of gravity and its role in the universe."

To start the scheduler, open a new terminal window and run: `airflow scheduler`.\n4. Access Airflow web interface - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Airflow web interface.\n5. Create a DAG - Now that Airflow is running, you can create your own DAGs. A simple way to get started is by copying the example DAGs from the `airflow/example_dags` directory to `~/airflow/dags`.\n\nThat's it! You have successfully set up and run Apache Airflow locally."

The `bins` parameter specifies the number of buckets, and the `labels=False` parameter indicates that the resulting bucket labels should be integers starting from 0.

Beijing’s theory of victory in this clash is that its combination of strategic planning, manufacturing prowess, and a huge market will undermine foreign innovation, insulate the party from American pressure, and arm Beijing with more tools of economic coercion. This could also force more deindustrialization in the U.S.\n\nIf American policy makers and the private sector want to avoid this fate, considerable decoupling must occur. The U.S. will need to revise its economic strategy or it will continue on a course toward asymmetric dependence on China. This must start with changes to the world’s wealthiest national economy. The low-cost consumption that Americans enjoy through trade with China will have to give way so that more reliable production is a priority. This will cause some short-term economic pain, but it is protection against China’s inevitable disruptions of future American consumption.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has already pushed the private sector in this direction. Government policy must now codify and amplify the shift. These policies cannot be pushed through by executive fiat; they require a bipartisan consensus and new or modified law.\n\nSome production will need to leave China so the U.S. can exchange cheap goods for greater economic resilience. A new economic strategy will mix producing more in North America with importing goods from trustworthy trading partners. There is already bipartisan support for boosting production at home—the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act is the best example to date.\n\nThe international component of American strategy is more difficult because there is bipartisan support for protectionism as well. To tackle this problem, Washington should consider updating free-trade agreements, complex as that will be, after exploring narrower, sector-specific agreements for crucial supply chains and creating bilateral technology agreements. All of these measures should get congressional approval.\nTLDR;"

What I like best about Notion is how it can understand my natural language queries and create dynamic pages that adapt to my needs. For example, I can ask Notion to create a to-do list for me and it will automatically populate it with tasks from different sources, like emails, calendar events, and project boards. I can also ask Notion to summarize a long article or book and it will generate a concise summary that I can save for later reference.\n\nAnother thing I appreciate about Notion is how flexible and customizable it is. I can create different types of pages, like databases, wikis, journals, or project plans, and tailor them to my own workflow and preferences. I can add custom properties, formulas, filters, and views to make my data more structured and useful. I can also share my pages with others and collaborate in real-time, which is very convenient for team projects.\n\nAs for what I dislike about Notion, I would say that the learning curve can be steep at first. Notion has a lot of features and options, and it can take some time to figure out how to use them effectively. Some of the documentation and tutorials could be more clear and concise, especially for advanced topics. Also, while Notion AI is very powerful, it's not perfect and sometimes it can misinterpret my queries or generate inaccurate summaries. However, I think these are minor issues compared to the overall benefits of using Notion."

Please consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic and unpredictable disease affecting the central nervous system. It is characterized by the immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers, leading to communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\nThe impact of MS on a person's life and prognosis can vary greatly depending on several factors, such as the type of MS, the severity and location of lesions, the effectiveness of treatments, and individual responses to the disease.\n\n1. Types of MS: There are four primary types of MS, which can influence the prognosis and quality of life. These include:\n* Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): Most common form with clearly defined relapses followed by periods of remission. Generally, a more favorable prognosis.\n* Secondary progressive MS (SPMS): A majority of people with RRMS eventually transition to SPMS, characterized by a steady worsening of the disease.\n* Primary progressive MS (PPMS): Characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms from the beginning, with no distinct relapses or remissions. Prognosis is generally less favorable.\n* Progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS): A rare form of MS, characterized by a steady worsening of the disease from the outset, with occasional relapses.\n1. Lesions and symptoms: The severity and location of brain lesions can influence the impact of MS on an individual's life. In your case, the initial symptoms include loss of feeling in part of the face and arm, which could be indicative of lesions affecting the sensory pathways in the brain. Other symptoms could include vision problems, muscle weakness, balance and coordination issues, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. The progression of these symptoms can vary greatly between individuals.\n2. Treatment effectiveness: The effectiveness of treatments, such as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), can influence the quality of life and prognosis. These medications aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow disease progression, and manage symptoms. Early treatment can improve the prognosis, but individual responses to treatment can vary.\n3. Lifestyle factors: Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management, and adequate sleep, can help improve the quality of life for people with MS. Rehabilitation therapies, such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy, can also help manage symptoms and maintain functional abilities.\n\nIn summary, the prognosis and quality of life for someone with multiple sclerosis can vary greatly depending on the type of MS, the severity and location of lesions, treatment effectiveness, and individual factors. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and to develop an appropriate treatment plan."

Meaning: Data lacks meaning, whereas information has meaning. Data is just a collection of facts and figures, while information provides context and interpretation to those facts and figures.\n2. Form: Data can take many forms, such as numbers, text, images, audio, and video, whereas information is typically presented in a more structured and organized form, such as tables, graphs, charts, and reports.\n3. Purpose: The purpose of data is to collect and store information, while the purpose of information is to provide insight and knowledge that can be used for decision-making, analysis, and problem-solving.\n4. Relevance: Data can be irrelevant or redundant, whereas information is always relevant and useful. Data can be collected without a specific purpose, while information is always collected with a specific goal in mind.\n5. Usefulness: Data alone is not useful until it is processed, analyzed, and interpreted. On the other hand, information is immediately useful and valuable because it provides insights that can help in decision-making.\n6. Processing: Data requires processing to turn it into information. Processing can include cleaning, transforming, aggregating, and analyzing data to extract insights and meaning.\n7. Scope: Data is generally considered to be a smaller subset of information. Information is often made up of many different pieces of data, combined and analyzed to provide insights.\n8. Context: Data lacks context, while information is presented in context. Information is presented in a way that helps to understand the data and its relevance in a specific context.\n\nIn conclusion, while data and information are related concepts, they are distinct and serve different purposes. Data is raw, unprocessed facts, while information is the result of processing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make it meaningful and useful. The ultimate goal of collecting data is to turn it into useful information that can help in decision-making and problem-solving."

This design provides a highly scalable and resilient network, as adding more endpoints or switches is simply a matter of adding more leaf switches or spine switches.\n\nIn the ACI fabric specifically, the leaf-spine topology is used to provide a highly scalable and efficient infrastructure for deploying applications, while also simplifying network management through centralized policy control.

        "value": "Please write this in the style of Hemingway: Looking out from the nest of this osprey HAWK family on a bright sunny morning Joey watched as a group of EAGLES fished off of a gleaming white sand bar gently lapped by blu-ish green waters of the bay. The EAGLES fluttered, hopped and scurried about in the bubbly white surf, their chatter and song filling the tropical sea air and Joey’s young mind. \n\nJoey was about the same age as the youthful EAGLES out there on the sand bar. Those EA-GLES had dark feathers like Joey as they had not developed the white head and tail feathers of the older bald EAGLES. Joey did not look at all like Livie, his brightly colored osprey sister who was older than Joey. \n\nJoey felt a gentle morning breeze as he looked out along his broad wings colored dark grey with white mottling. The breeze raised up the ends of the contour feathers along the leading edge of Joey’s wings and slightly ruffled his long wing tip primary feathers. Joey wondered if his wings would sustain his flight on great thermal air currents on his dream to soar all the way up to the top of the sky.\n\nAfter noontime Joey watched as the EAGLES lifted slowly upward in flapping flight high above their bay world of sand, sea, and tropical keys until they were soaring on warm upwelling thermal currents. With their wings fully outstretched they spiraled higher and higher upward.\n\nAs Joey watched the EAGLES with intense admiration they slowly soared through misty white vapor into a billowing and radiant cumulus cloud that floated above in the vast ocean of blue sky. Then all of the EAGLES disappeared into the cloud. \n\nJoey's head swam with dizzying visions of soaring way up there into white towering clouds. \n\n“One day soon I will surely soar to the top of the sky like those EAGLES,” thought Joey.\n\nThen Joey heard a rushing and fluttering of wing feathers and turned his head to see a long-winged bird turn into the wind and level out on a glide directly toward him. With its great wings fully outstretched and its tail fanned and lowered, this winsomely white bird cut a strik-ing figure as it loomed upon the nest. \n\nThe great bird stretched its head and long white legs with taloned feet forward and raised its wings up and back with long primary feathers splayed. The bird seized onto a thick branch at the edge of the nest and tipped forward unstably. Then it quickly rotated its wings revealing a distinctive bold patterning of brown and black across their undersides as the bird recovered to an upright position. \n\n“Ahoy there my little avian predator!” exclaimed the bird as she folded her long wings and set-tled into a resting position at the edge of the nest. \n\n“Hello Livie,” replied Joey still crouched in the thicket of the large protective nest.\n\n“And what kind of day is our youngest raptor having?” asked Joey’s sister Livie. \n\n“I have been watching the EAGLES, Livie,” replied Joey. “They were fishing, playing, and sunning out there on that sand bar and the key just beyond it. Then the EAGLES went soaring right up into those clouds.” \n\n“I want to soar up there to the top of the sky!” exclaimed Joey. “Would you like to go soaring with me, Livie?”\n\n“Sure Joey, in a while,” replied Livie. \n\nThen Joey began dragging a favorite stick across the nest bed. \n\n“You’re such a kid Joey!” exclaimed Livie as she hopped down into the nest and grabbed the other end of the stick with her bill engaging Joey in a friendly game of tug of war. \n\nJoey pulled his stick free from Livie's grasp and won the tug. Then Livie picked up a tuft of grass from the nest bed and playfully tossed it at Joey. \n\n“Oh Joey I remember you always romping and playing on the nest with some odd shaped sticks and sea shells,” said Livie. “Those were some of your favorite toys and you would spend count-less hours leaping upon them, pecking at them, caressing them, tossing them into the air and then catching them with your feet before they hit the nest.“\n\n“I know that Livie, but now I just want to go soaring. Will you go soaring with me?” asked Jo-ey.\n\n“All right Joey you’re on!” shouted Livie as she began flapping her wings and lifted off sky-ward.\n\n“That’s great!” exclaimed Joey, as he began flapping his wings and lifted off from the nest. Jo-ey heard the song of the heart rushing through his mind as the world became smaller below. \n\nBy now the clouds boiling up above the bay were indicating strong thermals in a sky laden with moisture which was energizing the thermals. The clouds were growing larger, bubbling and bursting upward with great speed. \n\nJoey and his sister Livie lifted up on broad wings high above their tropical nest key until they were soaring on wide upwelling thermal currents. They flapped and soared in the direction of some brilliant white clouds.\n\nAs Livie and Joey flew through shadows cast down below the clouds they felt the rush of ther-mal currents that were feeding into the growing cumulus clouds. \n\nWith their wings fully outstretched now Livie and Joey spiraled higher and higher until their nest key was just a small but shining emerald among the many green keys sprinkled off the southern tip of the Everglades across Florida Bay. \n\nAs they continued to soar upward on strong thermal currents, Livie and Joey headed toward a developing cumulus cloud that was billowing out in front of some darker clouds. \n\nAs the two youngsters approached the cloud, Joey exclaimed: “Wow, look at the top of that cloud bursting upwards!”\n\n“I see it Joey,” replied Livie.\n\nThe warm air currents were rushing up beneath their wings as Livie and Joey entered gray mist at the base of the cloud. “Don’t stiffen up! Stay relaxed Joey!” shouted Livie. \n\nThey soared through misty vapor into the billowing and radiant cumulus cloud. \n\n“Sharpen your turn and stay within the up draft!” shouted Livie as the strong thermal pushed them upward. \n\nJoey felt the exhilaration of the warm air pushing up under his wing and body feathers. Then he was jolted by a strong gust which ruffled his long wing-tip primary feathers and thrust up the ends of the contour feathers along the leading edge of his wings. \n\n“This is awesome!” yelled Joey as the thermal current pushed them higher and higher inside the cloud. \n\nBy now Joey could see feelers of lightening branching off in all directions above them. \n\nThen Joey and Livie were buffeted by strong wind turbulence inside the great cloud which tossed them around. \n\nJoey felt muscles and tendons straining and saw feathers bending out along his wings as he tried to recover stable flight. \n\nThe shearing winds of a down draft slammed into Joey pushing him downward. \nThen strong gusts superimposed upon the down draft tossed Joey upside down. \n\n“I’m out of control!” thought Joey as fear clouded his mind. \n\nBrilliant light surrounded Joey as he was thrust out the side of the great cumulus cloud.\n\n“Wow that was the greatest experience of my life!” shouted Joey as he looked around. Joey could not see Livie as dark gray cloud now whizzed past his face. So Joey flew toward home on a long flat glide. \n\nJoey spotted Livie already back at their key. There sat Livie perched on a branch above their nest overlooking the grassy green meadow at the center of the key. Joey flew directly toward her and alighted onto the nest. \n\n“How did you get back here so fast Livie?” asked Joey. \n\n“I tumbled and turned every which way right out the side of the cloud!” exclaimed Livie. \n\n“That’s exactly what happened to me and I loved it!” exclaimed Joey. “I want to soar even higher into the greatest cloud next time!” \n\n“Oh Joey you don’t know the half of it,” remarked Livie. \n\n“What do you mean?” asked Joey.\n\n“The greatest cloud you speak of is the great storm!” exclaimed Livie. \n\n“So what?” asked Joey. \n\n“Mom said if you soar high into the storm there is great turbulence around the freezing level and you could collide with balls of ice that are tossing and churning up and down inside the cloud!” answered Livie. \n\n“That’s so cool!” exclaimed Joey. \n\n“It’s not funny,” replied Livie. “You must also watch out for strong shear currents created be-tween the downdraft and the thermal air flowing upward into the cloud. I’ve heard that the shearing winds between those up drafts and down drafts have torn birds apart!”\n\n“I still want to soar higher!” exclaimed Joey. “I want to soar to the top of the sky!” \n\n“I have heard that those up drafts and down drafts aren't even clearly defined as we just experi-enced for ourselves, Joey. There are strong gusts superimposed upon the up and down drafts which are rolling, tumbling and turning every which way,” remarked Livie. \n\n“Well, I had almost recovered to stable flight and was trying to stay within the up draft like you told me to do before I was tossed about and pushed out of the cloud by those crosswinds,” said Joey. \n\n“Stable flight is always a good feeling when we can do it. But most importantly Mom said we must learn to bend without breaking,” added Livie. \n\n“Okay then I will soar and bend right up to the top of the sky!” shouted Joey. \n\n“Look Joey here comes Mom and she’s clutching a big fish. Will she drop that fish\non the nest or will she dine in with us?” asked Livie as she began narrating Mom’s arrival.\n\n“And now Mom glides in, a magnificent specimen of a sea HAWK,” said Livie.\n\n“Mom hovers above the nest for a moment, then drops down to the nest with great wings raised up high, and with her head erect and legs wide apart she touches down for a perfect landing,” continued Livie with her narration. \n\n“Now Mom will prepare the meal of freshly caught seafood as her youngsters sit side by side with their necks craning forward and eyes watching intently as Mom carves the dinner.”\n\n“Oh cut it out Livie!” exclaimed Mom. “Now let's have dinner!”\n\nThen Mom passed tasty chunks of white meat to Livie and Joey from her bill to their bills and intermittently swallowed a piece of fish herself. \n\nAfter eating Mom flew over to a buttonwood tree and began grooming her feathers. \n\n“Now tell me Livie, have you tasted the mystical berries?” asked Joey. \n\n“What are mystical berries?” replied Livie. \n\n“They are berries that fall to the ground and accumulate in a sump under the mystic tree. I have often eaten those berries with my friends. The mystical berries make me feel happy and strong. Then my friends and I soared, whirled around and around and talon locked all afternoon having great fun!” exclaimed Joey.\n\n“Will you go with me to eat the mystical berries now?” asked Joey. \n\nLivie did not answer. Livie was busy preening her feathers as she nibbled along straightening and aligning each feather. \n\nJoey gazed out over the shimmering waters of Florida Bay and mused on the brightness of the day. Joey felt as one with all creatures swimming in the tides, moving on the land and flying in the skies.\n\nJoey felt the rhythms of all of nature flowing through his body and he heard the song of the heart pounding in his head. His mind warmed and flooded with white sunshine and his heart felt a fullness like it was filled with the brightness of joy and if the day would be any brighter, well his heart could just explode. \n\nJoey watched for the return of the EAGLES as the day turned into night and he fell asleep."

The young hawk yearned to soar as high as those magnificent birds, to touch the top of the sky and feel the rush of the wind beneath his wings.\n\nWith his sister Livie by his side, Joey took to the air, spiraling upward on the updrafts of a towering cumulus cloud. The wind buffeted them about, sending them tumbling through the gray mist, but Joey reveled in the thrill of the ride.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Joey settled back into the safety of the nest, content and full after a dinner of freshly caught seafood. He dreamed of the mystical berries and the joy they brought, but Livie was too busy preening her feathers to join him.\n\nJoey felt at one with the world, connected to all creatures great and small. As he drifted off to sleep, he listened for the call of the eagles, eager to join them again in the bright blue sky."

        "value": "The history of American universities visiting China to arrange student exchanges dates back to the 1970s when the two countries began to normalize their diplomatic relations. Prior to this time, the United States had no official relationship with China, and there were very few academic exchanges between the two countries.\n\nIn 1978, the United States and China signed a bilateral agreement that established formal educational exchanges between the two countries. This agreement paved the way for American universities to visit China to arrange student exchanges.\n\nOne of the earliest American universities to establish an exchange program with China was the University of Michigan. In 1979, the University of Michigan sent a delegation to China to explore the possibility of establishing an exchange program with Chinese universities. The delegation met with officials from several Chinese universities, and in 1981, the University of Michigan signed an agreement with Fudan University in Shanghai to establish an exchange program.\n\nOver the years, many American universities have followed the lead of the University of Michigan and established exchange programs with Chinese universities. Today, there are hundreds of such programs in place, with students from both countries regularly studying abroad in each other's universities.\n\nThese exchanges have had a significant impact on both countries. They have helped to promote mutual understanding between the United States and China, and they have provided opportunities for American and Chinese students to learn about each other's cultures and societies. They have also helped to foster academic collaboration and advance research in a variety of fields.\n\nHowever, in recent years, tensions between the United States and China have increased, and this has led to concerns about the future of academic exchanges between the two countries. Some American universities have faced pressure from the U.S. government to cut ties with Chinese universities, and some Chinese students have faced difficulties obtaining visas to study in the United States. Despite these challenges, many universities on both sides remain committed to continuing their exchange programs and fostering greater understanding between the two countries."

Today, I'll be sharing a delicious salad recipe with you that we have been making in different renditions for years now, and this version is the best yet. It has a few different components prepared in different ways, and this is the way to a good salad. If you want to learn more about the science behind how I compose salads, you can check out an article we made called \"Six Easy Steps to Level Up Your Salads\" that we posted last year. This salad has a base of crunchy veg that will be topped with delicious sticky ginger tofu, nuts, coriander, and spring onion.\n\nQuick Pickled Chilies:\n\nTo make quick pickled chilies, you will need two nondescript long green chilies, or jalapenos if you can't find this variety. Slice the peppers up and transfer them into a jar. In a small saucepan, add one quarter cup of water, one quarter cup of rice vinegar, one quarter of a teaspoon of sugar, and one quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Warm it up over low-medium heat and whisk it until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the liquid over the peppers in the jar and coat them all in the liquid. Let them sit while you prep the rest of the recipe.\n\nGinger Tofu:\n\nThe marinade or glaze for the tofu is very similar to the dressing that goes for the crunchy veg in the base of the salad. I like to prepare them at the same time. Pat dry 400g extra-firm tofu with a clean towel. If you are using plain firm tofu, press it for about half an hour to get rid of any excess liquid. Once it's dry, cut it into small cubes and place it in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together three tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons of maple syrup, two tablespoons of rice vinegar, two tablespoons of grated ginger, and two grated garlic cloves. Pour the marinade over the tofu and let it sit for a few minutes.\n\nCrunchy Veg Base:\n\nThe crunchy veg base consists of two grated carrots, half a head of thinly sliced red cabbage, one thinly sliced red onion, one grated apple, and a handful of finely sliced snow peas. Mix all the vegetables together in a large bowl.\n\nSalad Dressing:\n\nTo make the dressing, mix together two tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of soy sauce, one tablespoon of maple syrup, one tablespoon of rice vinegar, two grated garlic cloves, and one grated thumb-sized piece of ginger.\n\nAssembly:\n\nAdd the marinated tofu on top of the crunchy veg base, and sprinkle some chopped nuts, coriander, and spring onion on top. Finally, add the quick pickled chilies on top of the salad. Pour the dressing over the salad and enjoy!"

The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"emotional intelligence\". Read \"From good to great\". Read “thinking fast and slow”. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat’s about it man. There’s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that’s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey… I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can’t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome fucking day ☺\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you’s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\nEdit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\nEdit2: Someone asked what I meant by \"much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days\". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It's this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought's son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\nOk, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go."

ROXIE (16, insightful, insecure, bald) is a typical teenage girl, except…she has Alopecia. Completely hairless, Roxie wears a wig, leaving most her peers unaware of her condition. Life hasn’t been so easy since she lost her hair. Her father ADAM (50) left the family to move to Montauk, leaving DEBRA (40’s, marketing exec, fitness obsessed, anorexic) an emotional wreck. Fortunately, Roxie’s supported by her bestie LIZZIE (16, lesbian). Roxie crushes on MIKE (17, hot) in her gym class but’s terrified he’ll think she’s a freak. It’s near the end of the school year, summer’s arrived. Roxie’s grandmother, LENORE (77, regal) calls Debra from Florida with unfortunate news; Larry, Debra’s father and Lenore’s husband of fifty years, has passed away. She’ll be flying home with the body tomorrow for a weekend funeral.\n\nLenore arrives and makes funeral arrangements. She loves Roxie dearly, and pulls a softer side of the girl out from beneath her bratty teenage veneer. Roxie’s beautiful when she has her wig off, stunning even. Roxie can’t imagine ever showing the world her baldness. Debra’s devastated to lose her father. Lenore was once a famous soap opera actress, leaving Larry to do most of the parenting when Debra was a child. Adam attends the funeral awkwardly but Lenore’s glad he came. He tells Roxie he’s started seriously dating someone up in Montauk, infuriating Debra. That night, Roxie goes to a beach party with Lenore and gets high with the popular kids including Mike, and Lizzie's secret girlfriend ALLISON (17). Everyone’s flirty and fun but when Mike suggests they all go swimming, Roxie freaks and makes Lizzie take her home. (She can’t get her wig wet)\n\nDebra’s work has suffered since her separation. Her boss chews her out for laziness, tardiness, pushing Debra to work harder to improve herself. Debra tries myriad fitness activities throughout the film, and is almost always working out or planning a new diet. At her gym, she meets JEFF (50’s, fit, kind) and oh do the sparks fly. Jeff works at a local Beach Club and offers to give Roxie a job for the summer. He’d also give the family free access to the club. He really likes Debra. Roxie’s not thrilled at first to have to work, but soon realizes Mike and his friends visit the Beach Club every day, giving her ample opportunity to woo from her post at the concession stand. She gives him free snacks, she plays his favorite band on the speakers, etc. Meanwhile, Lenore sticks around, afraid to move back to Florida and live alone. On errands about town, she’s recognized by fans of her old tv show. Everyone mentions how unfair it was when they killed her character, but we don’t know why. She takes Roxie to lunch one weekend at a local diner. Mike, Allison and their friend TARA (16) enter the diner and Mike’s nice enough to come over and say hello/introduce himself to Lenore. Afterwards, we hear Tara gossiping with Mike. She tells him Roxie has alopecia/no hair!\n\nAt the beach club soon after, on a rainy day, Mike comes over to the concession stand to shelter from the storm. He’s really flirty with Roxie, their arms touch, but when he reaches out to feel her hair, Roxie freaks and backs away. He asks point blank if she wears a wig, Roxie lies and says no. Mike backs off, Roxie’s mortified. -- Debra gets closer with Jeff, but has a temper tantrum when Adam calls her to say he’d like Roxie to meet his new girlfriend. Debra seethes. She reads about a popular meditation practice and drives up to Montauk to take a class. LAURA (40’s, hippy) leads the class. Forgive yourself. Forgive your transgressors etc. Unfortunately, Laura is Adam’s new girlfriend. She realizes this outside the studio right after her first lesson. Debra too is mortified, she flees home. \n\nThe three women get into a fight with each other back home, each projecting their frustrations onto the other. Debra blames Adam for her problems, for leaving her alone to raise Roxie, and hates that Roxie wants anything to do with him. Roxie blames Debra for never asking how she’s doing/handling her hair loss. They each say things they’ll regret and when Lenore tries to step in and stop the fighting, they flip out and start shoving each other/screaming. In the chaos, Roxie’s wig gets knocked into a pile of spilled milk! Lenore goes to console Roxie, the two then go to the beach but Roxie doesn’t take her wig! Once there, Roxie’s nerves spike, but Lenore assures her she looks fantastic; they tan and talk. Lenore reveals that when Roxie was a baby, Lenore was diagnosed with breast cancer, and lost all her hair from chemo before finally having one breast removed. She wears a prosthetic to hide the missing breast. Roxie had no idea. To Roxie’s surprise, Lizzie, Allison, Mike, and Tara pass them at the beach. They’re shocked to find Roxie bald, but Roxie’s devastated to see Mike holding hands with Tara! Lizzie knew they were dating and lied about it! Lenore takes Roxie home.\n\nRoxie ignores Lizzie’s calls, and tries to sleep. Lenore and Debra have a heart to heart about their own issues. Lenore wants to be there for Debra. The next morning, Debra apologizes to the family for freaking out the night before, she’s trying to work on her anger. -- Mike approaches Roxie at the concession stand a few days later and tells Roxie it’s super cool she stopped wearing the wig, he thinks she looks great. Roxie’s finally feeling confident.\n\nThat weekend, Roxie goes to dinner, bald, with Adam and Laura. Laura turns out to be perfectly lovely; she compliments Roxie’s beauty. Lizzie surprises Roxie in the bathroom at dinner and apologizes for lying. Allison’s been coming out as bi and things were just really stressful etc. Roxie forgives her. Meanwhile, Jeff asks Debra on a proper date and the two go to dinner, they kiss! Debra’s boss also calls to tell her she’s been doing great work. Lenore spends her evening in a grief counseling group. She finally expresses her sadness and fear of loneliness out loud. When Roxie gets home, she finds her wig and throws it away.\n\nThe next morning, the three women wake up refreshed, anew. They drive to a secret secluded beach where they can tan alone. Lenore takes off her prosthetic, Roxie’s bald, and Debra confident for once. Each alive in their own skin. They drive home singing. The end."

The characters are well-defined and relatable, with distinct personalities and motivations.

The `scan` stage uses the `docker:latest` image to install and run ClamAV antivirus software, and downloads the new binary artifact from the Nexus3 repository using the `$NEXUS_REPO` environment variable. If the scan is successful, the pipeline will proceed to the `approve` stage.\n\nThe `approve` stage requires manual intervention, which means that two people from the pipeline group must approve the binary before it can be deployed. This stage is only triggered when a merge request is merged into the `master` branch. When the binary has passed the antivirus scan, the pipeline will print a message indicating that it is safe to approve the deployment.\n\nNote that you will need to customize this .gitlab-ci.yml file to fit your specific needs. You will need to replace the `$NEXUS_REPO` variable with the URL of your Nexus3 repository, and you may need to adjust the `apk add` and `freshclam` commands to install and update ClamAV correctly for your environment. Additionally, you may need to adjust the `curl` command to download the new binary artifact correctly, depending on your Nexus3 configuration."

In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement. \n\nAn example of the state is:\nRod A: [3,2,1]\n\nThis means that Rod A has disk 3 on the bottom and disk 1 on the top.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the disk on the top of a rod off and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nStart by listing out all valid moves at the current state.\n\nAction Items:\n- Repeat all the rules.\n- List out all valid moves.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 1 = = =\n- Rule Checking:\n - Rule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n - Rule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n - Rule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n- Valid Moves:\n - Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n - Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n - Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C\n\nStage 2: Select.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only select one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. Check if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nAction Items:\n- Choose a move.\n- Print the representation.\n- Check the representation\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]\n```\n\nStage 3: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make some evaluations.\n\nAction Items:\n- Repeat the goal condition.\n- Eval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n- Eval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it’s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n- Eval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n- Eval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 = = =\n- Goal Checking:\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but clearly not optimal.\n\nStage 4: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nAction Item:\n- Decide if to take the move\n - If so, proceed to Stage 5.\n - Else, go back to Stage 2 and choose another move.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- Go back to Stage 2.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Value: 1.

Once you have this value, you can add it to the mean of the dataset to find the upper bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean. Similarly, you can subtract this value from the mean to find the lower bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean. Here are the steps to do this:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the dataset.\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of the dataset.\n3. Multiply the standard deviation by 2.\n4. Add the product obtained in step 3 to the mean to find the upper bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean.\n5. Subtract the product obtained in step 3 from the mean to find the lower bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a dataset of exam scores with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. To add two standard deviations within this dataset, you would:\n\n1. Mean = 80\n2. Standard deviation = 10\n3. 2 \\* standard deviation = 20\n4. Upper bound = 80 + 20 = 100\n5. Lower bound = 80 - 20 = 60\n\nTherefore, the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean is 60 to 100."

In this case, we have three expressions and three output variables: `HRD_CALC1`, `HRD_CALC2`, and `HRD_CALC3`.\n2. Draw a directed edge from an expression to the output variable it calculates. For example, there should be an edge from `HRD_01 + HRD_02` to `HRD_CALC1`.\n3. If an expression depends on the output of another expression, draw a directed edge from the dependent expression to the expression it depends on. For example, there should be an edge from `HRD_CALC1 * HRD_02 * (1000/60)` to `HRD_CALC2`.\n4. The resulting graph should have nodes for all output variables and expressions and edges between the nodes representing the dependencies between them.\n\nHere is the directed graph for the given JSON:\n```lua\nHRD_01 ----+\n           |\nHRD_02 ----+---> HRD_CALC1 ----+\n                                |\n                                +---> HRD_CALC2 ----+\n                                                     |\n                                                     +---> HRD_CALC3\n                                +---> HRD_02 ---------+\n           |\n           +---> HRD_02\n```\nIn the above graph, the nodes `HRD_01` and `HRD_02` have no incoming edges, as they are not calculated from any other expressions.

Current stimulation methods, such as Deep Brain Stimulation or Vagus Nerve Stimulation, are highly invasive and require subsequent surgery to replace the batteries. Additionally, the stimulation of neurons through optical or electrical methods is complex due to the signal’s attenuation as it passes through tissue and bone. Magnetic fields could potentially stimulate neurons without signal attenuation and the capability to penetrate the body deeply. The depth of magnetic stimulation is based on the distance from the source of stimulation. Unlike ultrasound or electromagnetic radiation, magnetic field lines are unhindered by tissue due to the low amount of magnetic forces in blood[1]. Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows that it could be an effective stimulating agent. The size of the electromagnetic coils needed for transcranial magnetic stimulation limits its potential as a neural interface. Ideally, the neural interface would be able to be used in the daily life of patients with minimal interference. Therefore, large electromagnetic coils are impractical as neural interfaces due to their size and immobility. \nMagnetoelectric nanoparticles(MENs) could alleviate the issue by allowing lower-intensity magnetic fields to stimulate neurons electrically. Due to their nanoscale size, MENs could be anchored directly to the targeted neurons’ ion channels. Therefore, as the magnetic field(primary signal) reaches the MENs, they will transduce the magnetic field into local electricity(secondary signal), which would be focused onto the ion channel, potentially causing it to activate. Using this principle, a lower magnetic field aided by MENs could have a similar effect on neurons as a higher electric field. 30 nm CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 magnetoelectric core-shell nanoparticles have been used to prove this by affecting EEG waveforms with a weak magnetic field of 10mT at 20 Hz[2]. The previously stated MENs utilize the nonzero magnetoelectric effect[3] caused by the coupling of electric and magnetic fields in the MENs. In the study, under a 10mT magnetic field, the MENs could produce an electric field of 100V/M. The resulting electric field would be released within nanometers of the ion channels. It can be seen that the magnetic field needed to stimulate neurons with MENs could be drastically reduced as the transduced signal is highly focused on targeting the ion channels. In this study, C. elegans will be used as a model organism to test the effect of MENs on neuron behavior. Voltage-gated calcium channels will be targeted for MENs binding because if the channels are activated, the excitability of the neurons will increase. \nMethods\n The preparation of CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 will be synthesized according to the published procedures, which consist of a two-step wet chemical procedure as depicted in figure 1[4.]. \nFigure 1: A depiction of the fabrication of CoFe 2O4-BaTiO3. CoFe2O4 (sample CFO) was synthesized by chemical co-precipitation, ferrofluid was prepared, then core-shell nanostructures of CoFe2O4–BaTiO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel technique [4.]\n \nA cobalt ferrite core should be surrounded by a barium titanate shell-like coating [4.]. The MENs will need to be coated to ensure the neural interface’s stability in a biological system. \nFor the MENs to attach to C. Elegans neuronal plasma membranes, the MENs and plasma membrane will need to be modified to allow for binding. To ensure the MENs can bind to the plasma membrane, the MENs will be surface coated with streptavidin using succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC, Pierce) as cross-linker as shown in [5]. With streptavadin attached to the surface of the MENs, it will allow the connection of MENs to streptavidin to biotin, as shown in figure 2. \nFigure 2: The above figure depicts the linking of MENs to the neuron's plasma membrane. The AP-CFP-TM protein complex is used as an anchor protein with the biotinylated AP region binding to the streptavidin, which is surface coated onto the MEN[5]. \nIn order to stimulate and observe the animals in this experiment, the genetic modification of C. elegans will be required. C. elegans expressing GCAMP6 will be acquired, such as CX17256kyIs722 [str-2p::GCaMP5(D380Y) + elt-2::mCherry], a strain of C. elegans which expresses GCaMP5a[6]. GCAMP is a genetically encoded calcium indicator that will allow for the imaging of neuronal activity via fluorescent imaging[7]. Once obtained, the C. elegans would need to be modified to have their plasma membranes bound to the MENs. In order to achieve this, microinjection will be utilized to have the AP-CFP-TM plasmid transfected into the C.elegans. Microinjection is a method for creating transgenic animals that requires injecting DNA into the distal arm of the gonad[8]. Due to the fact the distal arm of the gonad houses the central core of the germ cytoplasm, the injected DNA will spread efficiently to the offspring[8]. By inserting the AP-CFP-TM plasmid, the offspring will express the protein in their nuclear plasma membranes. The membrane marker protein AP-CFP-TM comprises a transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor, fluorescent protein, and a biotin acceptor protein. The biotin acceptor protein is enzymatically biotinylated, which forms binding sites for the conjugated MENs allowing for stimulation of the C. elegans[5].\n \nTo stimulate C. elegans, a method of creating an electromagnetic field without hindering the microscope is necessary. An electromagnet capable of at least 0.1T is needed to do this. Figure 3 depicts the electromagnet chosen for the design as it satisfies the project's needs.\n \nFigure 3: The 5203 electromagnet by GMWAssociates can vertically provide a projected magnetic field from its faceplate. It weighs 2.5kg and can achieve 0.5T up to 5mm away from the faceplate. \n To prepare the C. elegans for the experiments, the functionalized streptavidin-coated MENs will be microinjected into AP-CFP-TM expressing C. elegans. With the MENs injected into the head region of the C. elegans, the MENs should begin to bind to the AP-CFP-TM proteins anchored to the plasma membrane. Once this process is completed, the experiment may proceed. \nFigure 4: The above figure depicts the experimental setup. Two electromagnets would be positioned on the sides of a dual arena microfluidic device. The device would be capable of holding two groups of C. elegans.\nEach experiment will consist of twenty trials with two groups of C. elegans. Group one will consist of the MENs-modified C. elegans, and Group 2 will be the control. In each trial, both groups will be placed in a microfluidics device subjected to a 100Hz magnetic field starting from the minimum to the maximum magnetic field in increments of 1 mT. Each trial will last for 120 seconds. The first 30 seconds will observe baseline neural activity, and the next 90 seconds to observe stimulated neural activity. \nTo image the neuronal activity, fluorescent imaging will be used. A Zeiss AxioObserver.A1 with an inverted body with Zeiss Fluar objective lenses will be used[6]. The timing of the camera and the electromagnets would be handled through a program named micromanager. The results will be recorded and analyzed using neurotracker, and the intensity of the neural activity will be compared for the control and the modified C. elegans.\"2 / 2"

At every step, gnarled roots violated the path serving only to trip, and serrated leaves obscured the way. When the leaves finally cleared up, the corpse of an Alpu was seen sinking into a murky swamp. A dark cloud of insects devoured the viscera that spewed from the belly of the four-legged animal. The flesh on its head had already been completely consumed, leaving nothing but a pallid skull with three antlers protruding from it. Notably, the right antler seems to have been snapped in two. A sweet, rancid smell infiltrated the nostrils that worsened with every inhalation. It sang a song of inevitability and mortality. \nNex had seen when the Alpu, laying on its side, had bleated in agony after breaking its leg. It had probably stumbled whilst running away from a predator or slipped on one of the many large smooth stones in the area. No matter the cause, the result was the same. It was going to die a slow, painful death. He made his way cautiously to the large creature. The wild eyes and flaring nostrils of the animal were warning enough of the potential harm it may be able to cause to him if he didn’t proceed with care. As he approached, it caught his scent and attempted to stand but failed. It cried out desperately flailing its functional legs and bucking its head. Despite its cries, none of its herd came to help as was typical of Alpu. This fact caused Nex to frown because he realized it was just like him. He too had been left abandoned by those closest to him and broken. \nHe shook his head and stared at the Alpu. He brought his finger to the air and slowly drew a pale, crimson line over its head. In an instant, its legs stopped failing as its head crumpled to the earth. It was on his second trip he had this encounter, and Nex made sure to visit this sight on every trip afterward as a sign of respect.\n After trudging the path for hours, his hair was shaggy and peppered with leaves. His dark gray tunic was riddled with holes and mud-covered his calf-length leather boots. The once white undershirt now splotchy and brown. Lacerations shown on his fair skin, some from trips before this one. The steepness of the hill had made every fibre in his legs ache, and the sweat soaking into his wounds made them sizzle and burn. His young face sulky as his teeth grit with every movement. Under his breath, he ritualistically rehearsed what he would say once he arrived at the cabin, his voice trembling under the weight of his own words. The more he practiced, the more he thought of all the other times he had not managed the courage to say the words which made him want to practice more. It was a vicious cycle. \nThe path he walked was well-tread despite the overgrowth that surrounded it. While, admittedly, most of the footsteps had been his own, there were older tracks that told of the others that had made this journey. In his first trips, he had learned any attempt to cut the thick vines surrounding him was always met with the plants growing fiercely like cutting the head from a hydra. Using a long knife, he had to be careful not to cut or damage any of them as he had done on his first attempt, where he was almost consumed. Carefully, he used his knife as a needle and himself the thread carefully pulling himself through. \nThe sound of a rushing river roared ahead. Nex paused as he came to the familiar source. A steep ravine lay before him with white water rapids rushing over the smooth river rocks. He reached into the satchel and withdrew a small, flat multi-colored pebble with an insignia engraved on both of its sides. Slowly, he pressed the pebble onto his lips speaking a soft incantation then dropped the pebble into the ravine. It flickered and twirled in the light as it fell. \nEventually, it disappeared into the surging current. He grunted and opened a yellow hide journal. As he did, sigils began to glow brightly from the page, and colorful displays of words and figures sprang from the book, surrounding him. Wasting no time, his eyes danced across the page, checking the wind speeds, the depth of the ravine, and even the composition of the water. Then, he made a satisfied sigh and closed the book, which made the displays fade into oblivion. With both hands, he began drawing intricate runes in the air, each glowing its own vibrant color, each sparking with energy. Then with one swift motion, he encompassed the runes with a circle and commanded Astarzia. \n\""

Try to extract my personality from the writing and tell me who you think I am:\n\nThe roaring of the river slowed to a soft bubbling. He raised his arms from his hips slowly above his head. In obedience, the river followed his lead, slowly rising out of the ravine until it was level with the gap. The water seemed to be like a carefully crafted pane of glass. There was not a single ripple on its surface. Any sediment carried by the river had been left on the dry earth below it. However, fish could still be seen casually swimming in the pristine water. \nWithout hesitation, Nex stepped onto the water bridge. He walked with cool confidence more focused on the words he was to say rather than the sheer drop below him. However, his foot never sank below the surface, nor did it even get wet. After a minute of walking, he finally reached the other side. He paused, furling his brows, then turned around. Nex recalled his first time traversing the ravine taking him a week of work, but after countless times of repeating the test, it was a breeze for him. After using his hands to lower the water back to its rightful place, he commanded it to resume.\n Nex’s stomach lurched as the path began to become more defined, and at the end of it, a small cabin came into sight. His skin would always go pale every time he saw it. It was an austere wood cabin with two chimneys protruding from the sides of it. Two medium-sized windows were covered by lush purple curtains with golden embroidering. An extensive garden surrounded the cabin growing medicinal herbs, fruits, and vegetables. As Nex continued on, his heart raced through his chest, and his lungs began to protest. His once somewhat coherent mantra hastened into an unintelligible cacophony as he realized he could no longer stall. He paused in front of the door, trembling. There was no way he could move, let alone speak. His face sunk deeper into itself as his breathing quickened, but no matter how hard he called for air, it felt like none came to him. He willed himself into raising his shaking hand to knock. All it would take was one small knock, yet his clenched fist hovered over the door. Hesitation.\nHe took a step back. Then another. He began to turn around to return back to his home. As he turned around to leave, he found himself suddenly rushing through the air. It felt as if a wild beast had just decided his insides needed to be smeared across the walls of the cabin and smashed into him. He let out a sharp yelp and scrambled to see who or what just pushed him to no avail. \nSlowly, the wooden door slowly creaked open on its own. To his surprise, the inside of the small cabin was much bigger on the inside with doors that seemingly led to rooms that couldn’t exist. He had heard tales of buildings like these, but to see one in person with its rugs that sported moving, intricate patterns, each perfectly in sync with the next. Its walls were littered with apparatuses that all connected together. A large stack of books, manuscripts, and scrolls lay perfectly stacked in piles on the floor next to an ornate ebony desk. Nex’s eyes sparkled as they darted over everything before him.\nFinally, his eyes rested on a wizened person that was looking at him warmly from a dark majoan desk with countless shifting runes inscribed on it. “It took you long enough. ” Their voice was androgenous and kind. Nex stood dumbstruck. He looked back at the door that he apparently had just crashed through. His face contorted as a wave of realization washed over him. He was inside of Jayen Wen’s house. Jayen Wen spoke again, “You seem like you’ve been through quite a rough time. I do hope the tests weren’t too difficult.”\nNex, realizing he hadn’t said anything, finally started to blurt out his carefully rehearsed introduction, but it was, at best, unintelligible. Jayen motioned to a seat that began moving in front of the desk, “ Do try to calm yourself, yes?” Nex obediently scurried over to the seat and sat down. Jayen’s eyes inspected Nex.\n“You stated your name as Nex, yes? What of your surname then?”\nNex slowly lowered his gaze to the desk and slightly slumped into the chair, “ None.” \nJayen’s eyebrows raised, then furled, “Hmmm. A Kusin then? Alright, What of your father’s at least?”\nNex’s gaze and posture sank even further, “He is a kusin as well.”\nJayen taps their finger rhythmically on the arm of the chair, “I see.” Their eyes began probing Nex as he sat slumped, analyzing every inch of him. \n“Well this just won’t do,” Jayen said as they started making precise movements with their hands. Nex had studied magic all of his life. From alchemy, arcanology, and spirit magic, he had a detailed understanding of all of the gestures that could be used in each field, yet these gestures baffled him. They were unnatural and unlike anything he’s ever seen. There weren’t arcane symbols or runes, there weren’t chemical arrays or displays, yet when it was completed, he felt a warm, bubbling feeling wash over him emanating from within him. Nex could feel the torn muscle fibre within him being knit back together, and the skin around his wounds tighten as they are repaired and made taut. \n” I’ve never seen magic that heals like this before, “ he paused thoughtfully, “not without a cost.” \nJayen shook their head,” There’s always a cost, dear boy. Just a matter of the currency used. Now, what is the reason you’ve come to see me?” Nex’s face soured with those words, but he quickly glanced around at the different apparatuses and the horde of books, and his gaze became steely.\nNex cleared his throat, “Master Jayen Wen if it pleases you, would you take me as your apprentice?” \nJayen smiled warmly, “I’ve been watching you come to my door for the last two moons and turning away once you got here. Truth be told, I always teach anyone that could make it to my door,” Jayen eyed him curiously, “but you not only made it here once, but forty-six times. I simply couldn’t stand for it to be a forty-seventh, so I gave you a little push in the right direction.” Jayen’s smile turned mischievous with that last bit, and Nex’s face turned an embarrassing red as he both profusely apologized and thanked them. Then, a quizzical look sprouted on his face, “But, I’m a kusin. Lyfe, I’m a kusin of a kusin. I assumed someone of your worth wouldn’t want to train someone as low as I.”\nFor a second, a flicker of disgust flashed on Jayen’s face before their usual composed face took hold, “What of it? I am not so vain as to deprive a rose of water because it might blossom.” Jayen paused, rubbing their chin contemplatively, “However, there is one final test. For a kusin such as yourself. Arguably the hardest, mind you, but if you can pass this one. You will be worthy of being my apprentice.”\nNex perked up, “Anything.”\nJayen sighed, “Then, let us begin. Follow me.”\n The pair weaved through the massive library’s rows and columns until they reached a long corridor filled with doors adorned with various portraits. Each portrait seemed to be an intricate landscape of different locations. If he squinted, he could even see what could be tiny beings in the pictures bustling about their days. Most of the places he had seen in books, others he had visited while performing his studies, and few he hadn’t even imagined. However, Jayen paused on a door without a portrait. \n“This test will not be like any other so far. Your objective is to return here,” Jayen said. Jayen’s cheerful face had grown grim, “You’re sure you want to be my apprentice, kusin?” Nex nodded his head without hesitation. Jayen sighed again, then quickly opened the door and pushed Nex in. \nThen, survive.\n The frameless door stood solitary around a weave of shrubs and brush until it slowly faded into nothingness. Around him, a sea of vibrant amber stalks stretched out endlessly to the horizon. Individually, the stalks stood translucent, radiating a soft glow, but as a collective, the stalks melded together, forming rolling waves of gleaming radiance in the night atmosphere. As Nex looked into the sky, he saw it was a uniform black haze, not a single cloud floated in the sky, nor did a single star dot it, yet no matter where he looked, every surface was illuminated by some unknown source from up above. Nex quickly reached for his satchel and produced his journal. As he opened it, no sigils or words sprang forth. He opened the book to the runes he had written to animate the journal in dull black ink. Nex frowned. \nHe produced a pebble from his satchel. The measurestone was supposed to be multicolored and vibrant, but it, instead, was yellowish, gray. Nex frantically emptied his satchel and rifled through all of his journals, arcane stones, and magics. His breathing grew labored as he shouted and gestured manically attempting to produce any sort of magic, but his efforts were in vain. He quickly rose and attempted to draw runes in the air. However, where he expected bright streaks to follow his fingers, he saw nothing at all. After shaking his head, he perked up and picked up a black leatherbound journal dusted with stark white dots labeled Star Map. He fingered through page after page of atlases and astronomical maps. However, without stars in the sky to act as his guide nor landmarks in the uniform sea of light, his search proved fruitless. \nUnder the unchanging sky, time was just a construct. Nex had no idea how long he had walked. Hours could have been days for all he knew. At first, he looked out at the field and admired its beauty, taking the time to sketch it to the best of his ability. He had to stop after running out of paper in his empty journals. As time moved on, he tried seeing figures in the waves to entertain himself. Once, he was able to see mighty grochas riding the waves as he had seen once in Drago. The massive beasts easily glided over the stalks before sinking below the surface again, causing surging surfs of dimming lights in their wake. If he were, to be honest with himself, he might have embellished the mental image, but it was more fun than reality. As he looked out, he noticed a wave heading towards him. This wave was smaller than the rest that occasionally passed by. Usually, when they came, the preceding stalk would slightly dim then return to normal luminosity. However, the lightstalks in the wake of this wave did not shine. They laid dim and lifeless, leaving a dark scar in the field marking where this wave had traveled. After a closer look, Nex noticed the lightstalks before the wave would burst with a blinding light before being snuffed out by the….what was that.\n With the wall of light before the creature, Nex couldn’t quite see its features, but it was large and pale like freshly cleaned teeth. Despite its size, it moved swiftly. He noticed it wasn’t quite going toward him. It was heading in the direction he had come from. Nex squinted at it, but the bright light caused him to wince and rub his eyes. He tried drawing a sigil that would allow him to see it better then chided himself once it failed to work. It stopped. The wall of light subsided as it raised its head in Nex’s direction. His mouth went dry. The creature stood on four sturdy legs that were covered in a pale yellow fur that resembled the lightstalks surrounding it. Its head had large metallic horns protruding from it where its eyes should be, and its large mouth was a serrated tunnel of gyrating metal teeth. It stood on its hindlegs allowing Nex to see the plated scales on its belly. It sniffed the air. As it did, its entire body pulsated with light in rhythm with its nostrils flaring. Nex began to slowly back away, but his hand slightly brushed a stalk, which caused it to dim slightly. The creature’s fur bristled. Nex felt a weight in his belly, and his blood chilled as its head sharply turned towards him. It let out a ghastly howl before charging towards him. Nex cursed under his breath and began to sprint. \nAs he ran, lightstalks brushed against him, causing them to dim. Nex glanced over his shoulder to see the hulking frame of the beast encroaching on him. He pumped his legs as fast as they would take him and looked around for anywhere to hide. Despite his running, he noticed that he didn’t feel tired. He made a mental note of that while racking his brain on how to survive. It had to be a part of the test. Nex didn’t have to hear the pounding of the creature’s paws against the ground and the jagged vortex that was its mouth as it sucked the light out of the stalks near in front of it, but he looked anyway. It really didn’t have eyes. He saw as it maneuvered its horns side to side as if tracking him through scent. It let out another blaring roar that left Nex’s ears ringing. The sinking feeling in his stomach worsened. His heart pumped in his throat. He felt the suction of the animal start to tug at his body. As it did, he began to feel lethargic. He tried moving his arms and legs, but they refused to listen. The cacophony of the creature's mouth with its spinning metal teeth played his requiem. He felt as the energy started to burn as the air around him fiercely pulled at him, beckoning him to stop. Stars appeared in his vision. Nex knew if he didn’t do something, he would die. A meal for a creature he had never seen anywhere in any of the bestiaries he’s studied. Summoning the last ounce of his strength, Nex leaped to the side, dodging the creature. \nHe rolled then finally lay slumped, barely able to get himself to a kneeling position. It continued on its path before standing on its hindlegs slowly swiveling its head as it had done before. He watched as the animal turned its head leading with its horns as if trying to find his position. Nex carefully picked up a small stone. As he did, a sharp pain shot up his arm. He had to will himself not to cry out lest the beast find out where he is. Tears formed at the edges of his eyes as he steeled himself and chucked the stone. As it landed, a few lightstalks sparked then wilted as the stone hit them. The creature snapped its head in that direction and began chasing after the stone. Nex didn’t move a muscle until he saw the blackened path left by the creature go over a distant hill. Once the beast was gone, Nex doubled over and vomited. The pain he felt across his body subsided to a dull ache until it evaporated entirely. Nex looked in the direction the beast had gone and walked in the opposite direction.\n He had heard the wails of the beast several times in the course of him walking. Whenever he did, he would avoid any and all movement to avoid it seeing him. Being alert constantly had tired Nex’s mind, yet he didn’t feel the need to sleep. Even though he had sprinted for way too long, he never felt exhaustion as if he could run forever. He had also noticed that he hadn’t felt even a twinge of hunger or thirst the entire time he had been in this place. \nHe thought back to his mother’s cooking before she had left him.His favorite was always the sweet meat pie she would make on special occasions. He slowly fell back onto the ground, tucked his knees to his chin, buried his face in them, and began to cry. He cried until his eyes were raw from him wiping his tears. He beat his fist into the spongy earth until his knuckles were bloodied. He thought back to the Alpu, and how it had fought to the bitter end to survive. Slowly, he came to his feet, retrieved his yellow journal from his satchel, and began to take note of everything he has learned of the place he is in."

Thank you so much for your help!:\n\nAs he walked, he took note of every little discrepancy. Until, a pattern emerged. The earth was relatively uniform, but he noticed similar small smooth rocks to the one he had thrown to distract the beast. The stalks near these stones were always wilted. Nex used a thin pair of tongs to pick on up and place it into his hand. When it made contact with his hand, he felt a wave of tiredness wash over him. Then, a white, searing pain riggled through his arm into his heart causing him to double over in agony. The pain caused him to clench his fist over the stone which caused more snakes of pain to slither up his arm. He dropped the stone as quickly as possible. Nex tried to straighten himself, but he grew dizzy stepping twice with his right foot and thrice with his left. He saw the bright field of light intensify as his vision blurred, and the world tumbled as he collapsed. \nNex slowly rose, rubbing the back of his head that now had a knot the size of his fist on it. He groggily glanced at the stone in disgust, then in curiosity. He began collecting nearby lightstalks. They proved to be relatively sturdy despite their wiry appearance. Given enough working, they were able to be braided into thin wires, and those wires into thick chains. Diligently, Nex worked for hours weaving and interweaving stalks together. When he was done, he stood up to admire his handiwork. A woven table that gave off a welcoming glow. Then, Nex watched it slowly lean and tear itself apparent under its open weight. His face sank and he kicked at the nearby stalks. After a while, he finally began again. \nHe opened up his alchemy kit and used the tongs to carefully place stones onto his small but stable table. After many interactions, he had finally found a design that didn’t instantly collapse. The left side of the table he had designated to alchemical studies of the stones while the right was for arcane studies. Admittedly, he had trouble with arcane studies because magic seemed not to function in this place. However, alchemy was not magic, and he spent what felt like days learning of the different alchemical properties of the stones. Whenever he would feel discouraged, he would quickly touch one of the stones and immediately recoil in pain. If the property that caused that pain in him was caused by this stone, then maybe it wasn’t magical in nature. \nNex stroked his, now stubbly chin. Time did not change in this place, yet he seemed to grow a beard. He had no idea how long he had been here. For all he knew, Jayen had exiled him here for the crime of even talking to them as a kusin. He stopped stroking and returned to his work. \nAfter countless experiments with the stones, he had noticed an interesting property. When the stalks were in direct contact with the stones, they would completely lose their light. The size of the stone didn’t matter either, the only thing that mattered was how much of the stone was touching. He grabbed his satchel and grabbed his yellow journal. He took it over towards the table and opened it with a stone on top, placing a stone on top The stone began ever so slightly glowing a dim black light and moved ever so slightly. He almost mistook the light for a shadow at first. He tried drawing a rune in the air, and the stone glowed the same black light ever so slightly more intense. \nNex continued with his experiments allowing different spells and rituals to be absorbed by the small stone. Until, he came to the conclusion that the stones were tiny transmitters that drew upon the ambient magic. Nex carefully used his trusty tongs to fasten a stone into a thin stalk he had made into a makeshift string and let it dangle from his finger. He said the incantation to a spell and watched as the stone slightly moved to his left. He nodded approvingly and looked back on his makeshift workshop, stroking his now fully grown, unkempt beard. He gave the table a loving pat after packing up all of his equipment. Then, with compass in hand, he followed the stone. \nHis blood curdled when he heard the roar in the distance and saw a tiny figure running towards him from just over the horizon. Without hesitation, Nex began running. If his theory was correct, these stones were the means of his escape. If they really absorbed magic as he expected, they could be used to hone in on Jayen’s magic. As he ran, Nex noticed that the waves began to grow more rhythmic in nature. Before, they were beautiful and chaotic going every which way and colliding with each other. He glanced behind him to see the creature tearing through the waves. Nex’s face sank as he saw the color of its horns in the distance. They were the same as the stones. It had been finding him whenever he used magic by doing exactly what he was doing now. The creature did not suck up the nearby lightstalks as it had previously done. It charged directly towards him. Nex realized the sheer amount of spells he had cast. It didn’t even need to search for him. \nTo it, he probably stuck out like a spot of blood on a clean linen shirt. He began throwing magic stones out of his satchel trying to divert its attention, but it didn’t even turn its head. As he threw the stones, he noticed the waves. They resembled ripples rather than waves, going out in evenly spaced packs, like a military unit marching in step. Soon, he heard thunderous pounding just over the horizon that shook the earth and rattled Nex’s teeth. He could see the creature cock its head, then sprint even faster at him. Nex would normally have multiple ways of potentially dealing with this creature, but he realized his magic would probably be absorbed by this creature anyway. He had to think calmly. He glanced back at the creature and could now see its claws rising above the lightstalks and fur tumbling. Its fur pulsed in a pattern that waved from its head to its rear making it seem like it was going even faster. Nex knew it must have been an optical illusion but that didn’t stop him from tucking down his chin and focusing solely on how to run even faster.\nAs he ran, he could see the source of the monstrous noise as two gigantic pillars of chiseled stone, the size of a mountain rose, and fell asynchronously. Nex glanced at his makeshift compass in between strides. It switched between each as it was being raised off the ground. The magic causing the rocks to rise must be what is causing his compass to switch. In between these massive pillars, there was a small rectangular shape. Nex squinted. He had recognized that shape. The shape he had been begging to see for ages. The release from his prison. An ornate door. \nThe left rock fell, and Nex lost his footing as the earth shifted under him. The creature made a sound even more thunderous than the rock falling. It was close. He jumped up and started running again. He could hear it sprinting towards him. He could ever so slightly feel the vacuum. He had to find a way to get rid of his magic. His eyes sparkled as an idea formed. Quickly, Nex opened his satchel and grabbed the stones, and held them in his hand. It was the adrenaline that allowed him to keep not immediately topple as he suddenly grew nauseous. His body was lit aflame with pain, but he kept running. If he didn’t endure the pain, he was going to die anyway. The creature began shifting its horns side to side and Nex noticed the lightstalks dimming. They are sending out magic whenever he touches them. When he had first lost the beast, he had stopped moving. He gritted his teeth as the pain dialed up. He could feel his nerves rioting. If he was wrong, he was dead, but he couldn’t keep going like this. The beast would catch him. He turned around and stopped. The beast didn’t. It continued running forward, now vigorously shaking its head. It slowed down and came to a halt a few feet ahead of Nex. Carefully, it sniffed the ground with its horns touching a lightstalk that wilted immediately. Nex could see its grotesque features up close. Its teeth were the size of his ring finger. Its head the size of his whole body. Every time it breathed, a warm wind would come rushing towards him. He started seeing stars. If he didn’t let go of the stones they were going to kill him. If he did, the beast would kill him. He was trying to weigh his options, but either one ended with him dead. He looked to the door. It was so close. He was so close to being free. He faltered as the ever-growing pain shot at his heart again. With that, Nex threw the stones away from the door and started running. \n\nHe began to run faster than he’s ever run in his life. The beast had initially turned to look at the stones, but it found his scent and bounded after him. He cursed his legs for not being able to take him even faster. The designs on the door were more self-evident. He stumbled as the ground below him shook from the pillar on the right making contact with the earth. His ears began to ring, but he didn’t dare falter again as he heard the beast’s mouth open and the sound of metal clanging against itself formed. However, his eyes never left their target. He watched it as if it would disappear if he looked away for even a second. It came closer and closer until Nex could feel the grainy texture under his fingers. He went for the knob, then ran into it.\n\nNex felt a great pain in his stomach. A sharp, gnawing pain that refused to stop. He felt as if it had shrunk to the size of a dried treaut that even insects would find as an unsatisfying meal. His throat was dry. It was drier than any desert he’d read about. He felt the tumbleweeds roll as he tried to quench it with his own saliva. He was starkly aware of his need to breathe. Each raspy, arid breath caused his lazy lungs to fill and flatten in a rhythm that was annoyingly methodical. He had gone so long without needing any of these necessities that now they seemed alien to him. He looked around to see a vast library with rows upon rows of books and a smiling face looking down on him. \n“It only took you a moon? Maybe it was a little too easy then. I surely underestimated you”\nNex shouted, “A moon? What are you talking about I was there for ye-” He interrupted himself as he noticed his beard was gone.\n“Time works a bit differently in the Oneiro,” Jayen commented then sighed, “So, what did you learn?”\nNext shouted, “That wasn’t a test, it was a prison!”\nJayen nodded, “You are correct. It is one. One that many have perished in.”\nNex’s cheeks reddened and his nostrils flared, “why would you send me there? What have I done to deserve this?”\n“To show you what you are capable of. I had watched you come to my door over and over. Like I had said, I would have taken you as my student long ago, but it would appear that in your own heart, you felt yourself unworthy.” Nex’s face slightly softened at that.\nJayen continued, “I couldn’t train you if you would constantly doubt yourself, so I devised this test to rid you of those feelings.” \nNex took a hard long look at Jayen,“To Lyfe with you, Jayen Wen.”"

Really get to know my writing style with this one:\n\"\nTherapeutic ultrasound has been used for imaging and treating various conditions due to its penetration depth and thermal effects[19.]. Similar to electromagnetic radiation, the penetration depth of ultrasound is highly dependent on the signal frequency. Typically ultrasound can be categorized by low power/low frequency or high power/high frequency. High-intensity ultrasound, often over 1000W/cm2, generally is used for its thermal properties as the vibrations cause heat to be generated in the target tissue. 1 MHz ultrasound has been shown to penetrate up to 2.3 to 5 cm, while 3 MHz ultrasound can penetrate up to 0.8 to 1.6 cm deep[19.]. Generally, ultrasound cannot be applied across the skull because of the massive attenuation at the skin-bone interface. The attenuation causes heat as the lost acoustic energy is converted into thermal energy. However, to account for the attenuation through the skull, phased \nSignal Type\nPenetration Depth\nSpatial Resolution\nNIR light\n2mm\n0.05mm\nMicrowaves\n50mm\n4mm\nUltrasound\n30mm\n1-2mm\nMagnetic Fields\n50mm \n10mm\n\nTable 2: Comparison of the three primary signals\n There exists an inverse relationship between penetration depth and spatial resolution in primary signals. As depicted in Table 2, NIR light, the ideal visible light primary signal, can only penetrate 4.4mm into tissue allowing for stimulation of the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. Microwaves and TMS can penetrate approximately 50mm into the brain, which would allow for stimulation of the entirety of the cerebrum. However, NIR light can be focused on a near-nanoscale under ideal conditions, while TMS and microwaves can only be focused on a centimeter scale. Transcranial Doppler can penetrate 30mm into the brain while having a millimeter-scale resolution, falling between the two extremes. Given the inverse relationship of penetration depth to spatial resolution, the primary signals could be combined by utilizing different nFNIs to achieve deep stimulation without sacrificing spatial resolution.\nNano Functional Neural Interfaces\n Nano functional neural interfaces are an emerging field within Functional Neural Interfaces that could potentially revolutionize neuroscience as a whole. As shown in figure 1, nFNIs are nanotransducers capable of converting a primary external signal to a secondary form of energy that can activate an ion channel. Likewise, they can receive the secondary form of energy from the ion channel/neuron and convert it into the primary form of energy. As discussed in the Primary Signals section, electromagnetic radiation, Ultrasound, and Magnetic force are the three primary signals used in nFNIs. However, various forms of energy can be used as a secondary signal, such as electrical, magnetic, thermal, optical, and mechanical energies[7.]. \nNumber\nPrimary Signal\nSecondary Signal\nMaterial\nBinding Target\n1\nVIS light\nElectric field\nQuantum Dots(CdSe)\nMembrane/intracellular/\nvoltage-gated ion channels\n2\nMagnetic Field\nElectric field\nCoFe2O4-BaTiO3\nMembrane/intracellular/\nvoltage-gated ion channels\n3\nUltrasound\nElectric field\nPiezocrystals(Barium Titanate)\nMembrane/intracellular/\nvoltage-gated ion channels\n4\nVIS/NIR light\nHeat\nGold nanomaterials\nTRPV1 Ion channels\n5\nMagnetic field\nHeat\nSuperparamagnetic materials(Manganese ferrite)\nTRPV1 Ion channels\n6\nNIR light\nUV/Vis\nNaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles\nlight-sensitive ion channels (ChRs, Chrimson, Jaws)\n7\nMagnetic Field\nMechanical Force\nMagnetite nanoparticles\nMembrane/mechano-gated ion channels(DEG, K2P)\n\n Table 3: Comparing the current state of art nano functional neural interfaces[7,20, 35,36]. The first three nFNIs listed are nano electrotransducers(optoelectric, magnetoelectric, and piezoelectric). Rows 4 and 5 depicted Nano thermotransducers(optothermal and magnetothermal). Row 6 shows a nano optotransducer, and Row 7 depicts a nano mechanotransducer.\n As depicted in Table 3, there are currently seven nanotransducers that promise to create a stable nFNI. The seven transducers can be broken into four groups: electrotransducers, thermotransducers, optotransducers, and mechanotransducers. \nOptotransducers utilize optogenetics to stimulate the ion channel. In optogenetics, creatures are genetically engineered to have light-sensitive ion channels called opsins onto the plasma membrane or have them artificially inserted[7.]. Opsins are engineered ion channels or pumps that respond to specific wavelengths of light to either inhibit or excite neurons. Three examples of opsins are depicted in Table 3. However, another method would be needed to detect the activity of the neuron. While light can stimulate the ion channel, the ion channel would not, in turn, produce light. Therefore, optotransducers would work as stimulators only.\nThermotransducers can take primary signals such as light or magnetic fields to create localized heat. TRP channels, specifically TRPV1, have been shown to be effective temperature-gated ion channels. The channels could be used to inhibit or excite neurons based on localized heating caused by these materials. Ferrous materials such as Manganese ferrite have been shown to be effective magnetothermal transducers[36]. \nOf the seven transducers, optoelectronic, magnetoelectric, piezoelectric, and magnetomechanical nanotransducers will be explored as options for an nFNI because the above-listed transducers are bidirectional. \nOptoelectronic Transducers\nQuantum dots (QD) are semiconducting nanocrystals with properties that allow them to transport electrons. Cadmium selenide (CdSe) is the most common QD, consisting of heavy metal and a nonmetal. The heavy metal acts as the core of the QD, and an additional coating is typically added for stability and biocompatibility. Depending on their material, size, and shape, QDs can be fine-tuned to emit or absorb specific wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR) due to quantum confinement[9.]. Quantum confinement occurs when the particle size is too small to be comparable to the wavelength of an electron. The phenomenon allows for high photostability and quantum efficiency. For these reasons, quantum dots are being used more readily for clinical purposes such as fluorescent labeling, cancer treatment, and drug delivery[9.]. They are useful in these applications due to their ability to be used as a platform to image while also being small enough to travel through the bloodstream. \nQD exhibits optoelectric properties to generate photocurrent [9.]. Once excited, QDs momentarily create an electric dipole moment, which induces an electric field. If a QD can be coupled with a neuron within 10 nm[20.] of the plasma membrane either by use of an anchor protein or floating in a substrate, the electric field generated may be enough to create an action potential. Neurons typically have a resting voltage of approximately -70mV. For the neuron to begin depolarizing, creating an action potential, the voltage would need to be raised to -55mV meaning the nFNIs would need to transduce 15mV to cause the neuron to fire[21.].While additional research is require to demonstrate the energy conversion efficiency of QDs on a nanoscale, QDs have been used for photovoltaics in recent studies that demonstrated, on a macroscale, an efficiency of 66%[37]. \nWhile QDs can allow for an attenuated signal to generate an action potential, NIR light would first need to make it to the transducers to stimulate the QDs. A benefit to this model is that QDs can be tailored to their needed application, but if the coating is degraded, the heavy metal core could be toxic[12.]. They have shown cytotoxicity towards cells in vitro due to the release of free Cadmium[22.]. However, quantum dots have not been shown to be toxic in humans, so further experimentation should be done before the assumption that QDs are toxic in humans would be needed. \nMagnetic Transducers \nMagnetic nanoparticles have been investigated for medical applications such as magnetic separation of biological entities, nano-drug delivery, cancer treatment, and MRI. However, there has been a recent push in using magnetic particles for neural interfacing. Similar to QDs, magnetic nanoparticles typically consist of a metallic core paired with a shell to make the interface biocompatible and stable. Typically the internal cores can be made from iron-cobalt alloys with a coating that protects the interface from oxidation[23.]. Still, once again, the coating of the interface is highly dependent on the nature of the tasks. In the following section, magnetoelectric nanoparticles(MENs) and magnetomechanical nanoparticles(MMNs) will be investigated. \nMagnetoelectric Nanotransducers \nIn a study conducted by Gudurut et al., EEG waveforms of live mice were shown to be modulated by 30nm CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 magnetoelectric core-shell nanoparticles under low energy magnetic fields(20 Oe at 20 Hz).CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 was chosen specifically for this study due to its powerful magneto-electric effect due to strain-induced coupling between the magnetostrictive cobalt ferrite cores and piezoelectric barium titanate shells [24.]. In another investigation conducted by Nguyen et al., it was found that by using magnetic nanoparticles localized to a specific region of the brain, a local electric field of 1000V/m could be induced with roughly 50 mT at 10 Hz. The result is especially significant because standard transcranial magnetic stimulation requires approximately 1T to produce a similar effect[25.].\nWhile the initial finding for MENs shows they have promise as stable nFNIs, further investigation is needed to confirm their properties. In the study conducted by Gudurut et al., the cytotoxicity of MENs was performed. In this study, the magnetic nanoparticles were coated with glycerol mono-oleate. They found no significant toxicity for human neuron cells in vitro in a concentration range up to 200 μg/ml[25.].\nMagnetomechanical Nanotransducers\nMMNs capable of mechanically modulating cell response has been established in the field. Typically, MMNs are bound to the plasma membrane using collagen or an equivalent binding protein. They are able to apply pico-newton forces to stretch ion channels via particle twisting[26.]. MMNs can have iron oxide, magnetite, or hematite cores, and they can also have silica, collagen, starch, or dextran coatings, depending on the type of cell they are being bound to[26.]. While most studies conducted on MMNs were conducted in non-excitable cells, the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels can be transferred to neural modulation. In particular, one study demonstrates the potential for MMNs[27.]. They used MMNs with magnetite cores coated with starch to target ion channels attempting to cause a calcium influx in cortical neurons. By utilizing a magnetic field of 110mT, they were able to induce a significant calcium influx in transgenic mechanosensitive ion channels, which is a tenth of the energy needed to induce a calcium influx using TMS[28.]. \n\""

Likewise, piezoelectric materials can receive electricity and convert it into mechanical stress. It has many applications, such as power sources, sensors, and motors. \n There have been many studies in vitro that show the potential that piezoelectric nFNIs could potentially be stable. Boron nitride nanotubes were used to stimulate PC-12, C2C12 cells, and SH-SY5Y cells to see if neurite growth would be expedited with electrical stimulation, which was found to be true[7.]. In another study, barium titanate was electrostatically attached to SH-SY5Y and induced calcium influxes when stimulated by ultrasound. Both of the nanoparticles were dispersed into the media, and they were rapidly internalized by the cells. As stated previously for quantum dots, the internalization of nFNIs is highly non-ideal due to the impossibility of retrieval. Likewise, the amount of energy produced by the vibrating nano piezo crystals is still unknown, meaning it may not be powerful enough to generate an action potential. \n Another relatively unknown aspect is the biocompatibility of the different piezocrystals. Boron nitride has been shown in vitro to not exhibit any toxicity in human kidney cells [29.], and barium titanate showed minimal toxicity in mouse osteoblasts 7F2 cells as it caused a nonsignificant inflammatory response[30.]. \nDesigning a theoretical system\n In this section of the paper, a theoretical brain-computer interface will be designed based on the current state of nFNIs. Ideally, the system would be capable of targeting a specific region of the brain in a safe, practical manner that would allow for high-resolution, bidirectional communication. The system would be designed for humans. Therefore, it would need to be made from materials approved for human use or have been proven to show no toxicity to human cells. Ideally, this system’s operation would not cause a significant temperature increase. The mean temperature of the brain is 38.4°C[31.], and at 40°C heatstrokes can occur[32.]. Therefore, the temperature should not be raised by 1°C to ensure patient safety. Lastly, the long-term viability of the neural interfaces used will be used to establish whether or not the system would be viable for long-term placement, and methods of complete retrieval will be investigated. \n The three types of signals viable for deep stimulation of human neurons are light, magnetic fields, and ultrasound. There seems to exist a tradeoff between spatial resolution and penetration depth. NIR light has a relatively low penetration depth of 4.4mm, but a spatial resolution of 0.05mm. Conversely, magnetic fields have a relatively good penetration depth of 5 cm. Still, they also have a low spatial resolution of 1 cm. Lastly, microwaves have a penetration depth of 5cm and a spatial resolution of 4mm. However, nFNIs being bound directly to target neurons will allow for precise stimulation regardless of spatial resolution. \n\nA fundamental problem with the three types of stimulation is that the signal depth is not deep enough to stimulate the brain’s deepest recesses from the surface. The average human brain has dimensions of 167mmx140mmx93mm[33.].\n \nEquation 1: Volume of an Ellipsoid where a equals the horizontal semi-axis(length), b equals the vertical semi-axis(height), and c equals the original axis (depth)\nUnder the assumption that the average brain’s area can be represented by an ellipsoid, the area affected by the primary signals can be calculated. Using the equation, the average volume of the human brain is approximately 1138 cm3. \nPrimary Energy Type\nThe volume of the brain affected in cm3\nPercentage of the Brain affected\nNIR\n223\n20.0%\nUltrasound\n641\n56.3%\nMagnetic\n901\n79.2%\nMicrowave\n901\n79.2%\n\nTable 4: Calculation of the Percentage of the brain affected by the different primary signals.\n\nIn the above table, the maximum penetration depth was utilized to approximate how much of the brain each primary signal could affect. Using equation 1, the penetration depth was subtracted from the radius of each dimension resulting in an ellipsoid of reduced size. The resulting ellipsoid represented the area unaffected by the signal, so each smaller ellipsoid was subtracted from the average volume of the human brain, 1138 cm3 to obtain the area affected by the signal. For the system to be a suitable advancement in the functional neural interfaces, nFNIs would need to be capable of modulation at any depth. Therefore, a system would need to account for the relatively low signal depth and unique properties of nFNIs. \nMany inventions are biomimetic in nature. To solve the dilemma of insufficient signal depth, I propose looking to neurons to provide an answer. Neurons can carry electrical signals across the body despite their relatively low power by using axons that are activated once the neuron is activated. Similarly, when stimulated, nFNIs could produce a secondary signal in their local area, potentially activating ion channels. However, instead of activating ion channels, the nFNIs could activate other nFNIs that can propagate the signal deeper into the brain. These long chains could essentially act as self-constructing nanowires that travel directly to the target neuron. These nanowires could work in networks or independently, but they could allow for deep ultrasonic, magnetic, or even optical stimulation. Likewise, recording nanowires could propagate signals received from neurons to relay activity to the surface of the brain, where they can be readily recorded. Ideally, the recording nanowires would be different nFNIs than the stimulating nFNIs to avoid noise or false positive signals. Likewise, the relay nFNIs would also be distinct from the stimulating nFNIs to avoid unintentional stimulation of nontargeted neurons while propagating the signal. \n\nFigure 4: The above figure depicts the proposed method for using scaffolding proteins to make nanowires. Each scaffolding protein would have three magnetic nanoparticles (one on the top, middle, and bottom). The magnetic nanoparticles would propagate the magnetic signal until it reached the magnetoelectric nanotransducer (figure on the left). The figure on the right depicts a similar system. However, the last scaffolding protein has a MMN attached to the end, which would be used to stimulate the piezoelectric crystal.\n Of the four nFNIs previously described, only three will be considered for the system. MMNs, MENS, and piezocrystals all exhibited minimal to no cytotoxicity, but QDs have shown to be highly toxic if the coating dissolves. While it may have interesting properties, it should not be used in humans for a practical system. Therefore with the restriction that the system would require different nFNIs for stimulation, relay, and recording, MMNs, MENs, and piezocrystals will be evaluated for their ability for each role. \nPiezocrystals and MENs would most likely serve as the best stimulating nFNI. Piezocrystals could be a good option due to the universality of electricity in modulating/activating neurons. MMNs would not be as good of a candidate because mechanosensitive ion channels are not as prevalent as voltage-gated ion channels. Electricity offers a reliable method of altering excitability throughout various neurons. For MENs to be a stimulating nFNI, a nanowire composed of magnetic nanoparticles would need to be used as the relay signal to propagate the signal to the neuron. For piezocrystals to be an ideal stimulating nFNI, MMNs could be used as the relay nFNI because they could mechanically stress the piezocrystal resulting in an electric charge. However, for the attached MMN to receive the signal, a nanowire made of nanomagnets would also need to be attached to the MMN. Experimentation would need to be conducted to determine which method would be superior as both show potential for the modulation of neurons.\nFor the recording nFNI, neuronal electrical activity will need to be detected and propagated to the brain’s surface for simplified measurement. Therefore, piezo crystals or MENs would be the best candidates. Ideally, the recording nanowires would differ in signal propagation methods than the stimulating nanowires, but it does not mean the system would be incapable of functioning as intended. The problem can be solved by ensuring the nanowire has some form of insulation to hinder the spread of the signal. The insulation can be in the form of a substrate or binding protein, as discussed later. MENs will most likely prove to be the most efficient recording nFNI. It can convert the received electrical input from the neuron directly into a magnetic field that can be propagated through the wire. Near the brain’s surface, the tail-end of the wire would be topped with a corresponding MEN to convert the signal to electricity for measurement. \nWhile most of the current studies involving nFNIs occurring in vitro show stable neural interfaces, the neural interfaces may not necessarily be stable in vivo. With this in mind, the nanowire would need to be anchored to the ion channels of the target neuron and the skull for efficient signal propagation. Having the nFNIs bound to a protein would reduce the likelihood of internalization of the individual particle. Likewise, if the particles are in the form of nanowires, it would significantly reduce the chance of internalization. Ideally, the protein would be a durable, biocompatible material capable of binding to the respective nFNI, isolating the signal produced by the nFNI, and binding to other proteins to form the nanowires. Due to the specificity of the requirements needed for such a protein, there has not been any evidence in the literature of such a protein. Scaffolding proteins show an interesting starting point for investigation. Scaffolding proteins typically help to relay messages between the cell membrane and the nucleus[34.]. If a scaffolding protein could be designed to hold the magnetic nanoparticles as shown in figure 4, it would allow for testing of the proposed nano interface. \nFuture Perspectives\n Nano functional neural interfaces is a rapidly developing field with many vital insights being found daily. In this paper, QDs, MENs, MMNs, and piezocrystals were investigated for their biocompatibility, feasibility, and potential for use in a theoretical brain-computer interface. nFNIs show great potential in overcoming the insensibility and indistinguishability problems currently held by the field as a whole. However, nFNIs are still limited by the penetration depth and spatial resolution of the stimulating signals. For the field to progress, noninvasive stimulation methods would need to advance, allowing for higher spatial resolution and greater depth. In this paper, a potential solution was proposed to the problem in the form of protein chains containing nFNIs to relay the signal bidirectionally. The proposed solution would require the discovery of a protein capable of handling the design requirements needed to bind to the nFNIs, insulate the signal, and form durable chains that will need to be investigated further. If these advancements are made, the proposed solution could potentially help to push the understanding of the brain to new levels.\n\""

However, many current FNIs are highly invasive, not feasible in humans, or can only record from, at most, one region of the brain. My research focuses on nano functional neural interfaces (nFNIs) to solve the stated problems. My penultimate goal is to design and safely implement a system that allows for high-resolution, bidirectional communication with the nervous system while being minimally invasive. I’ve been enthralled with creating this system since I was in elementary school. It is a project that will need many interdisciplinary technological advances to achieve, but I believe that such a system would have many extraordinary impacts on both research and society. \n While I am specifically interested in researching nFNIs, I wanted to ensure that I had a wide range of research experience in neuroscience to better myself as a researcher. I had the honor of taking part in the 2020 summer undergraduate research program in Computational Neuroscience hosted by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Due to the coronavirus, the internship was converted to an online format, which required me to work mostly independently. I worked in Dr. Aaron Batista’s lab under the guidance of his graduate student Erinn Grigsby where another student and I studied “Decoder Performance Classified as a Function of Neurons.” \nIn this study, we investigated the impact of neuron dropping on decoder performance. By utilizing my skills in Matlab, we created three different Kalman filters and linear regression decoders. Each decoder contained different position, velocity, and velocity-position decoders to test, which was the most robust to neuron dropping. Despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, we virtually presented our work at the Center of the Neural Basis of Cognition. Getting the chance to work in Dr. Batista’s lab was by far the most rewarding experience in my professional career. The experience enriched my ability to decipher papers to find pertinent information. It strengthened my ability to pose a question and find an objective method to answer it. Most importantly, I gained an in-depth knowledge of how brain-computer interface decoders operate and first-hand experience developing and designing them. On top of my other coursework and projects, I am continuing my research into brain-computer interface decoders with my partner, explicitly investigating how modulation depth and preferred direction factor into decoder performance as neurons are dropped. We hope to see if specific neurons are essential for decoding a particular action than other neurons. \nAs part of my senior thesis at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am a part of a team, under the guidance of Dr. Dirk Albrecht, investigating the dosing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, dystonia, essential tremor, and epilepsy. Our primary goal is to find a method of optimizing the procedure of finding the correct dosage of frequency, pulse width, and voltage for each unique individual. We aim to conduct this study utilizing C. elegans as a model system because of the animal’s completed connectome. Knowing the connectome may help see the underlying mechanisms that effectively allow DBS to treat the previously stated diseases. We hope that by identifying the underlying mechanisms of DBS, the treatment might be optimized.\nUsing what I’ve learned from my previous research experiences, I am currently conducting a formal independent study into neural nanotransducers. One of the most considerable problems with non-invasive stimulation and imaging of neurons is that signals are dispersed or attenuated as they pass through the skull and tissue matter. Typically, the trade-off for having a stable signal deeper into the brain is by being more invasive. However, in this study, I hypothesize that nFNIs can be used as a relay system to send and receive external devices’ signals. The hypothesis is based on the biomimicry of neurons themselves. In the example of an “imaging” nFNI, it would receive the information of a neuron firing and transduce the signal. A nearby relay nFNI would then relay that signal until it reached the skull where the signal could be read. The process would function conversely for signals sent to a specific neuron. \nMy current theory is nanowires composed of magnetic nanoparticles bound together by a protein chain could act as the relay nFNIs with magnetoelectric nFNIs at the end to send/receive signals. The wire would self-assemble using the proteins, which would also insulate the signal to reduce noise. Ideally, the wire would attach itself to the skull and the targeted neuron allowing for direct stimulation. The exploration of this concept is what I’d like to make into my dissertation at Rice University. Rice has shown to be the pinnacle in regards to nano neural engineering through countless innovations done by its world-class staff. I knew Rice was perfect for me after pouring over the research conducted as I investigated nFNIs. With their guidance, I can use nFNIs to design and implement a minimally-invasive, bidirectional brain-computer interface.\nAfter my time at Rice University, I hope to found a research company centered around research further into nFNIs and making this BCI safely usable by humans. Ultimately, I hope the BCI would be a versatile treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease by allowing direct activation and monitoring of the affected neurons. The BCI could also enhance neuroprosthetics by allowing sensations such as touch to be sent back to the brain. The number of medical and scientific advancements possible with this technology are genuinely countless. The creation of this system will be my life’s work that I have been doing since I was in middle school. I hope to continue this work at Rice University, where I’ll get the guidance I could not receive anywhere else."

I always questioned the environment around me, and the word why was my best friend, much to the displeasure of the adults around me. Even now, I strive to always look at things from a different perspective and come at problems without any preconceived notions of what is possible. Hence why when the idea first came to me to make neural nanomachines (NNMs) when I was 16, I didn’t wave it off as an impossibility or science fiction. Instead, I thought of all the technologies we use today that people even just two decades ago would deem impossible, and I began researching how I could turn this science fictional concept into reality. \n What are neural nanomachines? The machines will form a system of bidirectional smart transducers that, once injected, can navigate through the blood-brain barrier and attach themselves near the axons of neurons. Once anchored in place, some source of safe external energy such would induce a charge in the NNMs which could activate the action potential for the neuron. Likewise whenever the neuron fires, the NNMs could emit a form of energy that can be picked up by an external headset that will convert signals into data that can be processed and analyzed. With such an advanced brain-machine interface, neurodegenerative diseases and mental illness could be more effectively diagnosed, treated, and perhaps even cured. Amputees could have their appendages replace by prosthetics that allow them to feel and move just like their original. Educators could tailor individualized curricula based on how students truly learn best. With this technology, the possibilities advancements in science, medicine, education, and culture are limitless. There are researchers currently working on making neural nanomachines, but with the current technology, it currently isn’t possible to safely make a system without harming the brain and user. \nThree of the main issues preventing this technology from being implemented are finding a reliable way to obtain data through the medium(skin, flesh, and bones) with negligible interference, finding a way to deliver power the NNMs through said media, and preventing the brain from being heated by the NNMs once they are powered. My current approach is to research and create a material or combination of materials that could address all of these problems and allow the creation and implementation of NNMs. The materials would have to be biocompatible and able to stay inside the body for long durations without corroding or degrading. It would also have to have a similar property as piezo crystals that would allow it to convert some form of energy into electricity to stimulate individual neurons, but also, it would have to be able to receive electricity and emit a detectable form of energy from within the brain without causing harm to the neuron or the brain. \n The reason why I am applying specifically to your program is that I believe by taking part in this internship I will get the research experience and forge the path to me being able to get into graduate school. I plan to take my research to graduate school where I hope to achieve my Ph.D. in Neuroengineering/Neuroscience. Then, I plan on making my own research company with the sole goal of researching NNMs and the applications that the technology could have once it is created. While I want to go for Neuroengineering, I need experience with nanotechnology in order to make the necessary materials that will make the NNMs viable and realistic. Your program is crucial for me in order to ensure I get this research experience and achieve my goal of one day creating the neural nanomachine."

        "value": "can you tell me if the answer to this question \"The need for achievement based on McClelland's acquired needs theory could be best satisfied by:\na. Becoming an influential leader.\nb. Being accepted by a group\nc. Being well liked\nd. setting/achieving challenging personal goals \n\" is readily answerable from this content \"When your team members succeed, you might be tempted to show them off to the rest of your organization. But while some people thrive in the spotlight, others dread being \"paraded around.\"\n\nManaging a group of people with different personalities is never easy. But if you're managing or leading a team, it's essential to know what motivates your people, how they respond to feedback and praise, and what tasks fit them well.\n\nDavid McClelland's Human Motivation Theory allows you to identify people's motivating drivers. This can then help you to give praise and feedback effectively, assign them suitable tasks, and keep them motivated.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore McClelland's Human Motivation Theory, and look at how you can use it to manage and lead your team more effectively.\n\nNote:\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory is also known as Three Needs Theory, Acquired Needs Theory, Motivational Needs Theory, and Learned Needs Theory.\n\nUnderstanding McClelland's Theory\nIn the early 1940s, Abraham Maslow created his theory of needs. This identified the basic needs that human beings have, in order of their importance: physiological needs, safety needs, and the needs for belonging, self-esteem and \"self-actualization\".\n\nLater, David McClelland built on this work in his 1961 book, \"The Achieving Society.\" He identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. [1]\n\nAccording to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).\n\nMcClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are as follows:\n\nDominant Motivator\n\nCharacteristics of This Person\n\nAchievement\n\nHas a strong need to set and accomplish challenging goals.\nTakes calculated risks to accomplish their goals.\nLikes to receive regular feedback on their progress and achievements.\nOften likes to work alone.\nAffiliation\n\nWants to belong to the group.\nWants to be liked, and will often go along with whatever the rest of the group wants to do.\nFavors collaboration over competition.\nDoesn't like high risk or uncertainty.\nPower\n\nWants to control and influence others.\nLikes to win arguments.\nEnjoys competition and winning.\nEnjoys status and recognition.\nNote:\nThose with a strong power motivator are often divided into two groups: personal and institutional. People with a personal power drive want to control others, while people with an institutional power drive like to organize the efforts of a team to further the company's goals. As you can probably imagine, those with an institutional power need are usually more desirable as team members!\n\nUsing the Theory\nMcClelland's theory can help you to identify the dominant motivators of people on your team. You can then use this information to influence how you set goals and provide feedback, and how you motivate and reward team members.\n\nYou can also use these motivators to craft, or design, the job around your team members, ensuring a better fit.\n\nLet's look at the steps for using McClelland's theory:\n\nStep 1: Identify Drivers\nExamine your team to determine which of the three motivators is dominant for each person. You can probably identify drivers based on personality and past actions.\n\nFor instance, perhaps one of your team members always takes charge of the group when you assign a project. They speak up in meetings to persuade people, and delegate responsibilities to others to meet the goals of the group. They like to be in control of the final deliverables. This team member is likely primarily driven by power.\n\nYou might have another team member who never speaks during meetings. They always agree with the group, work hard to manage conflict when it occurs, and visibly become uncomfortable when you talk about doing high-risk, high-reward projects. This person is likely to have a strong need for affiliation.\n\nStep 2: Structure Your Approach\nBased on the driving motivators of your workers, structure your leadership style and project assignments around each individual team member. This will help ensure that they all stay engaged, motivated, and happy with the work they're doing.\n\nExamples of Using the Theory\nLet's take a closer look at how to manage team members who are driven by each of McClelland's three motivators:\n\nAchievement\nPeople motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.\n\nWhen providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.\n\nAffiliation\nPeople motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.\n\nWhen providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.\n\nPower\nThose with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.\n\nWhen providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals.\n\nComparative Theories\nMcClelland's theory of needs is not the only theory about worker motivation. Sirota's Three-Factor Theory also presents three motivating factors that workers need to stay motivated and excited about what they're doing: equity/fairness, achievement, and camaraderie.\n\nSirota's theory states that we all start a new job with lots of enthusiasm and motivation to do well. But over time, due to bad company policies and poor work conditions, many of us lose our motivation and excitement.\n\nThis is different from McClelland's theory, which states that we all have one dominant motivator that moves us forward, and this motivator is based on our culture and life experiences.\n\nUse your best judgment when motivating and engaging your team. Understanding a variety of motivational theories will help you decide which approach is best in any given situation.\n\nNote:\nYou may also see these abbreviations for McClelland's three motivators: Achievement (nAch), Affiliation (nAff), and Power (nPow).\n\nKey Points\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory states that every person has one of three main driving motivators: the needs for achievement, affiliation, or power. These motivators are not inherent; we develop them through our culture and life experiences.\n\nAchievers like to solve problems and achieve goals. Those with a strong need for affiliation don't like to stand out or take risk, and they value relationships above anything else. Those with a strong power motivator like to control others and be in charge.\n\nYou can use this information to lead, praise, and motivate your team more effectively, and to better structure your team's roles.\""

Then, you can use the gTTS library to convert text into speech.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that uses YOLOv3 to detect objects in an image and gTTS to convert the detected object labels into speech:\n```python\nimport cv2\nfrom keras.models import load_model\nfrom gtts import gTTS\nimport os\n\n# Load YOLOv3 model\nmodel = load_model('yolov3.h5')\n\n# Load image\nimg = cv2.imread('example.jpg')\n\n# Perform object detection\n# ...\n\n# Convert object labels to speech\nobjects = ['car', 'person', 'dog'] # example list of detected objects\ntext = ', '.join(objects)\ntts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')\ntts.save('example.mp3')\n\n# Play the speech using the OS default media player\nos.system('example.mp3')\n```\n1. Once you have created the Python script, you can use a tool like Kivy to create an Android app that runs the Python script. Kivy is a Python library that allows you to create cross-platform apps for desktop and mobile devices using a single codebase.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that creates a simple Kivy app that runs the above Python script when a button is pressed:\n```python\nimport kivy\nfrom kivy.app import App\nfrom kivy.uix.button import Button\nimport subprocess\n\nclass MyApp(App):\n    def build(self):\n        button = Button(text='Detect objects and speak')\n        button.bind(on_press=self.detect_objects_and_speak)\n        return button\n\n    def detect_objects_and_speak(self, instance):\n        subprocess.Popen(['python', 'script.py'])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    MyApp().run()\n```\n1. Finally, you can build and run the Kivy app on your Android device using Android Studio. You can use the Kivy Buildozer tool to package the Python script and Kivy app into a standalone Android APK file.\n\nHere is an example command that builds the APK file:\n```\nluaCopied!buildozer android debug deploy run\n\n```\nNote that this is just a high-level overview of the steps involved. The exact details may depend on your specific requirements and setup."

There are many approaches you can take to solve these kinds of problems, and the specific method you choose will depend on the nature of the problem and the specific constraints you are working with.\n\nHere are some general steps that you can follow to approach a multi-variate optimization problem:\n\n1. Define the problem: Clearly define the objective you are trying to optimize, as well as any constraints or limitations that may impact your solution. This will help you identify the key variables you need to consider in your optimization.\n2. Identify the variables: List out all the variables that could potentially impact your optimization problem. Be sure to include any independent variables, constraints, and other relevant factors that may influence the outcome.\n3. Formulate a mathematical model: Create a mathematical model that represents the problem and incorporates all the relevant variables and constraints. This could involve using a set of equations or inequalities that describe the relationships between the variables and constraints.\n4. Choose an optimization method: Select an optimization method that is appropriate for your problem. Common methods include linear programming, nonlinear programming, evolutionary algorithms, and other optimization techniques.\n5. Test and refine the solution: Use your chosen optimization method to find the optimal solution to the problem. Check the results to ensure they are consistent with your initial objective and any constraints you have set. If necessary, refine your model and run the optimization process again to obtain a better solution.\n6. Evaluate the results: Evaluate the results of your optimization to see if they meet your expectations and objectives. You may need to perform sensitivity analysis to ensure that your solution is robust and will work under a range of conditions.\n\nOverall, solving a multi-variate optimization problem requires a combination of mathematical modeling, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills. By following these steps, you can develop a systematic approach to solving complex optimization problems and arrive at an optimal solution that meets your needs."

These tools can generate random notes and intervals for you to identify, and they can also provide feedback to help you improve.\n3. Practice regularly: Consistency is key when it comes to developing relative pitch skills. Practice every day, even if it's just for a few minutes.\n4. Sing: Singing is a great way to develop your relative pitch skills. Try to sing along with your favorite songs and pay attention to the notes and intervals.\n5. Take lessons: Consider taking music lessons with a qualified teacher who can help you develop your relative pitch skills. A teacher can provide personalized feedback and help you improve more quickly.\n\nRemember that developing relative pitch takes time and effort, but with consistent practice and dedication, you can improve your skills over time."

The class has several member functions that allow adding, deleting, and manipulating nodes in the list.\n\nThe `LinkedList` class has a private nested structure called `ListNode` which represents a single node in the linked list. Each node contains a value of type T and a pointer to the next node in the list.\n\nThe `LinkedList` class has the following public member functions:\n\n* `LinkedList()`: a constructor that initializes the list by setting the head pointer to null.\n* `~LinkedList()`: a destructor that deletes all the nodes in the list.\n* `void appendNode(T)`: appends a new node containing the given value to the end of the list.\n* `void insertNode(T)`: inserts a new node containing the given value into the list, in its appropriate sorted position.\n* `void deleteNode(T)`: removes the first node in the list that contains the given value.\n* `void displayList() const`: displays the values in all nodes of the list, in the order they appear.\n* `void deleteSmallestNode()`: removes the node with the smallest value in the list.\n* `void deleteOccurrences(T)`: removes all nodes in the list that contain the given value.\n* `T kthElement(int k)`: returns the value of the kth element in the list.\n* `void deleteKthElement(int k)`: removes the kth element in the list.\n\nThe implementation of each function is as follows:\n\n* `appendNode(T)`:\n\t+ Create a new node and store the given value in it.\n\t+ If the list is empty, set the head pointer to the new node.\n\t+ Otherwise, traverse the list until the end is reached, then insert the new node as the last node.\n* `displayList() const`:\n\t+ Traverse the list, starting from the head pointer, and display the value in each node.\n* `insertNode(T)`:\n\t+ Create a new node and store the given value in it.\n\t+ If the list is empty, set the head pointer to the new node.\n\t+ Otherwise, traverse the list until the appropriate position for the new node is found, then insert the new node there.\n* `deleteNode(T)`:\n\t+ If the list is empty, do nothing.\n\t+ If the first node in the list contains the given value, delete it and set the head pointer to the next node.\n\t+ Otherwise, traverse the list until the first node containing the given value is found, then delete it and adjust the previous node's `next` pointer to skip over the deleted node.\n* `deleteSmallestNode()`:\n\t+ If the list is empty, do nothing.\n\t+ Otherwise, traverse the list to find the smallest value and its previous node, then delete the smallest node and adjust the previous node's `next` pointer to skip over the deleted node.\n* `deleteOccurrences(T)`:\n\t+ Traverse the list, starting from the head pointer, and delete all nodes that contain the given value. To delete a node, adjust the previous node's `next` pointer to skip over the deleted node.\n* `kthElement(int k)`:\n\t+ Traverse the list, starting from the head pointer, and return the value of the kth node in the list. If k is larger than the number of nodes in the list, return the default value of type T.\n* `deleteKthElement(int k)`:\n\t+ Traverse the list, starting from the head pointer, and delete the kth node in the list.

In a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, create a layer of sliced potatoes. Top the potatoes with half of the ground beef mixture, followed by a layer of banana slices.\n6. Repeat the layering process, starting with the remaining sliced potatoes, the rest of the ground beef mixture, and finishing with a layer of banana slices.\n7. Pour the beef broth evenly over the layers in the baking dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.\n8. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the top layer of bananas is caramelized.\n9. Remove the casserole from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. Enjoy your Tropical Beef and Potato Casserole!"

Here's an example of how you could implement an autocomplete UI using React:\n\nFirst, create a component that will render the autocomplete:\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Autocomplete({ options }) {\n  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n  const [filteredOptions, setFilteredOptions] = useState([]);\n\n  const handleInputChange = (event) => {\n    const inputValue = event.target.value;\n    setInputValue(inputValue);\n    const filteredOptions = options.filter(\n      (option) => option.toLowerCase().indexOf(inputValue.toLowerCase()) > -1\n    );\n    setFilteredOptions(filteredOptions);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />\n      <ul>\n        {filteredOptions.map((option) => (\n          <li key={option}>{option}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Autocomplete;\n```\nIn this example, we define the `Autocomplete` component and use the `useState` hook to manage the component's state. We pass in an array of options as a prop, which will be used to filter the options as the user types.\n\nInside the `handleInputChange` function, we filter the options based on the current input value and update the `filteredOptions` state. We then render the input field and a list of options that match the current input value.\n\nNow, you can use the `Autocomplete` component in your React application like this:\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Autocomplete from './Autocomplete';\n\nconst options = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'];\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Autocomplete Example</h1>\n      <Autocomplete options={options} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\nThis example will render an input field and a list of options that match the user's input value. As the user types, the list of options will update in real-time to show only the options that match the current input value.\n\nIf you're using Next.js, you can follow the same approach to create an autocomplete UI in a Next.js application. Simply create a component like the one above, and use it in your Next.js pages or components as needed."

The cost of equity can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nCost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta \\* (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)\n\nWhere:\n\n* Risk-Free Rate: The risk-free rate is the rate of return that can be earned on an investment with zero risk, such as a U.S. Treasury bond. It represents the minimum return that investors expect for taking on any level of risk.\n* Beta: Beta is a measure of the volatility of a company's stock price in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock price will move in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility and a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.\n* Market Return: The market return is the average return of the overall market, such as the S&P 500 index. It represents the return that investors expect to earn on a broad portfolio of stocks.\n\nFor example, if the risk-free rate is 2%, the beta of a company's stock is 1.5, and the market return is 8%, the cost of equity would be calculated as follows:\n\nCost of Equity = 2% + 1.5 \\* (8% - 2%) = 12%\n\nThis means that shareholders expect a return of 12% on their investment in the company."

Choose the background music: You will need to select a set of lofi music tracks that you want to use as the background music for your stream. Ensure that the tracks are not copyrighted, or you have the necessary licenses to use them.\n2. Set up a YouTube channel: If you don't already have a YouTube channel, create one. Once you have created your channel, you will need to verify your account and enable live streaming.\n3. Install FFmpeg: FFmpeg is a free, open-source software that can be used to stream video and audio content to YouTube. Install FFmpeg on your Linux server.\n4. Create a playlist: Using a text editor, create a playlist file that includes the URLs of the lofi music tracks you want to use. Save the file with the extension .m3u.\n5. Use FFmpeg to stream the playlist: Open a terminal window on your Linux server and use FFmpeg to stream the playlist to YouTube. The command will look something like this:\n```less\nffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i playlist.m3u -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -pix_fmt yuv420p -profile:v baseline -s 1920x1080 -f flv rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/your-stream-key\n```\nReplace `playlist.m3u` with the name of your playlist file and `your-stream-key` with your YouTube stream key.\n\n1. Start the stream: Once you have entered the FFmpeg command, your lofi stream will start. You can leave the terminal window open to monitor the stream.\n\nNote that this method streams video and audio, so you will need to have a static image or video file as the video source. You can use a simple image or video of a lofi animation or just a static image with the name of the stream. If you want to update this image, you will need to interrupt the stream, replace the file and restart the stream.\n\nAlso, ensure that your server has the necessary bandwidth and resources to maintain a 24/7 stream."

The primary function of the thyroid gland is to produce hormones that regulate metabolism, which is the rate at which your body uses energy.\n\nThe thyroid gland produces two main hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones are responsible for controlling the metabolic rate of most of the body's tissues, including the heart, muscles, and digestive system. They help to regulate the body's energy levels, growth and development, and body temperature.\n\nWhen the thyroid gland produces too much or too little of these hormones, it can lead to a range of health problems. For example, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can cause symptoms such as weight loss, anxiety, and an irregular heartbeat, while an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can cause symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, and depression."

It is the law that tells us to care for each other, to help each other, to lift each other up in times of need.\"\n\nThe legalists looked at each other, and then they turned away. They knew that they could not argue with the Teacher, but they were not ready to accept his message of love and compassion.\n\nAnd so the Teacher continued to teach his disciples, and to spread his message of hope and faith.

Because we don’t want to upload duplicate files, that are the same, we will create a function that checks if a file that is to be uploaded already exists.

For example, \"My opponent wants to cut funding for education, which means they don't care about the future of our children.\"\n3. False dichotomy: presenting only two options as if they are the only possibilities when there may be other options available. For example, \"You're either with us or against us.\"\n4. Slippery slope: suggesting that a particular action will inevitably lead to a series of negative consequences without providing evidence. For example, \"If we allow gay marriage, next we'll be allowing people to marry animals!\"\n5. Appeal to authority: using the opinion of an authority figure to support an argument without providing any evidence. For example, \"Dr. Smith says that vaccinations are dangerous, so they must be dangerous.\"\n6. Hasty generalization: drawing a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. For example, \"I had a bad experience with one taxi driver, so all taxi drivers must be terrible.\"\n7. Circular reasoning: using a conclusion as a premise, essentially repeating yourself. For example, \"The Bible is true because it says so.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples of logical fallacies. There are many more out there, but being aware of these common ones can help you recognize when they are being used in an argument."

This is where AI image generators come in.\n\nUsing AI image generators, filmmakers can input text prompts from a script and generate corresponding images. This can help to quickly create a visual representation of the story, without the need for hiring an artist to draw out each individual frame.\n\nNot only do AI image generators save time and money, but they can also help to spark the imagination of directors and animators. By generating a range of possible images for each scene, the filmmakers can explore different creative possibilities and find the best visual representation for the story.\n\nAdditionally, AI image generators can also be used to create concept art and other visual elements for the production. This can help to further develop the story and bring the filmmakers' vision to life.\n\nOverall, AI technology is proving to be a valuable tool for video productions, helping to streamline the creation of storyboards and spark creativity in the process."

        "value": "For education purposes only. The following discussion is aimed at expert physicians and covers important issues to consider when treating a patient with lithium who has a history of urinary incontinence.\n\n1. Drug interactions: Assess the patient's medication list to identify any drugs that may exacerbate urinary incontinence, such as diuretics, alpha-blockers, or cholinergic agents. Adjust the medications accordingly, and monitor for potential drug interactions that may affect lithium levels or renal function.\n2. Lithium's diuretic effect: Lithium can cause polyuria and polydipsia due to its effect on the renal collecting tubules, leading to decreased urine concentrating ability. This can exacerbate urinary incontinence in susceptible patients. Monitoring the patient's fluid intake and output, as well as adjusting the lithium dose if needed, can help manage this issue.\n3. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI): Lithium-induced NDI is a potential side effect of long-term lithium use. It can present with symptoms similar to urinary incontinence, such as increased thirst and frequent urination. Identifying and managing NDI is crucial to avoid dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and worsening incontinence.\n4. Monitoring lithium levels: Regularly monitor the patient's serum lithium levels to ensure they remain within the therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L). This is important to avoid exacerbating urinary incontinence due to polyuria and polydipsia, and to prevent lithium toxicity, which can have severe consequences, including renal impairment.\n5. Renal function monitoring: Monitor the patient's renal function regularly, as lithium has the potential to cause chronic kidney disease. Assess the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and electrolyte levels to ensure that the patient's renal function is stable.\n6. Non-pharmacological interventions: Encourage the patient to engage in pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and scheduled voiding regimens to help manage incontinence. In addition, recommend lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, smoking cessation, and caffeine reduction, which may help alleviate incontinence symptoms.\n7. Alternative mood stabilizers: If the patient's urinary incontinence remains uncontrolled or worsens, consider switching to an alternative mood stabilizer with a lower risk of urinary side effects, such as valproate, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine, after discussing the potential benefits and risks with the patient.\n8. Consultation with specialists: Collaborate with urologists, nephrologists, and psychiatrists as needed to optimize the patient's treatment plan and manage any complications related to lithium use and urinary incontinence.\n\nIn summary, treating a patient with lithium who has a history of urinary incontinence requires careful consideration of drug interactions, lithium's diuretic effect, NDI, and renal function. Monitoring lithium levels, employing non-pharmacological interventions, and collaborating with specialists can help optimize the patient's treatment plan and manage potential complications."

In this case, the script will have read-only access to the user's Google Documents.\n* `DOCUMENT_ID = '195j9eDD3ccgjQRttHhJPymLJUCOUjs-jmwTrekvdjFE'`: This line defines the ID of the Google Document that the script will retrieve and print the title of.\n* The `main()` function is the main entry point of the script. It first attempts to load the OAuth 2.0 credentials from a file called `token.json`. If the credentials are not valid (e.g. if the file does not exist or the credentials have expired), the function initiates the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to obtain new credentials. Once the credentials have been obtained, the function builds a client for interacting with the Google Docs API using the `build` function, and then retrieves and prints the title of the Google Document specified by the `DOCUMENT_ID` variable. If any HTTP errors occur when interacting with the API, they are caught and printed by the `except` clause at the end of the `try` block.\n* The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the bottom of the script specifies that the `main()` function should be called when the script is run directly (e.g. `python script.py`). This is a common pattern in Python scripts to allow them to be imported as modules in other scripts without automatically executing the code in the main block."

        "value": "Swapping is a technique used in memory management where the operating system moves pages or sections of memory between the main memory (RAM) and secondary storage devices such as hard disks, SSDs, or swap files.\n\nWhen the RAM is insufficient to hold all the required data and programs for the running process, the operating system swaps out some pages of memory from RAM to the secondary storage, freeing up memory space in RAM for other programs. Later, when the process requires the swapped-out pages, the operating system swaps them back into RAM.\n\nSwapping can be a time-consuming operation as it involves transferring data between the main memory and secondary storage devices, and can negatively affect system performance if it occurs frequently. However, it helps to increase the total amount of memory available to a process, allowing the system to run more programs than it would otherwise be able to handle."

        "value": "summarise the following information in short key points :\n\nProgram Threats\n There are many common threats to modern systems. Only a few are discussed here.\nTrojan Horse\n\n16\n\n A Trojan horse is a program that secretly performs some maliciousness in addition to its\nvisible actions.  Some Trojan horses are deliberately written as such, and others are the result of\nlegitimate programs that have become infected with viruses,  One dangerous opening for Trojan horses is long search paths, and in particular paths\nwhich include the current directory ( \".\" ) as part of the path. If a dangerous program\nhaving the same name as a legitimate program ( or a common mis-spelling, such as \"sl\"\ninstead of \"ls\" ) is placed anywhere on the path, then an unsuspecting user may be fooled\ninto running the wrong program by mistake.  Another classic Trojan Horse is a login emulator, which records a users account name\nand password, issues a \"password incorrect\" message, and then logs off the system. The\nuser then tries again (with a proper login prompt), logs in successfully, and doesn't realize\nthat their information has been stolen.  Two solutions to Trojan Horses are to have the system print usage statistics on logouts,\nand to require the typing of non-trappable key sequences such as Control-Alt-Delete in\norder to log in. (This is why modern Windows systems require the Control-Alt-Delete\nsequence to commence logging in, which cannot be emulated or caught by ordinary\nprograms. I.e. that key sequence always transfers control over to the operating system. )  Spyware is a version of a Trojan Horse that is often included in \"free\" software\ndownloaded off the Internet. Spyware programs generate pop-up browser windows, and\nmay also accumulate information about the user and deliver it to some central site. (This\nis an example of covert channels, in which surreptitious communications occur.) Another\ncommon task of spyware is to send out spam e-mail messages, which then purportedly\ncome from the infected user.\nTrap Door\n A Trap Door is when a designer or a programmer ( or hacker ) deliberately inserts a\nsecurity hole that they can use later to access the system.  Because of the possibility of trap doors, once a system has been in an untrustworthy state,\nthat system can never be trusted again. Even the backup tapes may contain a copy of\nsome cleverly hidden back door.  A clever trap door could be inserted into a compiler, so that any programs compiled with\nthat compiler would contain a security hole. This is especially dangerous, because\ninspection of the code being compiled would not reveal any problems.\nLogic Bomb\n A Logic Bomb is code that is not designed to cause havoc all the time, but only when a\ncertain set of circumstances occurs, such as when a particular date or time is reached or\nsome other noticeable event.\nStack and Buffer Overflow\n\n17\n\n This is a classic method of attack, which exploits bugs in system code that allows buffers\nto overflow. Consider what happens in the following code, for example, if argv[ 1 ]\nexceeds 256 characters:\no The strcpy command will overflow the buffer, overwriting adjacent areas of\nmemory.\no ( The problem could be avoided using strncpy, with a limit of 255 characters\ncopied plus room for the null byte. )\n\n#include\n#define BUFFER\\_SIZE 256\nint main( int argc, char \\* argv[ ] )\n{\nchar buffer[ BUFFER\\_SIZE ];\nif( argc < 2 )\nreturn -1;\nelse {\nstrcpy( buffer, argv[ 1 ] );\nreturn 0;\n}\n}\nFigure - C program with buffer-overflow condition.  So how does overflowing the buffer cause a security breach? Well the first step is to\nunderstand the structure of the stack in memory:\no The \"bottom\" of the stack is actually at a high memory address, and the stack\ngrows towards lower addresses.\no However the address of an array is the lowest address of the array, and higher\narray elements extend to higher addresses. ( I.e. an array \"grows\" towards the\nbottom of the stack.\no In particular, writing past the top of an array, as occurs when a buffer overflows\nwith too much input data, can eventually overwrite the return address, effectively\nchanging where the program jumps to when it returns.\n\n18\n\nFigure - The layout for a typical stack frame.  Now that we know how to change where the program returns to by overflowing the\nbuffer, the second step is to insert some nefarious code, and then get the program to jump\nto our inserted code.  Our only opportunity to enter code is via the input into the buffer, which means there isn't\nroom for very much. One of the simplest and most obvious approaches is to insert the\ncode for \"exec (/bin/sh)\". To do this requires compiling a program that contains this\ninstruction, and then using an assembler or debugging tool to extract the minimum extent\nthat includes the necessary instructions.  The bad code is then padded with as many extra bytes as are needed to overflow the\nbuffer to the correct extent, and the address of the buffer inserted into the return address\nlocation. (Note, however, that neither the bad code nor the padding can contain null\nbytes, which would terminate the strcpy.)  The resulting block of information is provided as \"input\", copied into the buffer by the\noriginal program, and then the return statement causes control to jump to the location of\nthe buffer and start executing the code to launch a shell.\n\n19\n\nFigure : Hypothetical stack frame for (a) before and (b) after.  Fortunately modern hardware now includes a bit in the page tables to mark certain pages\nas non-executable. In this case the buffer-overflow attack would work up to a point, but\nas soon as it \"returns\" to an address in the data space and tries executing statements there,\nan exception would be thrown crashing the program.\nViruses\n A virus is a fragment of code embedded in an otherwise legitimate program, designed to\nreplicate itself ( by infecting other programs ), and ( eventually ) wreaking havoc.  Viruses are more likely to infect PCs than UNIX or other multi-user systems, because\nprograms in the latter systems have limited authority to modify other programs or to\naccess critical system structures ( such as the boot block. )  Viruses are delivered to systems in a virus dropper, usually some form of a Trojan Horse,\nand usually via e-mail or unsafe downloads.  Viruses take many forms (see below.) Figure shows typical operation of a boot sector\nvirus:\n\n20\n\nFigure - A boot-sector computer virus.\n\n21\n Some of the forms of viruses include:\n File - A file virus attaches itself to an executable file, causing it to run the virus\ncode first and then jump to the start of the original program. These viruses are\ntermed parasitic, because they do not leave any new files on the system, and the\noriginal program is still fully functional.\n Boot - A boot virus occupies the boot sector, and runs before the OS is loaded.\nThese are also known as memory viruses, because in operation they reside in\nmemory, and do not appear in the file system.\n Macro - These viruses exist as a macro (script) that is run automatically by\ncertain macro-capable programs such as MS Word or Excel. These viruses can\nexist in word processing documents or spreadsheet files.\n Source code viruses look for source code and infect it in order to spread.\n Polymorphic viruses change every time they spread - Not their underlying\nfunctionality, but just their signature, by which virus checkers recognize them.\n Encrypted viruses travel in encrypted form to escape detection. In practice they\nare self-decrypting, which then allows them to infect other files.\n Stealth viruses try to avoid detection by modifying parts of the system that could\nbe used to detect it. For example the read ( ) system call could be modified so that\nif an infected file is read the infected part gets skipped and the reader would see\nthe original unadulterated file.\n Tunneling viruses attempt to avoid detection by inserting themselves into the\ninterrupt handler chain, or into device drivers.\n Multipartite viruses attack multiple parts of the system, such as files, boot sector,\nand memory.\n Armored viruses are coded to make them hard for anti-virus researchers to\ndecode and understand. In addition many files associated with viruses are hidden,\nprotected, or given innocuous looking names such as \"...\".  In 2004 a virus exploited three bugs in Microsoft products to infect hundreds of Windows\nservers ( including many trusted sites ) running Microsoft Internet Information Server,\nwhich in turn infected any Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser that visited any of\nthe infected server sites. One of the back-door programs it installed was a keystroke\nlogger, which records user’s keystrokes, including passwords and other sensitive\ninformation.  There is some debate in the computing community as to whether a monoculture, in\nwhich nearly all systems run the same hardware, operating system, and applications,\nincreases the threat of viruses and the potential for harm caused by them."

The code contains useful comments that describe the purpose of the different parts of the code.\n4. The method signature for `calculate` method is clear and has good documentation.\n5. The `calculate` method first checks if the tutor earnings price complement is already set on the booking, and if not, calculates it using the `TakeRateCalculatorFactory` class.

The `percentageStringToInt` method is only used within the `TutorEarningsPriceComplementCalculator` class, so it is appropriate to make it a private method.\n7.

Get the maximum number of concurrent requests allowed and store it in `max_concurrent_requests`. This value is obtained from an asynchronous function `get_max_concurrent_requests().await`.\n2. Log the value of `max_concurrent_requests` for debugging purposes.\n3. Calculate the total number of jobs using the length of the `results` vector and store it in `total_jobs`.\n4.

The semaphore is wrapped in an `Arc` (atomic reference counting) to safely share it across multiple tasks.\n5.

The `Mutex` is also wrapped in an `Arc` for sharing purposes.\n\nNow, let's dive into the \".map...\" part:\n\n1. The range `(0..total_jobs)` creates an iterator over the numbers from `0` to `total_jobs - 1`. This iterator is used to spawn tasks for each job.\n2. The `.map(|i| { ... })` function takes a closure as its argument. It applies this closure to each element in the range, effectively creating a new task for each job index `i`.

The `.collect::<Vec<_>>()` function collects the spawned tasks into a `Vec` of tasks.\n4. `futures::future::join_all(tasks).await` waits for all the tasks in the `Vec` to complete."

Some key points that make KNeighborsClassifier a good choice for facial recognition include:\n\n1. Easy to Implement: KNeighborsClassifier is a simple algorithm to implement, and doesn't require a lot of computational resources. This makes it a good choice for smaller projects and applications.\n2. Fast Training Time: The KNeighborsClassifier model has a very fast training time, since it simply stores the training data and does not do any computations until it is time to predict.\n3. High Accuracy: KNeighborsClassifier has been shown to be highly accurate for facial recognition, especially when the number of neighbors is set appropriately.\n4. Flexible Distance Metrics: KNeighborsClassifier allows for different distance metrics to be used, which can be helpful when dealing with different types of data.\n5. Non-Parametric: KNeighborsClassifier is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This can be an advantage in situations where the data is not normally distributed.\n6. Robust to Noise: KNeighborsClassifier can be robust to noisy data, since it looks at the k nearest neighbors and takes a majority vote to classify the data. This can help reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points.\n\nOverall, KNeighborsClassifier can be a good choice for facial recognition tasks due to its ease of implementation, fast training time, high accuracy, and robustness to noise."

        "value": "To create a mod for Minecraft in Java, you will need to use the Minecraft Forge modding platform. This platform provides a set of tools and APIs that allow you to create custom behavior for Minecraft.\n\nTo implement a block that causes the player to float when they stand on it, you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Create a new class that extends the `Block` class from the Minecraft Forge API. This class will define the properties and behavior of your custom block.\n2. In the `Block` class, you will need to override the `onEntityWalk` method. This method is called whenever an entity (such as a player) walks on top of the block.\n3. In the `onEntityWalk` method, you can use the `entity.addVelocity` method to add a upward velocity to the entity. This will cause the entity to start moving upward, simulating the effect of floating.\n\nHere is an example of how this might be implemented in code:\n```\npublic class FloatingBlock extends Block {\n    public FloatingBlock() {\n        // Set the properties of the block, such as its material, hardness, and resistance to explosions.\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onEntityWalk(World world, BlockPos pos, Entity entity) {\n        // Add an upward velocity to the entity to make it float.\n        entity.addVelocity(0, 0.5, 0);\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that this is just an example, and there may be additional steps or considerations involved in creating a Minecraft mod. For more information and detailed instructions, you can check out the Minecraft Forge documentation and tutorials."

Gavin becomes increasingly agitated, and in a fit of rage, he accidentally spills his drink on Larry's expensive rug.\n\nLarry is livid, and he and Gavin engage in a heated argument. In the midst of the chaos, Richard sees an opportunity to strike a deal with Larry. He proposes a partnership between Pied Piper and Larry's production company to create a revolutionary new streaming platform.\n\nLarry is intrigued by the idea, and the two come to an agreement. With the support of Larry and the expertise of the Pied Piper team, they set out to take on the tech giants of Silicon Valley and revolutionize the industry.\n\nBut just as things are looking up for Pied Piper, Gavin and Hooli come up with a devious plan to sabotage the company. In a thrilling showdown, Richard and the team must outsmart their rivals and protect their technology before it's too late.\n\nWith the help of Larry and his unique brand of humor, they emerge victorious and cement their place as the leaders of the new tech frontier. The unlikely partnership between Silicon Valley and Curb Your Enthusiasm proves to be a winning combination, and a new era of innovation is born."

Calculate the middle index of the list by taking the average of `low` and `high`: `mid = (low + high) / 2`.\n4. Compare the username you are looking for with the username at the middle index of the list.\n5. If the username matches, return true.\n6.

The `board_layout` list of lists defines the layout of the figures on the board. The `get_neighbors` function returns a list of neighboring figures for a given figure. The `get_interpretation` function uses the `figure_characteristics` and `get_neighbors` functions to generate an interpretation for a given figure, taking into account the characteristics of its neighboring figures. Finally, the `interpretation` variable is set by calling `get_interpretation` with the row and column indices of the desired figure."

Each context has its own browser instance and can have multiple pages.\n\nWhen you create a new context, a new browser instance is launched with a separate browser profile, which means that cookies, local storage, and other browser data are isolated between different contexts. This can be useful for testing scenarios where you want to ensure that each test starts with a clean slate.\n\nPages, on the other hand, are instances of web pages within a context. They are created when you navigate to a URL or when a new tab is opened within a context. You can interact with pages using Playwright's API to perform various actions like clicking on elements, filling out forms, and taking screenshots.\n\nThe relationship between contexts and pages is that a context can have multiple pages, and each page belongs to a single context. When you create a new context, you can optionally specify the number of pages to create within that context. If you don't specify a number, a default of one page per context is used.\n\nOverall, the use of contexts and pages in Playwright Python framework allows for flexible and efficient automation of web browsing tasks."

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "To merge an interval into a `Vec` of intervals sorted by the start of the interval in Rust, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Define a structure or tuple to represent the interval, with fields for the start and end of the interval.\n2. Implement the `PartialOrd` trait for the interval structure, so that it can be sorted by the start of the interval.\n3. Define a function that takes the `Vec` of intervals and the interval to be merged as arguments.\n4. Sort the `Vec` of intervals using the `sort_unstable` method, which sorts the intervals in place in ascending order according to their start.\n5. Iterate through the sorted intervals and compare the end of each interval with the start of the interval to be merged. If the end of an interval is greater than or equal to the start of the interval to be merged, then the intervals overlap and can be merged into a single interval with the minimum start and the maximum end.\n6. If the interval to be merged does not overlap with any of the intervals in the `Vec`, then it can be added to the `Vec` using the `push` method.\n\nHere is an example of how this can be implemented in Rust:\n```\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\n\n// Define a structure to represent the interval.\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Interval {\n    start: i32,\n    end: i32,\n}\n\n// Implement the PartialOrd trait for the interval structure.\nimpl PartialOrd for Interval {\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {\n        // Compare the start of the intervals.\n        self.start.partial_cmp(&other.start)\n    }\n}\n\n// Define a function to merge an interval into a Vec of intervals.\nfn merge_interval(intervals: &mut Vec<Interval>, interval: Interval) {\n    // Sort the Vec of intervals in ascending order by start.\n    intervals.sort_unstable();\n\n    // Iterate through the sorted intervals.\n    for i in 0..intervals.len() {\n        let current = &intervals[i];\n\n        // If the end of the current interval is greater than or equal to the start of the interval\n        // to be merged, then the intervals overlap and can be merged.\n        if current.end >= interval.start {\n            // Create a new interval with the minimum start and the maximum end.\n            let merged = Interval {\n                start: std::cmp::min(current.start, interval.start),\n                end: std::cmp::max(current.end, interval.end),\n            };\n\n            // Replace the current interval with the merged interval.\n            intervals[i] = merged;\n\n            // Return from the function.\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If the interval to be merged does not overlap with any of the intervals in the Vec, then\n    // add it to the Vec using the push method.\n    intervals.push(interval);\n}\n\n// Test the merge_interval function.\nfn main() {\n    let mut intervals = vec![\n        Interval { start: 1, end: 3 },\n        Interval { start: 6, end: 9 },\n    ];\n    let interval = Interval { start: 2, end: 5 };\n    merge_interval(&mut intervals, interval\n```"

Both options have their own set of pros and cons and you can choose the one that best fits your project's requirements."

The algorithm repeats this process until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.\n\nOne key aspect of the bubble sort algorithm is that it is very simple to understand and implement. However, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for larger lists. There are many other algorithms that are faster and more efficient, such as quicksort, heapsort, and merge sort."

So, we can rewrite the problem as:\n\n3/4 ÷ 1/6 = 3/4 × 6/1\n\nNext, we can simplify the fraction by canceling out any common factors. In this case, 3 and 6 have a common factor of 3, so we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n3/4 × 6/1 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9/2 or 4 1/2."

Developing a vaccine that is effective against the specific virus causing the illness should be a priority. Vaccination programs should be implemented as soon as possible to protect as many people as possible.\n2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): PPE, such as masks, gloves, and gowns, can help prevent the spread of airborne viral illness. PPE should be made available to all healthcare workers and others at risk of exposure.\n3. Social distancing: Social distancing measures, such as staying at least 6 feet away from others, can help prevent the spread of airborne viral illness. This measure should be implemented in public places, schools, and workplaces.\n4. Improved ventilation: Improved ventilation in public places, schools, and workplaces can help reduce the concentration of airborne viral particles.\n5. Quarantine and isolation: Quarantine and isolation measures should be implemented for individuals who have been infected with the airborne viral illness to prevent them from spreading it to others.\n6. Contact tracing: Contact tracing is essential to identify individuals who have been in close contact with infected individuals. Those individuals can be tested and isolated to prevent further spread of the airborne viral illness.\n7. Public education: Public education campaigns should be implemented to inform the public about the risks of the airborne viral illness and the steps they can take to protect themselves and others."

Market approach: This method compares the business being valued to similar businesses that have recently been sold or are currently for sale. The value of the business is determined based on the sale prices of these comparable businesses.\n3. Asset-based approach: This method values a business based on the value of its assets, such as property, equipment, and inventory. The value of the business is determined by adding up the value of these assets and subtracting any liabilities.\n4. Cost approach: This method values a business based on the cost of replacing its assets, such as the cost of building a new factory or purchasing new equipment.\n\nThere are also other methods that may be used in specific circumstances, such as the discounted cash flow method and the excess earnings method. The choice of valuation method will depend on the specific circumstances of the business being valued and the purpose of the valuation."

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "There are a few potential vulnerabilities and issues in this code:\n\n1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):\nIn the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view, the `certification_request` object is fetched using the `id` from the request data without any access control checks. This means that any authenticated user can potentially manipulate other users' certification requests by simply providing their request IDs. To fix this, you should check if the current user has the necessary permissions to modify the certification request.\n2. Unhandled exceptions:\nThe `CertificationRequest.objects.get(id=request.data['id'])` call in the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view might raise a `CertificationRequest.DoesNotExist` exception if the object is not found. You should catch this exception and return an appropriate error message instead of letting the server raise a 500 Internal Server Error.\n3. Improper usage of Enums:\nIn the `GetCertificationStatus` view, the `for s in Competence:` loop assumes that `Competence` is iterable, but it is not clear whether it is an Enum class or a model. If `Competence` is a Django model, the loop should be `for s in Competence.objects.all():`, and if it is an Enum, you should use `for s in Competence:`.\n4. Lack of filtering based on user role:\nIn the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view, there are no checks to ensure that only users with the appropriate role can accept or decline certification requests. You should implement additional access control checks based on user roles (e.g., admin, volunteer) before allowing users to change the status of a certification request.\n5. Mixed use of string literals and Enum values:\nIn the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view, you compare the status from the request data to string literals 'A' and 'D', but you set the status of the `certification_request` object to `Status.ACCEPTED` and `Status.DECLINED`. This could lead to inconsistencies if the Enum values change in the future. It would be better to use the Enum values consistently throughout the code."

In this technical document, we will explain how our AI tool works and the technologies involved in its development.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nOur content repurposing AI tool is built using various technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and computer vision. The tool comprises three main components: Input Processor, AI Model, and Output Generator.\n\n1. Input Processor:\n\nThe input processor component of our AI tool is responsible for ingesting the raw content, which can be in the form of text, audio, or video. This component uses NLP to process the text and audio inputs and computer vision to process the video input. The input processor uses various NLP techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis to extract meaningful information from the text.\n\n1. AI Model:\n\nThe AI model is the core component of our content repurposing AI tool. This component uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the input data and determine the most appropriate content format based on the content type, topic, and target audience. The AI model is trained on a large dataset of existing content and their corresponding repurposed formats to learn the patterns and relationships between them.\n\n1. Output Generator:\n\nThe output generator component of our AI tool is responsible for generating the repurposed content based on the input data and the output format selected by the AI model. The output generator uses various algorithms and techniques such as text summarization, language translation, and image and video processing to create the repurposed content. The output generator also optimizes the content for the selected format to ensure it meets the requirements of the target platform.\n\nHow it Works:\n\nThe content repurposing AI tool works by following a set of steps, which are as follows:\n\nStep 1: Input Processing\n\nThe tool ingests the raw content, which can be in the form of text, audio, or video. The input processor component uses NLP to process the text and audio inputs and computer vision to process the video input. The input processor extracts meaningful information from the raw content and converts it into a structured format that can be analyzed by the AI model.\n\nStep 2: AI Model Selection\n\nThe AI model analyzes the input data and determines the most appropriate content format based on the content type, topic, and target audience. The AI model selects the optimal repurposing format from a set of predefined formats such as video, social media post, blog, infographic, and more.\n\nStep 3: Output Generation\n\nThe output generator component of our AI tool generates the repurposed content based on the input data and the output format selected by the AI model. The output generator uses various algorithms and techniques such as text summarization, language translation, and image and video processing to create the repurposed content. The output generator also optimizes the content for the selected format to ensure it meets the requirements of the target platform.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur content repurposing AI tool is a powerful solution for businesses and content creators looking to save time and effort in repurposing their existing content into various formats. The tool uses advanced technologies such as NLP, machine learning, and computer vision to process the input data, select the most appropriate repurposing format, and generate high-quality repurposed content. With our AI tool, businesses and content creators can focus on creating new content while leaving the tedious and time-consuming task of repurposing to our advanced AI technology."

        "value": "To: Law Firm Partners\nFrom: Former Managing Partner and Management Advisor\nSubject: Widely Varying Profitability in Single Plaintiff Litigation Work\n\nAs an employment practice, you may face the challenge of dealing with widely varying profitability within your single plaintiff litigation work. This is a common problem that many law firms encounter and can lead to a significant impact on the firm's overall financial performance. In this memo, we will discuss both sides of the argument and present valid arguments for each side, refuting opposing points of view, and drawing persuasive conclusions based on evidence. Our goal is to help you come away from the discussion with increased knowledge and insight into the topic.\n\nArgument #1: Focus on high-profit cases\nOne possible solution to address widely varying profitability within your single plaintiff litigation work is to focus on high-profit cases. This approach involves identifying cases that are likely to generate the highest profit margins and devoting more resources to these cases.\n\nProponents of this approach argue that by focusing on high-profit cases, firms can maximize their return on investment and ensure that their efforts are directed towards cases that are most likely to yield significant financial returns. This approach can also help to reduce the amount of time and resources spent on low-profit cases, which can ultimately result in better profitability for the firm.\n\nFor instance, a law firm in California, specializing in employment law, decided to focus more on wrongful termination cases, which are known for their high-profit margins. By doing so, the firm was able to achieve significant profitability and increased its revenue by over 20% in the first year alone.\n\nArgument #2: Balance high-profit and low-profit cases\nAnother approach to address widely varying profitability within your single plaintiff litigation work is to balance high-profit and low-profit cases. This approach involves taking on a mix of cases with varying profit margins and allocating resources accordingly.\n\nProponents of this approach argue that by taking on a mix of high-profit and low-profit cases, firms can ensure a steady stream of revenue while also minimizing the risk associated with relying solely on high-profit cases. This approach can also help to ensure that the firm maintains a diverse portfolio of cases and is not overly dependent on any one particular area of practice.\n\nFor instance, a law firm in New York City, specializing in employment law, took on a mix of high-profit and low-profit cases. Although the low-profit cases were not as financially lucrative, they helped to ensure that the firm had a steady stream of revenue and provided opportunities for the firm's junior attorneys to gain valuable experience. As a result, the firm was able to maintain a stable financial performance over several years, even during economic downturns.\n\nCounterarguments:\nWhile both approaches have their merits, there are also potential drawbacks that should be considered. For instance, focusing solely on high-profit cases can lead to missed opportunities to take on cases with significant social impact or cases that may have a lower profit margin but could still generate substantial goodwill and positive publicity for the firm. Similarly, balancing high-profit and low-profit cases could result in an overly diverse portfolio of cases that could dilute the firm's expertise and make it difficult to establish a strong reputation in any one particular area of practice.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the approach that a law firm should take to address widely varying profitability within its single plaintiff litigation work will ultimately depend on the firm's unique circumstances and goals. While focusing on high-profit cases may be appropriate for some firms, others may find that balancing high-profit and low-profit cases is a more effective approach. It's also important to consider the potential drawbacks of each approach and evaluate how they may impact the firm's overall financial performance and reputation.\n\nRegardless of which approach a firm chooses, it's essential to track and measure key business metrics such as revenue, profit margin, and return on investment to ensure that the firm is"

        "value": "Sure! Here's a basic outline for a card game about mushroom hunting:\n\nGame Description\n================\n\nThe goal of the game is to be the first player to collect a set of rare mushrooms, known as the \"Mushroom Trio.\" Players will take turns drawing cards, searching for mushrooms in the forest, and trying to outwit their opponents by playing action cards to disrupt their progress.\n\nComponents\n----------\n\n* Deck of cards: The deck should include a variety of mushroom cards (each representing a different type of mushroom), action cards, and \"wild\" cards that can be used as any type of mushroom.\n* Play area: Each player will have a play area where they can lay out the mushrooms they have collected.\n* Mushroom Trio: The Mushroom Trio consists of three rare mushroom cards that are set aside at the beginning of the game.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\n1. Shuffle the deck of cards and deal a certain number (e.g., 7) to each player.\n2. Choose the Mushroom Trio by randomly selecting three mushroom cards and setting them aside.\n3. The player to the left of the dealer goes first.\n\nGameplay\n--------\n\nOn each turn, a player can do one of the following:\n\n1. Draw a card from the deck.\n2. Play a mushroom card from their hand onto their play area, if they have the necessary resources (e.g., a certain number of wild cards).\n3. Play an action card to disrupt an opponent's progress (e.g., steal a mushroom from another player, force an opponent to discard a card).\n\nThe game ends when one player has collected all three mushrooms in the Mushroom Trio and has played them onto their play area. That player is the winner.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThere are many ways you could modify this basic outline to create a more complex or interesting game. For example, you could include additional action cards that allow players to search for mushrooms in different parts of the forest, or you could add special abilities to certain mushroom cards that give players an advantage in certain situations. You could also include a scoring system to determine the winner in the event that multiple players collect the Mushroom Trio at the same time."

The exact appearance of an ion trap can vary depending on its specific design and the materials used to construct it. However, here is a general description of what an ion trap might look like:\n\nThe ion trap typically consists of a set of electrodes that are arranged in a particular configuration to produce a stable electric field that can trap charged particles, such as ions. The electrodes are usually made of metal and are typically arranged in a cylindrical or planar shape.\n\nIn a common type of ion trap, called a Paul trap, the electrodes are arranged in a set of three pairs, with each pair consisting of a ring-shaped electrode and a hyperbolic electrode. The rings are connected to a radio-frequency (RF) voltage source, while the hyperbolic electrodes are held at a static voltage.\n\nIons are introduced into the ion trap through a small opening in one of the electrodes. The RF voltage applied to the ring electrodes creates a rapidly oscillating electric field that traps the ions in a small region in the center of the trap, where the electric field is most intense.\n\nThe trapped ions can be manipulated using additional electric fields, such as a static electric field applied to one or more of the electrodes, or a laser beam directed at the ions. These manipulations can be used to cool the ions to near absolute zero, measure their properties, or entangle them with other particles.\n\nIon traps can be used in a variety of applications, including quantum computing, precision measurements, and spectroscopy."

This led to a severe economic decline, as these individuals were a crucial component of Uganda's economy.\n\nAmin was also notorious for his brutal treatment of political opponents, journalists, and anyone who opposed him. Many were killed, tortured, or disappeared without a trace. Amin also established a secret police force, which was responsible for countless human rights violations.\n\nThe regime was also characterized by a cult of personality, with Amin presenting himself as a larger-than-life figure who was above the law. He awarded himself several military titles, and his official title was \"His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.\"\n\nUnder Amin, Uganda became increasingly isolated from the international community. The country's economy was in shambles, and many of its citizens lived in poverty. The healthcare system and other public services were severely underfunded, and many basic needs went unmet.\n\nIn summary, Uganda under Idi Amin's dictatorship was marked by brutality, corruption, and economic decline. His regime is widely regarded as one of the darkest periods in Ugandan history."

This widget allows us to load an image from a URL and cache it for future use.\n\nTo use this approach, we'll need to do the following steps:\n\n1. Add the `cached_network_image` package to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  cached_network_image: ^3.1.0\n```\n2. Import the package in the Dart file where you want to use it:\n```python\nimport 'package:cached_network_image/cached_network_image.dart';\n```\n3. Wrap the `GoogleMap` widget inside a `CachedNetworkImage` widget and provide the `imageUrl` argument with a URL pointing to a static image of the map:\n```less\nCachedNetworkImage(\n  imageUrl: 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=37.7749,-122.4194&zoom=13&size=600x300&maptype=roadmap&markers=color:red%7Clabel:C%7C37.7749,-122.4194',\n  imageBuilder: (context, imageProvider) => GoogleMap(\n    initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(\n      target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),\n      zoom: 13,\n    ),\n    markers: Set<Marker>.of([\n      Marker(\n        markerId: MarkerId('currentLocation'),\n        position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),\n        infoWindow: InfoWindow(\n          title: 'Current Location',\n        ),\n      ),\n    ]),\n  ),\n);\n```\nNote that in the `imageUrl` argument, we're using the Google Maps Static API to generate a static map image for the specified location and zoom level.\n\nAlso, we're providing the `imageBuilder` argument to the `CachedNetworkImage` widget, which is a callback function that returns the widget to be displayed once the image is loaded from the cache or network. In this case, we're returning the `GoogleMap` widget with the appropriate initial camera position and markers.\n\nThat's it! With this approach, the map will be cached and displayed from the cache on subsequent loads, providing a faster and smoother user experience."

I'll find out everything you know about Pigsy, and I'll make him regret ever taking you in.\"\n\nMK was trembling with fear, but he managed to speak up.\n\nMK: \"Please, Sun Wukong, I didn't mean to—\"\n\nWukong grabbed him by the hair and dragged him out of the cave.\n\nWukong: \"Silence! You've already caused enough trouble. I'm taking you somewhere more secure, where you won't be able to pull any more stunts like this.\"\n\nMK struggled to break free, but Wukong was too strong. He dragged MK deeper into the mountains, to a hidden cave that looked even more foreboding than the last.\n\nMK knew he was in serious trouble now. He couldn't let Pigsy and the others risk their lives to help him again, but he also couldn't bear the thought of spending the rest of his life trapped like this."

Every day, he would look at his reflection in the sparkling river and imagine scales instead of fur, a long tail instead of a stubby one, and powerful jaws that could snap down on anything in an instant.\n\nBarnaby tried everything he could think of to become an alligator. He would spend hours basking in the sun, hoping to grow scaly skin, and he practiced opening his mouth wide like a fearsome gator, but it only made him yawn. He even attempted to swim with the grace of an alligator, but his large bear body only caused him to clumsily splash about. No matter how hard he tried, Barnaby remained a bear.\n\nAs the days went by, Barnaby's unsuccessful attempts led him to fall into a depression spiral. He lost interest in playing with the other animals, barely ate, and spent most of his time alone in his cave, wallowing in his self-pity.\n\nOne day, while Barnaby was lying in his cave, feeling hopeless, he received an unexpected visit from two rather peculiar characters: a muscular kangaroo named Kip and a beefy capybara named Cappy. They had heard about Barnaby's plight and decided they wanted to help him find happiness again.\n\nKip, the kangaroo, encouraged Barnaby to try different forms of exercise, like jumping and boxing, to improve his mood. He showed Barnaby that even as a bear, he could be agile and strong. On the other hand, Cappy, the capybara, introduced Barnaby to the art of relaxation and meditation, teaching him how to find inner peace and accept himself for who he was.\n\nAs the weeks went by, Barnaby began to rediscover the joy of living, and with Kip and Cappy's support, he started to embrace his bear identity. He realized that there were many amazing things about being a bear: the powerful strength in his limbs, the warmth of his thick fur, and the simple joy of catching fish in the river.\n\nWith newfound pride in himself, Barnaby became an inspiration to the other animals in Whimsywood. He no longer yearned to be an alligator, for he had discovered the beauty and power within himself as a bear.\n\nFrom then on, Barnaby, Kip, and Cappy became the best of friends, exploring the wonders of Whimsywood together and spreading joy and self-acceptance wherever they went. Barnaby's story taught the animals of the forest that happiness and true fulfillment come from embracing and celebrating one's true nature, rather than trying to be something else. And so, Barnaby the bear lived happily ever after, proud to be a bear, surrounded by friends who loved and appreciated him just the way he was."

For example, CRISPR could be used to edit the genes of adult stem cells to correct a mutation that is causing a genetic disease. The edited stem cells could then be transplanted back into the patient, where they could differentiate into the cell type that is affected by the disease and help to restore normal function.\n\nAnother potential application is cancer therapy. Adult stem cells could be used to deliver CRISPR to cancer cells in order to edit their genes and inhibit their ability to divide and proliferate. This approach could be used to treat a variety of different types of cancer.\n\nIn addition to these applications, CRISPR and adult stem cells could also potentially be used to treat other diseases and disorders, such as degenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, and injuries.

        "value": "GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to run multiple shells in a single terminal window, detach and reattach them later, and more. While it's not designed to be a queueing system per se, you can use Screen in conjunction with some shell scripting to achieve a simple queueing system.\n\nHere's a general approach you can take:\n\n1. Create a script that represents a job to be executed. This script should take whatever arguments it needs and perform some work, then exit. For example, let's say you have a script called `process.sh` that takes a filename as an argument and processes it somehow:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Processing $1\"\n# Do some work with the file\n```\n1. Create a script that will act as the queue manager. This script will create new Screen windows for each job and run the job scripts within them. It will also keep track of which jobs have been completed and remove them from the queue. Here's an example of what this script might look like:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Create a new Screen session\nscreen -d -m -S queue\n\n# Loop through the list of jobs\nfor job in job1 job2 job3; do\n    # Create a new Screen window for this job\n    screen -S queue -X screen -t \"$job\"\n\n    # Run the job script in the new window\n    screen -S queue -p \"$job\" -X stuff \"./process.sh $job\\n\"\n\n    # Wait a bit to avoid overloading the system\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\n# Wait for all jobs to complete\nwhile screen -ls | grep -q queue; do\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\n# All jobs have completed, exit\nexit 0\n```\nIn this example, the script assumes that there are three jobs to be processed (`job1`, `job2`, and `job3`). You would need to modify this to match your specific use case.\n\n1. Start the queue manager script and let it run. You can detach from the Screen session using the `Ctrl+A D` keystroke combination. You can then reattach to it later using the `screen -r` command.\n2. As new jobs come in, add them to the list of jobs in the queue manager script and restart the script. The new jobs will be added to the queue and processed when the existing jobs have completed.\n\nNote that this is a very simple queueing system that doesn't provide many features beyond basic job processing. If you need a more robust queueing system, there are many other tools available, such as Celery, RabbitMQ, and others."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Yes, it is possible to use a transformer or attention model with time series of different timeframes. This is known as multi-resolution modeling or hierarchical modeling.\n\nIn your example, you have 4 time series with daily data and monthly forecasts of 5 other variables for each one of the dates in the daily data. You can use the daily data as the high-resolution time series and the monthly forecasts as the low-resolution time series. The idea is to use the low-resolution time series to provide context to the high-resolution time series. This is similar to how humans use different levels of abstraction to reason about the world.\n\nOne approach to implementing multi-resolution modeling is to use a multi-input model that takes both the high-resolution time series and the low-resolution time series as input. The low-resolution time series can be passed through a separate embedding layer before being combined with the high-resolution time series. The model can then use attention mechanisms to attend to both the high-resolution and low-resolution time series when making predictions.\n\nAnother approach is to use a hierarchical model that consists of multiple levels of abstraction. The first level can model the high-resolution time series, while the second level can model the low-resolution time series. The output of the second level can be used as input to the first level to provide context.\n\nOverall, multi-resolution modeling can be a powerful approach to modeling time series data with different timeframes. It allows the model to capture both short-term and long-term patterns and make more accurate predictions."

The first successful colony was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, and over the next several decades, more colonies were established, including Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Many of these colonies were founded for religious reasons, such as the Pilgrims who established Plymouth Colony in 1620.\n\nLife in the colonies was difficult, as the settlers had to contend with unfamiliar environments and native populations. However, the colonies thrived, and by the mid-18th century, they had become economically self-sufficient. As time passed, the relationship between the colonies and Great Britain began to deteriorate. The British government imposed taxes on the colonies without their consent, which led to growing resentment among the colonists. Tensions finally boiled over in 1775, with the outbreak of the American Revolution, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, recognizing the independence of the United States of America."

There are many other ways to do it, and the specific details will depend on the requirements of your soccer app."

With that said, here is a possible ranking of programming languages in terms of their relative ease of use for printing \"hello world\":\n\n1. Python: In Python, you can print \"hello world\" with a single line of code: `print(\"hello world\")`.\n2. JavaScript: In JavaScript, you can print \"hello world\" with the following code: `console.log(\"hello world\")`.\n3. Java: In Java, you can print \"hello world\" with the following code: `System.out.println(\"hello world\")`.\n4. C++: In C++, you can print \"hello world\" with the following code: `std::cout << \"hello world\" << std::endl;`.\n5. C#: In C#, you can print \"hello world\" with the following code: `Console.WriteLine(\"hello world\")`.\n\nAgain, this is just one possible ranking and the difficulty of using a particular language for printing \"hello world\" can vary depending on a person's background and experience."

I fed the tool a brief outline of what I wanted to write about, and then let it do its magic.\n\nAs I watched, the tool began spitting out sentences, one after another, each one building on the last to form coherent paragraphs. I was amazed by how well the AI was able to understand the topic and generate text that was on point and flowed smoothly.\n\nOf course, the AI is not perfect and there were some sentences that didn't quite fit or needed to be rephrased. But overall, I was impressed by how well the AI was able to assist me in writing this post.\n\nUsing AI to help with writing has many potential benefits. It can save time, especially for writers who are on a tight deadline or have a lot of content to produce. It can also help to improve the quality of writing by providing alternative phrasing and sentence structure. And for those who struggle with writer's block, AI can provide a helpful starting point for brainstorming ideas.\n\nOverall, I found the experience of using AI to write this blog post to be both fascinating and helpful. It allowed me to focus on the content and structure of the post, rather than getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty of individual words and sentences. And it resulted in a piece of writing that I am proud to share with you."

For example, if a farmer increases the number of workers on a plot of land, the additional output produced by each additional worker will eventually decrease. This is because at some point, the additional workers will not have enough land to work on or the necessary resources to be productive, leading to a decrease in the marginal increase in output.\n\nThe law of diminishing returns is an important concept in economics because it helps to explain why there are limits to production and why firms may not always choose to produce at the highest possible level. It also helps to explain why firms may choose to specialize in certain types of production and why trade can be beneficial for countries."

TMAO has been linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis in humans. The researchers also found that the gut microbiome plays a key role in the metabolism of L-carnitine to TMAO.\n\nWhile the study did not specifically examine the effects of Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR), it is possible that high doses of ALCAR could also lead to an increase in TMAO levels and a higher risk of atherosclerosis.

For example, research could be conducted to see how different age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds are identifying as traditionalists or progressives. This could provide insight into which groups are driving the shift and why.\n\nAnother approach would be to look at how political parties and candidates are responding to this shift. Are they adapting their platforms and messaging to appeal to traditionalists or progressives? Are they successfully reaching new voters or are they losing support from traditional constituencies?\n\nIt could also be interesting to explore how this shift in political labels is affecting policy-making and governance. Are traditionalists and progressives able to find common ground and compromise on issues, or is the divide between them becoming more entrenched? How is this affecting the ability of government to function and pass legislation?\n\nFinally, it is also worth considering the implications of this shift in political labels and ideologies on the wider society. Are traditionalists and progressives becoming more isolated from one another, or are they finding ways to bridge the divide and work together? How is this affecting social cohesion and the ability of society to address important issues?\n\nOverall, there are many different angles from which to approach this topic, and each one has the potential to shed new light on the shifting political landscape and its implications."

        "value": "The French Revolution, which lasted from 1789 to 1799, was one of the most significant events in modern history. It was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that had far-reaching consequences, not only for the country but for Europe and the world as a whole. This essay will explore the causes, key events, and outcomes of the French Revolution.\n\nCauses of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution was a response to the economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades. One of the main causes of the revolution was the country's deepening financial crisis. The French government was heavily in debt due to the cost of the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution, and the burden of this debt fell on the common people in the form of heavy taxes.\n\nAnother significant cause of the French Revolution was the country's outdated feudal system. The nobility and clergy held vast amounts of power and wealth, while the majority of the population, the peasants and middle class, were oppressed and excluded from political decision-making.\n\nKey Events of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase, which lasted from 1789 to 1792, was marked by the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nThe second phase, which lasted from 1792 to 1794, was characterized by the rise of the radical Jacobin faction, led by Maximilien Robespierre. During this phase, the king, Louis XVI, was executed, and a Reign of Terror ensued, during which thousands of people were executed for perceived counter-revolutionary activities.\n\nThe third phase, which lasted from 1794 to 1799, saw the fall of Robespierre and the rise of the Directory, a five-man governing body. During this phase, the French armies expanded their control over Europe, but the country continued to experience political instability and economic problems.\n\nOutcomes of the French Revolution\n\nThe French Revolution had a profound impact on France and the world. In France, the Revolution brought an end to the monarchy and the feudal system, established the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and created a modern, secular state.\n\nThe Revolution also had far-reaching effects on Europe and the world. It inspired similar revolutions in other countries, such as the Haitian Revolution, and helped to spread democratic ideas and values across the globe.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event that had profound consequences for France and the world. It was a response to economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades and was marked by key events such as the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, the execution of Louis XVI, and the Reign of Terror.\n\nThe Revolution's outcomes included the establishment of a modern, secular state in France and the spread of democratic ideas and values across the globe. Despite the challenges and controversies of the Revolution, it remains an important chapter in the history of the modern world."

Recent works have shown that chain-\nof-thought (CoT) prompting can elicit mod-\nels to solve complex reasoning tasks, step-by-\nstep. However, the efficacy of prompt-based\nCoT methods is restricted to very large LMs\nsuch as GPT-3 (175B), thus limiting deploy-\nability. In this paper, we revisit the fine-\ntuning approach to enable complex reasoning\nin smaller LMs, optimized to efficiently per-\nform a specific task. We propose Fine-tune-\nCoT, a method that leverages the capabilities\nof very large LMs to generate reasoning sam-\nples and teach smaller models via fine-tuning.\nWe evaluate our method on publicly available\nLMs across a wide range of complex tasks and\nmodel sizes. We find that Fine-tune-CoT en-\nables substantial reasoning capability in small\nmodels, whereas previous prompt-based base-\nlines exhibit near-random performance. Stu-\ndent models can even outperform the teacher\nin some tasks while reducing model size re-\nquirements by several orders of magnitude.\nWe conduct extensive ablations and sample\nstudies to understand the reasoning capabili-\nties of student models.

I'm 31 years old and I wanted so much more from life than this. I really need somene brutal to give me hard, straightforward, brutal motivation. No holding back.

Can you do that for me?\n\nYes, I can definitely do that for you. But before I start, I want you to know that what I'm about to say might be tough to hear, but it's coming from a place of tough love and a desire to see you succeed.\n\nFirstly, it's time for you to realize that you are the only one responsible for your life. Your girlfriend cheating on you is not an excuse for your lack of progress. You can't control other people's actions, but you can control how you respond to them. Staying in a toxic relationship will only drain your energy and distract you from focusing on what really matters.\n\nSecondly, it's time for you to take ownership of your career. You can't blame a lack of job opportunities for your unemployment. It's up to you to develop the skills necessary to stand out in a competitive job market. Take advantage of online courses, seminars, and workshops to improve your skillset. And don't be afraid to start at the bottom and work your way up.\n\nThirdly, it's time for you to take care of your physical health. Your body is your temple, and neglecting it will only lead to more problems down the road. Make exercise a priority, even if it's just a few minutes a day. And watch what you eat, as a healthy diet is crucial for maintaining a healthy body.\n\nLastly, it's time for you to stop making excuses and start taking action. No one can make you successful but yourself. It's time for you to step up and take charge of your life. You have the power to create the life you want, but it requires hard work, dedication, and a willingness to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Stop complaining and start doing. Get out of that toxic relationship, start learning new skills, take care of your body, and start taking action towards creating the life you want. You got this, but only if you're willing to put in the work."

Instead, it typically monitors the resistance or impedance of materials in the reactor, which can be affected by temperature changes. The SCRAM system uses this information to detect anomalies in the reactor and to initiate a shutdown when necessary.\n\nIn particular, the SCRAM system typically monitors the resistance or impedance of the fuel rods, which are designed to maintain a stable resistance at normal operating temperatures. When the fuel rods heat up due to an increase in power or a decrease in cooling, their resistance decreases. Conversely, if the fuel rods cool down too much, their resistance increases. These changes in resistance can be detected by the SCRAM system and used to determine if there is an anomaly in the reactor that requires a shutdown.\n\nIn addition to monitoring the resistance of the fuel rods, the SCRAM system may also monitor other parameters such as radiation levels, pressure, and flow rate. These parameters can also be affected by temperature changes and can provide additional information about the state of the reactor."

        "value": "Sure! Here is a regular expression that you can use to remove the string \"site\" and replace underscores with spaces:\n```\n/site|_/g\n```\nThis regular expression uses the `|` character, which is called a \"pipe\" and is used to match either the string \"site\" or the underscore character (`_`). The `g` at the end of the regular expression is a \"global\" flag, which means that the regular expression will match all occurrences of \"site\" or `_` in the input string, rather than just the first one.\n\nTo use this regular expression in a program, you would need to pass it to a regular expression-capable function along with the input string. For example, in JavaScript, you could use the `replace()` method on a string, like this:\n```\nvar input = \"this_is_a_test_string_with_the_word_site_in_it\";\nvar output = input.replace(/site|_/g, \"\");\n// Output: \"thisisateststringwiththewordiniti\"\n```\nIn this code, the `replace()` method is called on the `input` string, and it replaces all occurrences of \"site\" or `_` with the empty string (`\"\"`), which effectively removes those substrings from the input string.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

These messages are typically used to provide additional information about the script's execution, such as the values of variables or the status of certain operations.\n\nThe main difference between `Write-Output` and `Write-Debug` is that the output of the `Write-Output` cmdlet is displayed in the console by default, whereas the output of the `Write-Debug` cmdlet is not displayed in the console unless the `$DebugPreference` variable is set to `Continue`.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use `Write-Output` and `Write-Debug` in a script:\n```\n# Define a variable\n$myVariable = \"Hello, world!\"\n\n# Write the value of the variable to the console using Write-Output\nWrite-Output $myVariable\n\n# Write a debug message to the console using Write-Debug\nWrite-Debug \"The value of myVariable is $myVariable\"\n```\nIn this example, the `Write-Output` cmdlet will print the value of the `$myVariable` variable to the console, while the `Write-Debug` cmdlet will write a debug message to the console, but the message will not be displayed unless the `$DebugPreference` variable is set to `Continue`.\n\nI hope this helps!

The `&` operator is a logical operator that returns `$true` if both conditions are `$true`, and `$false` otherwise.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the `&` operator to check if two conditions are true at the same time:\n```\n# Check if the subdirectories are not the same object and their names are similar\nif ($subDir1 -noteq $subDir2 -and $subDir1.Name -like \"$($subDir2.Name)*\") {\n    # ...\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `if` statement uses the `&` operator to check if both the `-noteq` and `-like` conditions are true. If both conditions are true, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed.\n\nYou can then use this `if` statement to move the files from one subdirectory to the other, as follows:\n```\n# Check if the subdirectories are not the same object and their names are similar\nif ($subDir1 -noteq $subDir2 -and $subDir1.Name -like \"$($subDir2.Name)*\") {\n    # Get a list of all files in the first subdirectory\n    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $subDir1.FullName -File\n\n    # Loop through each file\n    foreach ($file in $files) {\n        # Move the file to the second subdirectory\n        Move-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $subDir2.FullName\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, the `if` statement uses the `&` operator to check if both the `-noteq` and `-like` conditions are true, and if they are, it moves all files from `$subDir1` to `$subDir2` using the `Move-Item` cmdlet.\n\nI hope this helps!

Define your terms:\n* Alpha: This refers to the very early stages of product development, where a product is being tested internally within a small group of people, usually the development team. The goal of an alpha is to test the feasibility and usability of a product before it is released to a larger group.\n* Beta: This refers to the testing phase of a product, where it is made available to a larger group of people, usually a representative sample of the target audience. The goal of a beta is to gather feedback and iron out any remaining issues before the product is released to the general public.\n* GA (General Availability): This refers to the point at which a product is considered ready for widespread use and is made available to the general public.\n1. Set criteria for each phase:\n* Alpha: For the alpha phase, you might consider using the following criteria:\n\t+ The product must be in a usable state and able to perform basic functions.\n\t+ The product must be tested internally by the development team to ensure it is stable and reliable.\n\t+ Any major issues identified during the alpha phase should be addressed before moving on to the beta phase.\n* Beta: For the beta phase, you might consider using the following criteria:\n\t+ The product must be in a state where it is ready for testing by a larger group of people.\n\t+ The product must be stable and reliable enough for external testing.\n\t+ Feedback from beta testers should be used to identify and resolve any remaining issues before the product is released to the general public.\n* GA: For the GA phase, you might consider using the following criteria:\n\t+ The product must be stable and reliable.\n\t+ Any remaining issues identified during the beta phase should be addressed.\n\t+ The product should be ready for widespread use.\n1. Set up processes for each phase:\n* Alpha: For the alpha phase, you might consider establishing the following processes:\n\t+ Set up a small group of internal testers, such as the development team, to test the product.\n\t+ Set up a feedback mechanism, such as a survey or user testing session, to gather feedback from internal testers.\n\t+ Set up a process for tracking and addressing issues identified during the alpha phase.\n* Beta: For the beta phase, you might consider establishing the following processes:\n\t+ Set up a larger group of testers, such as a representative sample of the target audience, to test the product.\n\t+ Set up a feedback mechanism, such as a survey or user testing session, to gather feedback from beta testers.\n\t+ Set up a process for tracking and addressing issues identified during the beta phase.\n* GA: For the GA phase, you might consider establishing the following processes:\n\t+ Make the product available to the general public.\n\t+ Set up a process for tracking and addressing any issues that arise after the product is released to the general public.\n1. Communicate and educate:\n* Make sure that all relevant stakeholders, including the product team and the rest of the organization, are aware of the definitions and processes for alphas, betas, and GAs.\n* Consider holding training sessions or creating documentation to educate team members on these processes.\n\nBy following this framework, you can establish clear definitions and processes for alphas, betas, and GAs and ensure that they are run consistently across the organization. This will help ensure that products are thoroughly tested and of high quality before they are released to the general public."

        "value": "Amplitude is an analytics tool that allows you to track user behavior in your applications. To send a date type event property to Amplitude, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. First, make sure you have integrated Amplitude SDK into your project. You can find the SDK for different platforms in the Amplitude Developer Center: <https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/>\n2. Create the event with a date type property. When sending event properties, it's crucial to make sure that the date is in a format recognized by Amplitude. Amplitude accepts dates as either Unix timestamps (integer or float, in seconds or milliseconds) or ISO 8601 date strings (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ).\n\nHere's an example in JavaScript using the Amplitude JavaScript SDK:\n```javascript\n// Import the Amplitude SDK\nimport amplitude from 'amplitude-js';\n\n// Initialize the Amplitude instance\nconst apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\namplitude.getInstance().init(apiKey);\n\n// Create a date object with the current date and time\nconst currentDate = new Date();\n\n// Format the date object as an ISO 8601 date string\nconst isoDateString = currentDate.toISOString();\n\n// Create the event with the date type property\nconst eventName = 'your_event_name';\nconst eventProperties = {\n  dateProperty: isoDateString, // or use `currentDate.getTime()` for Unix timestamp\n};\n\n// Log the event to Amplitude\namplitude.getInstance().logEvent(eventName, eventProperties);\n```\nReplace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Amplitude API key, and `your_event_name` with the name of the event you want to track. The `eventProperties` object should include the date type property you want to send.\n\nRemember that this is just an example using the JavaScript SDK. The process will be similar for other platforms (Android, iOS, etc.), but the code syntax and SDK methods will differ. Check the Amplitude Developer Center for platform-specific instructions: <https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/>"

Transcript: \"all right in the last few lessons we talked about setting up a niche we talked about finding a problem to solve we talked about pricing we talked about location dependence and now this is the final step in what you need to do to create your location independent high income low work alpha two penal business and what's interesting is that most guys or women when they start a business they focus on this step first and this is actually the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of mechanisms now where you can deliver hard services soft services information all kinds of things where you don't physically have to be there and then obviously you can get the money from the kleiner customer even if it's a lot of money without physically having to be there i do wire transfers all the time for big big big payments because i run three companies matter of fact just last week i did a wire transfer for what it was 20 000 to a company i do business with internationally and i didn't have to physically be there i'm set up on my online banking to do my own wire transfer so i don't to call a bank every time like most people do because again i'm location independent so this is your delivery system location independent that's the name of the game and if it's not location dependent if the client says i have to give you a check there are still people out there like this matter of fact my wife was just working with a person a little while ago and he was like no i only pay via check if they insist on paying checks you don't do business if it's an old school industry that insists on physically handing you a piece of paper for something you don't do business or you don't do that kind of business everything must be location dependent both the delivery system to the client and the payment system from the client or customer cool now again what most people do when they start a business is this is the first step they go okay i gotta set up a website and i gotta set up a way to you know email the stuff and i gotta set up a check account a paypal account and i gotta set up a merchant account and they do this before they've identified a niche before they've identified a problem before in many cases they even priced out their product or made an offer no this is the final step before you start hardcore marketing which we talked about in the last lesson this is it this is not the first step it's the last

YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yEWlVLEGeU\n\nTranscript:\n(00:00) welcome to day five the business builder challenge where we show you exactly how to create a high income high margin low work location independent alpha 2.0 business where you can make decent money location dependent without having to work too hard today we're going to cover your offer and your pricing so in the last video we talked about the six different areas in which you could choose to sell that item that will help people or companies achieve some kind of result so i'm assuming now you've picked\n(00:27) that already if you haven't that's okay but i'm assuming that you have or at least in terms of one of those six items there's one in your head you're like yeah i'd probably do that the next step is what exactly are you going to sell ebook course consulting service whatever and what problem is that going to solve for the customer this all revolves around the customer or client if you're doing business services or consulting you would call it a client if it's anything else in that list it\n(00:58) would be a customer doesn't matter but what is the problem that you're offering is going to help alleviate or solve with the customer or client because you start there hopefully you are niched you're talking about a very narrow niche a very narrow type of person or a very narrow type of company with a specific problem that you can help them with now the problem could be anything i don't know it could be anything from improving profitability to losing weight to getting laid to moving out of the\n(01:26) country these are a lot of topics i've either talked about or interested in the past that's why i'm using those topics but it could be anything really anything to think of it doesn't matter but those that's the first of two questions what is the problem it's trying to solve how is the condition of the customer going to be approved by them purchasing your information or your service start there if i'm your customer if i'm your client how is my condition going to improve and be as clear as you can not like\n(01:54) you'll be happier that's not very clear a better thing is you will increase profitability by 20 or so or you'll be able to schedule due dates on the calendar within three weeks of working with me or whatever it is try to quantify the actual improvement if you can't now you may say michaela this is a new business i've ever done this before i don't know then guess it's okay to guess as long as you're honest with prospects when you talk to them you can say look my guess based on my experience and my\n(02:23) knowledge is that i can get you an improvement that looks something like this i may not be exactly right because i am new but that's my guess and even if we only get 50 of that you will still improve so let's say you're going to be a consultant and you're going to help cut costs by 20 let's say let's say that's the number you've chosen if you go to a company and you save the owner or whoever's going to hire you look i could be wrong maybe i only save costs by 10 well that's a lot of money that's more\n(02:50) than worth your consulting fee and that leads into the second question how much is the improvement worth to the customer so if you come to me and you say caleb i'm gonna increase your sales by 20 that's worth a lot to me i would spend a lot of money on that because 20 for me is a lot of money so that means i'm happy to pay you a decent amount of money for that 20 percent now it doesn't have to be a financial thing again you can sell to individuals or you can sell the companies if you want to sell to individuals you could\n(03:22) use the example of one of my companies i teach dating advice for men and i show men how to get first dates with online dating and have non-monogamous relationships so i will say to them i can help you schedule first dates get first dates on the calendar and once you start dating new women i can show you how to date multiple women all at the same time and they all know you're dating other women and they continue to date you anyway without complaining about it that's one of the things i teach one of my companies how much money\n(03:46) is that worth that's worth a lot of money to men it's not a business thing is it there's no financial numbers attached that is there but it's such a cool result that i can charge a decent amount of money for men to buy my information to help them achieve that result make sense so those are two questions to start with in terms of your offer what is the improvement and how much is that improvement worth to your niche once you know those two things then you can go to the next step and figure out\n(04:12) how much it's going to cost what the pricing is if the improvement is significant and it's worth a lot to the niche then your price could be very high if your improvement is little or if your improvement is big but it's not deemed as very important to your niche then the price will have to be lower make sense the price is not based on what you are comfortable with most business owners charge under what they should be charging the price should be only based on value which means the value of the improvement you're giving the customer\n(04:41) or the client and that's it so if you're providing high value you can charge a lot of money there are ebooks that you can buy online for 300 and you may go what the hell why would i buy a book for 300 because they're highly highly niched and they're extremely valuable i bought an ebook once 20 years ago when the internet was new and ebooks were not even a thing i bought an ebook once for 200 it was 197 god caleb you're a why would you buy a book for 200 because it was a book on how to do cold\n(05:10) calls to get clients for your consulting business you see how niche that was and that's exactly what i was doing 20 years ago so i was happy to spend 200 on a book it's not like well the book is 40 pages so i guess i better charge two dollars for it no wrong incorrect there are online courses for a few videos that cost three thousand dollars there are there's only a few hours long but they cost three thousand because the value is so strong to that niche i knew a guy once who published a printed newsletter and it\n(05:41) only went out six times a year he would just bail it out six times a year and the subscription price for this newsletter like a little magazine was three thousand dollars a year now why was it so much because it was a very niche newsletter in the oil industry he was only targeting a very certain type of person in a very specific industry the oil industry so he was able to charge a lot of money because it was ditched and the value was very high so you don't charge based on the modality you charge based on the value it's\n(06:12) called value-based pricing it's extremely important that you don't under charge for what you're selling i don't want you to make that mistake and let's say you charge too much money you know what you cut your prices later it's not a big deal it really isn't it's harder to raise your prices later than to cut them later so i'd rather you start out on the high range of pricing based on the value and the value to the kleiner customer once again you are invited to the 90-day business\n(06:38) builder where we me

It checks if a valid admin token is provided. If not, it returns an error message and ends the process.\n2. It initializes an empty array called $tasks.\n3. It prepares a SQL query to select all columns from the tbl\\_task table, ordered by task\\_id in descending order.\n4. It executes the SQL query using the rm object's createCommand() method and queryAll() method, and stores the result in the $tasks array.\n5. It sets the response details with the retrieved tasks as the 'data' key.\n6. It sets the response code to 1, indicating a successful operation.\n7. It calls the output() method to send the response.\n\nThe code seems to be working correctly for its purpose, which is to retrieve tasks from the database and return them. However, I would recommend adding comments to the code to improve readability, and it's also a good practice to use more meaningful variable names.

Here's the updated code for both `actionAssignedByMe` and `actionAssignedToMe` functions, incorporating the provided SQL query:\n```php\npublic function actionAssignedByMe($status = null)\n{\n    $user_id = 1; // Replace this with the actual user ID from the session or other authentication\n\n    $criteria = new CDbCriteria();\n    $criteria->alias = 'i';\n    $criteria->select = array(\n        'i.invoices_id', 'i.due_date', 'i.reference_no', 'i.status', 'i.invoice_date',\n        'c.sync_id', 'c.merchant_name', 'c.merchant_phone', 'c.expires_date', 'c.last_login', 'c.client_id', 'c.name'\n    );\n    $criteria->join = 'INNER JOIN tbl_client c ON i.client_id = c.client_id';\n    $criteria->compare('i.assign_by', $user_id);\n\n    if ($status) {\n        $criteria->compare('i.status', $status);\n    }\n\n    $tasks = TblInvoices::model()->findAll($criteria);\n\n    $this->render('assigned_by_me', array(\n        'tasks' => $tasks\n    ));\n}\n\npublic function actionAssignedToMe($status = null)\n{\n    $user_id = 1; // Replace this with the actual user ID from the session or other authentication\n\n    $criteria = new CDbCriteria();\n    $criteria->alias = 'i';\n    $criteria->select = array(\n        'i.invoices_id', 'i.due_date', 'i.reference_no', 'i.status', 'i.invoice_date',\n        'c.sync_id', 'c.merchant_name', 'c.merchant_phone', 'c.expires_date', 'c.last_login', 'c.client_id', 'c.name'\n    );\n    $criteria->join = 'INNER JOIN tbl_client c ON i.client_id = c.client_id';\n    $criteria->compare('i.assign_to', $user_id);\n\n    if ($status) {\n        $criteria->compare('i.status', $status);\n    }\n\n    $tasks = TblInvoices::model()->findAll($criteria);\n\n    $this->render('assigned_to_me', array(\n        'tasks' => $tasks\n    ));\n}\n```\nThese updated functions use the provided SQL query by adding a `JOIN` statement and custom `SELECT` statement to the `CDbCriteria` object. The code for both functions is similar, with the only difference being the comparison of the `assign_by` or `assign_to` fields. The result will be an array of tasks, including the necessary fields from both `tbl_invoices` and `tbl_client` tables."
